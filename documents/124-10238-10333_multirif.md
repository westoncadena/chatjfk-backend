U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC requests contained in letter of Senator Frank Church dated November 7, 1975, for materials concerning Martin Luther King, Jr.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery to the SSC of information and materials in response to requests contained in the above SSC letter.

The attention of the SSC is invited to FBI memorandum dated November 11, 1975, which referred to a highly sensitive oral briefing furnished to Senator Church and selected members of the SSC Staff by FBI personnel on November 5, 1975. This briefing was intended, in part, to serve in lieu of any written information in response to SSC requests for communications documenting Stanley David Levison as a secret member of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA).

Because of SSC insistence in requesting items to establish factual basis for Levison's secret CPUSA membership, as set forth in referenced SSC letter, our New York office was contacted for documents representing original recordings from Bureau informants concerning Levison. As a result our New York office provided the material which is now being delivered and which has served as a basis for statements in various FBI documents that Levison was a secret member of the CPUSA.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

It is noted that referenced SSC letter requested un- excised copies of the February 22, and June 12, 1962, communications from New York which appear to have been the "articulated predicates for the 'cominfil case." The SSC letter did not identify captions of these communications; nor identify any specific "cominfil case." Therefore, we were unable to locate any pertinent documents bearing these dates in our Headquarters files. At a meeting on November 12, 1975, between SSC Staff Member Michael Epstein and representatives of the Intelligence Division of the FBI, it was agreed that the two documents apparently referred to above are New York airtel dated February 12, 1962, captioned "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; SM-C" and New York letter dated August 21, 1962, captioned "Communist Infiltration of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; IS-C."

New York airtel dated February 12, 1962, is being delivered with this memorandum among those documents received from our New York office. Excisions in this document are fewer than those made in a copy previously provided the SSC. A copy bearing no or fewer excisions cannot be provided the SSC for reasons made clear during the oral briefing of Senator Church and selected SSC Staff members on November 5, 1975.

It is noted that New York letter dated August 21, 1962, which is being delivered with this memorandum, is not believed to have been previously provided the SSC.

DAT/2/77/00-

I want you to know how much I appreciated the opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other day about the Martin Luther King, Jr. case. It was most helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge concerning the background of the case, and I can assure you that we will do everything possible to avoid joępardizing any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific items set forth in earlier document requests which would presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion as of various dates in 1962, 1963 and 1964 that Stanley Levison was a "secret member of the Communist Party, USA." Of course in the event that there is no particular document in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to the FBI, I think it would be helpful for you to let us know so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that context. Finally, of course, we still need unexcised copies of the February 22 and June 12, 1962 communications from New York which appear to have been the articulated predicates for the "cominfil" case.

Once again, I want to thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you further on this subject.

Sincerely,

Frank Church

# Memorandum

TO : SAC (100-111180)

FROM : SA JAMES M. KIRBY (414)

SUBJECT: STANLEY LEVISON
IS-C

DATE: 4/17/64

On 4/9/64, (NY 694-S* made the following observations with regard to the CP status of STANLEY LEVISON:

LEVISON has been an important Party member for many years (and never at any time differed with the Party with respect to the Party line. His only difference with the Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion the Party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending Negro rights. In this respect, he has been to the "left" of the Party. LEVISON's differences with the Party are merely "tactical." He has never criticized the Party, except with respect to the Party's handling of the Negro question. The fact that he does not accept domination by the Party with regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all respects. The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly relations with LEVISON as it was in the past.

(It should be noted that LEVISON never has been officially "drummed out" of the Party, nor has anyone ever criticized him for being opposed to the Party's general principles. It further should be noted that according to the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of LEVISON to state that he is officially out of the Party.

LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that he does not continue to be a CP member. It should be noted that it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly repudiate the Party, which he has never done. It should be further noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

TOP SECRET

NY 100-111180

with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact LEVISON. LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that BEN DAVIS was the only CP functionary who had a sufficiently "militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of the Negro movement. The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet have not met should not be construed to mean that LEVISON has refused to confer with DAVIS. AS NY 694-S* understands the situation, DAVIS has been awaiting contact by LEVISON, and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS. Each of these individuals is sufficiently egotistical to expect that the other would make the first move in an effort to establish contact. NY 694-S* believes that probably the reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and that HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting between LEVISON and DAVIS.

NY 694-S* has never obtained any information reflecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to Marxism. Even though his present estrangement from the Party might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member, there is no reason to come to the conclusion that LEVISON is no longer an ideological Communist.

JACK talked to LEM HARRIS yesterday who said he contacted STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial hello which was a change from the past when he was cool.

LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him and would like to see him immediately to which LEVENSON said, "I would like very much to see you but I don't have the time now. I'm leaving and packing for a trip. I will be glad to see you in six weeks."

LEVENSON implied that he was going to Ecuador but LEM doesn't know why. There was no anger shown, and LEVENSON will see LEM when he returns in six weeks.

(On 6/13/63, NY 694-S* furnished the following information to SA ALEXANDER C. BURLINSON:

On 6/12/63, LEMENT HARRIS, CPUSA Reserve Fund functionary, told NY 694-S* that in a recent meeting with STANLEY LEVISON, the latter furnished him the following information:

The LEVISONS, particularly STANLEY, are still MARTIN LUTHER KING's "brain trust"-now more than ever before. This is so despite the fact that at a meeting of STANLEY LEVISON, ROY LEVISON, HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, MARTIN LUTHER KING and "the Attorney General's chief assistant", the Attorney General's assistant, pointing to the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, stated to MARTIN LUTHER KING, "These men are Party members; watch out for them."

MARTIN LUTHER KING did not "bat an eyelash" upon hearing the Assistant Attorney General's remark, and after the latter left the meeting, those in the group smiled at each other. STANLEY LEVISON said to KING, at this time, "I congratulate you on the way you acted regarding his warning. You are a real Marxist-Leninist. This is how a true Marxist-Leninist acts."

Everything that KING does he first discusses with STANLEY LEVISON and he accepts LEVISON's advice wholeheartedly. KING also wholeheartedly accepts the advice of HUNTER PITTS O'DELL as regards matters within the latter's local jurisdiction.

MARTIN LUTHER KING was asked by a group of newspaper reporters whether he takes orders from "the Communists" and also, whether he took "orders from STANLEY LEVISON." KING's response was that he took orders only from God.

By reason of the fact that the LEVISONS feel that the Party has done little, if anything, to assist the fight

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

NY 100-136585

(for civil rights for Negroes, and further, since they feel that the Party, as a result of this "do nothing" attitude, has lost prestige, they will no longer permit the Party to dominate or control their activities in the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement. They are severing themselves, financially and in a disciplinary way, from the Party. The LEVISONS (and O'DELL) are still Party members, (but do not desire to be openly "linked up" with the Party. Although they are "dis-enchanted" with the Party, they are not quitting the Party. With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they will act on their own initiative, and will not accept instructions from the Party.

(LEM HARRIS then advised that the Party, however, still would like to control the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement. BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be "liaison or intermediary" with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. Whether or not the LEVISONS and O'DELL will maintain liaison regarding matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a matter for them to decide. In view of LEVISON's statement with respect to advising MARTIN LUTHER KING independently of Party instructions, it would seem that DAVIS may not have any success in maintaining liaison with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. The LEVISONS and O'DELL are aware of the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignment by the Party.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, according to LEM HARRIS, is referred to by such top Party functionaries as GUS HALL, BEN DAVIS, JIM JACKSON and CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT as a "true, genuine, Marxist-Leninist from the top of his head to the tips of his toes." In the Party, the report is that MARTIN LUTHER KING is following a Marxist-Leninist line.

NY 694-S* advised that he asked LEM HARRIS whether or not, to the latter's knowledge, MARTIN LUTHER KING was a member of the CPUSA. LEM HARRIS replied that he did not know.

(When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address the AFL-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's advice, first obtained approval to do so from A. PHILLIP RANDOLPH, negro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the matter, might have felt that KING's making a speech at the aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.

KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the AFL-CIO convention, and, as a result, received invitations from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel," to address their respective unions. As the outstanding champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful political influence, recognized as such by the higher echelons of the Democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need KING, particularly in the South, where in cities like Atlanta and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of power, and where KING controls the negro vote.

JAMES HOFFA, Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING can influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union, and KING accepted the invitation. Knowing that KING is being deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY, HOFFA requested KING to contact the Attorney General in an effort to influence the latter "to lay off" HOFFA. KING was inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convinced him that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and likely to be a "boomerang," since the Attorney General would never accede to such a request, particularly in the case of HOFFA.

LEVISON had to steer KING away from another politically hazardous situation. Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER, Hollywood movie director, entered into negotiations with a KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture which PREMINGER would direct. Although PREMINGER's offer was "tempting," since it meant "fast, easy money" for KING'S organization, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the offer would lower the latters prestige. After convincing KING of this fact, LEVISON personally telephoned to PREMINGER, telling him that "the deal was off."

(What LEVISON particularly wanted GUS HALL to know
is that "KING is a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied
it (Marxism), believes in it, and agrees with it, but because
of his being a minister of religion, does not dare to espouse
it publicly.")

GUS HALL, according to HARRIS, was "elated" to
receive LEVISON's report on LUTHER KING.

(BA 969-S) advised on 11/22/60, ((BA 134-13A-615) that at a National Negro Commission meeting held on 11/19, 20/60, at CP Headquarters, 23 West 26th Street, NYC, TED BASSETT, a representative of "The Worker", stated that the CP is now in the process of placing members of the Party in key positions in the SCLC. BASSETT continued by saying that a Western Conference of the Christian Leadership is now being formed and a CP member is the leader in this conference.

(NY 694-S*) advised on 5/1/62, that on 4/30/62, (ISADORE WOFSY, CP, USA fund functionary, said that according to LEM HARRIS, he was told by STANLEY LEVISON that the CP, USA had sent "an experienced, professional, secret organizer" to New Orleans, who would assist the MARTIN LUTHER KING group there in its fight for political equality of Negroes. LEVISON allegedly told HARRIS that he personally, and not the Party, was financing this organizer.

(NY 694-S*)advised on 5/2/62, that according to LEM HARRIS, the secret CP organizer, whom the CP, USA had sent to New Orleans, was JOSE HUDSON. HARRIS said that HUDSON would be associated with SERGEANT CAULFIELD in Baton Rouge.

On 7/2/62, (NO 1084-S) advised that SERGEANT CAULFIELD returned to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from Atlanta, Georgia, on 5/31/62. Informant said that CAULFIELD stated that he and JOSE HUDSON met HUNTER O'DELL in Atlanta, O'DELL having flown there from NYC.

NO 1084-S stated that CAULFIELD paid CP dues to O'DELL for several CP members from Louisiana. O'DELL had come to Atlanta regarding organization of the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement. O'DELL thought that if an active

NW 88296 Docld:32989550 Page 22


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

NY 100-149194

MARTIN LUTHER KING movement could be organized in Louisiana, the State Senatorial District where CAULFIELD resides permanently (Lettsworth, Louisiana), CAULFIELD might be furnished as much as $1,000.00 per month to promote this movement. The funds are to come from the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement and the object is to get every eligible Negro to register to vote. CAULFIELD reportedly met MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., while in Atlanta, and discussed with him the voter registration matter in Louisiana.

On 4/27/62, a pretext telephone call was made to UN 6-2000, which is the NYC listing for the Committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING and also the listing for the SCLC at 312 West 125th Street, NYC. The pretext used was that of a person interested in contributing money to the KING committee. The person answering the phone during the conversation identified himself as JACK O'DELL, and furnished the following information:

His office is the Northern Branch of the SCLC. The Committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING, at 312 West 125th Street, was organized as an "ad hoc" committee to assist in the KING defense, when he was the subject of court action. When the reason for this committee's being in existence was removed, it was formally dissolved. The same personalities them formed the Committee to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle, which is now operated at 312 West 125th Street.

O'DELL stated that it would make no difference as to whether a person contributing money makes out checks payable to the Committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING, the SCLC or the Committee to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle, because they are all one and the same.

On 6/1/61, (CG5824-S*) advised that HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, who was (secret member of the National Committee,) SFIO CP, USA, has quit the CP and is officially considered by the CP as being out. However, there are no hard feelings existing between O'DELL and the Party and he is still on good terms with the CP and will work with them.

EXTREME CAUTION MUST BE EXERCISED WITH RESPECT TO DISSEMINATION OF THE INFORMATION HEREIN, SINCE BY ITS NATURE IT TENDS TO IDENTIFY (NY 694+S*), A VALUABLE INFORMANT, AS THE SOURCE THEREOF. UNLESS THIS INFORMATION IS OBTAINED FROM A SOURCE OTHER THAN (NY 694-S*) IT SHOULD NOT BE INCORPORATED, EVEN IN PARAPHRASAD FORM, IN THE INVESTIGATIVE SECTION OF A REPORT.

On 7/23/62, (NY0694-S) stated during a personal contact with GUS HALL, General Secretary of the CP, USA, on that date, HALL advised that HUNTER PITTS O'DELL is SFIO still representing the CP, USA and that he is still on the National Committee of the CP, USA. HALL further remarked that O'DELL is a "brain-trust" for LUTHER KING and is doing an excellent job.

Current investigation in NYC reflects that O'DELL is spending most of his time in the Atlanta area working with the SCLC. He was last reported in the NY area in June, 1962.

On 2/11/62, (NY 1300-S) made available photographs of material maintained in the office of STANLEY LEVISON, 6 East 39th Street, NYC. Included in these photographs were the following:

1. Two checks, both dated 12/19/61, bearing the printed name of the "Southern Christian Leadership Conference", 312 West 125th Street, NY, NY. These checks

are numbered 397 and 399, one in the amount of $251.90
and one in the amount of $150.00, are marked payable
to J. O'DELL, and are signed by STANLEY D. LEVISON.

2. Copy "C" of a Withholding Tax form for
   1961, in the name of JOHN HUNTER O'DELL, 312 West 125th
   Street, NY, NY, Social Security Number 386-14-3707,
   indicating that he was paid $3,050.00 in 1961 by the
   SCLC, 312 West 125th Street, NYC.

(NY 3575-S*) advised on 6/20/62, that STANLEY
LEVISON stated that/in a recent conversation with MARTIN
LUTHER KING, KING said he was thinking of getting another
administrative assistant. LÉVISON stated that in the
past LEVISON had not considered it wise for O'DELL to
take on such a position, but he is the only one who could
do the job and should be considered for it. LEVISON stated
as long as O'DELL did not have the title of Executive
Director, there would not be "as much lightening flashing
around him" O'DELL could be called a coordinator and
still fulfill all the duties of Executive Director.

LEVISON stated, according to (NY 3575-S*) that
KING liked LEVISON'S suggestion with respect to O'DELL
taking this position, because KING felt that O'DELL
must face it sooner or later, stating "that no matter
what a man was, if he could stand up now and say he is
not connected, then as far as I am concerned, he is eligible
to work for me".

(NY 2783-S) advised on 7/11/61, ((NY 134-4268A-378),
that HAZEL GRAY is working again at the SCLC, 312 West 125th
Street, NYC.

On 7/8/61, NY 1212-S stated that it
had come to his attention that CLAUDE
LIGHTFOOT had mentioned that he wanted


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 26

NY 100-149194

to use HAZEL GRAY and her husband,
JOHN GRAY, in the Kings County CP
organization. The informant stated
that LIGHTFOOT highly recommended the
GRAYS.

On 3/10/61, MILTON BIRON, Senior Accountant,
Comtroller's Office, New York City, Bureau of Excise Taxes,
120 West 32nd Street, made available an application for
exemption from the New York City amusement tax, dated
1/23/61, and signed by STANLEY D. LEVISON. The exemption
was requested for a "concert" to be given at Carnegie Hall
on 1/27/61, for one evening performance.

The name of the applicant was given as the "Committee
to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle", 312 West 125th Street,
an unincorporated association. It is stated that the
applicant is a non-profit educational committee which
has registered with the Charities Registration Bureau in
Albany and the Department of Welfare in NYC. It says that it
employs no professional fund raisers and that neither its
officers nor executive directors are paid either salaries
or expenses.

The, "Purposes for which applicant was organized",
are listed as:

"To provide funds for the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference to be used for establishment of
constitutional rights in the South utilizing voting registration
drives, educational meetings, church and synagogue conferences,
sit-in techniques, legal actions etc."

The, "Activities of the Applicant", are listed as:

"Mail solicitations, benefits, meetings, educational
conferences, church collections."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

NY 100-149194

as:
The, "Source and Disposition of Income", is listed as:

"All income less expenses in transmitted to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference or directly paid out to sources indicated by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING is President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference."

A "note" attached to the application stated that the committee was created by resolution as an unincorporated association at an organizing meeting held at the home of HARRY BELAFONTE, 300 West End Avenue, in June, 1960.

The application for exemption from the New York City amusement tax was denied by letter 1/31/61, sent to the Committee to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle, 312 West 125th Street, attention of STANLEY D. LEVISON.

NY has considered the above facts and is of the opinion that a Cominfil investigation of the NY Chapter of the SCLC is warranted, due to the dominant CP influence on the executives of the NY Chapter of the SCLC.

NY will conduct no further investigation without prior Bureau authority.

Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination
Office of the Deputy Attorney General

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mike:

As a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like to make the following requests.

As discussed in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we invite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence informant and source program that could be inserted in the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to present to the Select Committee a complete description of its program and to discuss the issues of particular interest to the Committee members. These include, for example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program, including an assessment of the program's cost and effectiveness, and the distinctions and relationships between the intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when an informant may be used in an organization or group; and 3) the program's command and control system, including the limits that are placed on the activities of informants and the type of information an informant or source is permitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau. In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible legislation in the informant area, such as the imposition of a warrant requirement or additional administrative review. To permit the Select Committee members to study this memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it with FBI representatives during their testimony at the public hearing, we request that the memorandum be submitted by November 24.

Also I am enclosing requests for documents relating to two of the three former FBI informants who are scheduled to testify on December 4. These requests supplement our document request of August 20, 1975 pertaining to informants (Part IV-4).

In addition, we wish to interview and possibly depose the Special Agents who handled the three former informants (Rowe, Hardy and Cook) who are scheduled to testify at the public hearing on December 4. Because of the limited time remaining before the scheduled hearings, we request that the Special Agents be made available for interviews and depositions as soon as possible.

Reference is further made to our memoranda dated
July 17, 1975, and September 25, 1975, which provided background
information and documento pertaining to the SI, ADEX, and RI.

As you are aware, a computerized ADEX listing is pre-
pared monthly at FBIHQ. The SI list was prepared in the same
manner and, as with the former SI, when a new monthly ADEX list
is prepared copies of the old list are destroyed inasmuch as they
are outdated and no longer serve a useful purpose. As you have
been previously advised, names appearing on the former SI and ..
the ADEX have been printed on 5 X 8 cards with a single name
printed on each card. Background information, file numbers, and
type of activity in which the individual is engaged are also
placed on these cards. As you are aware, approximately 15,000 of
these cards, all outdated, have been located as FBIHQ. These
cards include some which contain the identity of individuals who
were maintained on the Priority III level of the former SI and
all ADEX cards deleted or cancelled since its inception.

During the initial period of establishing the ADEX, in
order to obviate the need for conducting massive file reviews,
the ADEX consisted primarily of the identity of those individuals
who had been maintained on the former SI. Although these names
were originally placed in this manner on the new ADEX, as cases
were reviewed under our then existing reporting procedures, each
case was to be reviewed on its own merits utilizing the then
current criteria for ADEX to determine whether continued in-
clusion on the ADEX was warranted. If not, the individual's


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

RE: UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL
OPERATIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

name was deleted. As previously indicated, during 1972 the ADEX
was evaluated and revised. Following this revision, the number
of individuals who were included on the ADEX began to decline
and thus the high number of cancelled cards. In accordance with
Bureau policy, which was instituted during the SI program, these
cancelled cards are maintained at FBIHQ for a period of three
years and there is no way to reconstuct a former SI or ADEX list
for a particular time period by reviewing these cancelled cards.
These cards, however, will roflect the identity of those in-
dividuals who have been placed on the SI and the ADEX for the
period for which these cards were maintained.

Por your request, these outdated SI and ADEX cards
are available for review by appropriate SSC representives
at FBIHQ. In this regard, SSC Staff Members Martha Talley and
John T. Elliff have had access to these cards on October 30,
1975, and November 7, 1975, respectively.

During Mr. Elliff's review of these cards, the names
Shelley Blum, Emanuel James Brisker, Jr., and Gregory Allan
Calvert were selected by fir. Elliff in connection with request
number two of your October 28, 1975, letter. Documents re-
quested regarding these individuals are enclosed.

A review of pertinent files at FBIHQ regarding the SI
and the RI indicates there are no other versions of the former
SI or RI at FBIHQ. Contact was also made with knowledgeable
individuals of our New York City Field Office and it was deter-
mined these programs had been handled in accordance with thon
existing FBIHQ policy and no other versions of these programs
were compiled by that offico.

Materials requested for delivery under item number
four of your October 28, 1975, letter are enclosed. In this re-
gard, it is noted the correct FBIHQ file number for the Emma
Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs is 100-400394 and
the correct file number for the file regarding Communist Infil-
tration of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People is 61-3176. In order to be responsive to your
request, pertinent documents of the typo desired aro being fur-
nished regarding these organizations from these files.

Reference is made to my letter dated July 1, 1975, which enclosed a memorandum of the same date relating to a request for documentary materials made by the Senate Select Committee (SSC) under the date of May 14, 1975.

The referenced memorandum, on page 1, paragraph 4, refers to a briefing by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to the National Security Council, presided over by the President, on November 6, 1958. A further review of our records has determined this briefing by Mr. Hoover was actually furnished to the President and members of his Cabinet on November 6, 1958. Although it is likely members of the National Security Council were present, technically it was a briefing of the President and his Cabinet.

Attached for your approval and forwarding to the Committee is the original of a memorandum correcting this technical error and requesting the Committee appropriately change its records.

A copy of the memorandum is provided for your records.

Reference is made to memorandum dated July 1, 1975, which responded to a SSC request under the date of May 14, 1975, for documents relating to this Bureau's former Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros).

Page 1, paragraph 4, of referenced memorandum refers to a briefing by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to the National Security Council, presided over by the President, November 6, 1958. Enclosed with the memorandum was a document with a cover page alluding to this briefing of the National Security Council.

A current review of the records of this Bureau has determined the briefing by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover on November 6, 1958, was actually furnished to the President and members of his Cabinet. Although it may be presumed that some members of the Cabinet were also members of the National Security Council, it is requested you correct your records to more accurately indicate the true nature of the briefing.

This is also to confirm information orally furnished by Supervisor David Ryan of the FBI to SSC staff member Barbara Banoff on November 13, 1975, at SSC offices. At that time,

Reference is made to a memorandum dated 11/12/75 from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams, Deputy Associate Director, in which a recommendation was made that the Intelligence Division determine whether there is a memorandum describing a briefing of former Attorney General Ramsey Clark by Mr. Cartha DeLoach, former Assistant to the Director, concerning the Counterintelligence Program.

Mr. DeLoach, during an interview under oath by staff members of the Senate Select Committee on 11/11/75, advised that he had briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the Counterintelligence Program and, when asked whether he had written a memorandum regarding that briefing, advised that he could not specifically recall whether a memorandum was prepared. During the interview by Committee staff members, they advised Mr. DeLoach that they had asked for such documentation from the Bureau, but a memorandum indicating Mr. DeLoach had briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the Counterintelligence Program was not received among the documents furnished by the Bureau

This will advise that additional review of Bureau files by personnel of the Analytical Research Unit has failed to disclose any memorandum which describes a briefing of Clark by Mr. DeLoach regarding the Counterintelligence Program.

In the last paragraph on page 2 of this document, the word "key" in line 3 should be excised.

In the enclosure to former Director Hoover's letter to the Honorable Robert F. Kennedy dated January 10, 1961, on page 2 the paragraph which has already been partially excised and which begins "A CP leader..." and which ends "... of the world" should be excised in its entirety.

On September 10, 1975, Mr. David Aaron, an investigator for SSC was briefed at FBI Headquarters (FBIH) in preparation for his planned visit to Brasilia, Brazil, on September 22, 1975, and Buenos Aires, Argentina, on September 25, 1975, in connection with the Committee's inquiry into U. S. intelligence activities. Mr. Aaron was briefed on the overall role and mission of the FBI's Legal Attaches (Legats), and specifically on the activities and functions of the Legats at Brasilia and Buenos Aires. He was advised that Legat, Brasilia, utilized two confidential sources in order to facilitate the prompt coverage of leads in Brazil. He was also told that Legat, Mexico City, and Legat, Brasilia, were the only Legat offices that utilized paid confidential sources.

Legat, Buenos Aires, informed FBIHQ that the U. S. Embassy at Buenos Aires received instructions, classified "Secret," from the U. S. Department of State with regard to the visit of David Aaron, a former U. S. Department of State Foreign Service Officer, and William Truchart, a former U. S. Ambassador, to the U. S. Embassies at Brasilia, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo and the U. S. Consul General in Rio de Janeiro. The

Department of State advised that the primary objective of the visitors was to discuss with the Ambassador and members of his staff the relationships and exercise of authority by the Ambassador of the intelligence activities in the field. The Department of State further advised that operational details, sources and methods were not construed to be legitimate avenues of inquiry by the SSC Staff Members.

Legat, Brasilia, was interviewed on September 22, 1975, by Messrs. Aaron and Truehart, with Aaron being dominant in the interviewing process. The interview was directed mainly toward attempts to elicit examples whereby Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had withheld dissemination of information of interest to other agencies. Inquiries were made concerning CIA activities inside and outside the Embassy. Specific questions were placed with Legat to ascertain if the FBI was involved in Soviet Embassy "walk-ins" as well as recruitment of double agents and CIA-oriented operations. Discussion concerning Legat's role and functions in Brasilia appeared to be routine, with few, if any, pointed questions directed at FBI operations overseas, The subject of two paid confidential sources in Brasilia was briefly discussed and both SSC investigators appeared understanding and in agreement with the necessity of each confidential source to serve FBI's and U. S. Government's best interests in Brazil. The question seemingly bearing the most weight during the interview concerned possible unauthorized activities of CIA and its lack of cooperation and coordination with FBI and the Defense Attache's Office. The duration of the intervioW was approximately forty-five minutes.(S)

Legat, Buenos Aires, was interviewed by the two SSC Staff Members on September 26, 1975. Again Aaron played the dominant role during interview. He commenced

the interview by stating that the operations of Legats,
Brasilia, and Buenos Aires, were not the type of Legat
operations he desired to review, indicating that
Mexico City Legat's operations were more of the type of
interest to them. Aaron asked pointed questions
concerning the mechanics of Legat reporting on
intelligence information developed locally to FBIH) and
the local coordination of this information with the
Embassy components. Aaron requested the Legat provide
him with the general nature of intelligence developed
and reported by the Legat to the Embassy and FBIHQ. He
was told that generally international and local terrorism
were the prime topics of Legat reporting. Inquiry was
also made into the reason for FBI expansion of foreign
liaison activities in 1970. He was told that the Legat
was not personally aware of any special reason other than
that the FBI liaison operations required additional
personnel and Aaron was referred to FBILLQ for any
additional information in this regard. Legat was asked
whether the CIA Station had ever requested Legat to secure
data from FBI computer banks on Argentine residents of
CIA interest who had previously resided in the U. S.
Legat's reply was in the negative. Other questions mainly
dealt with cooperation and coordination activities between
the FDI and the CIA at the Embassy. Inquiry was also undo
into the relationship of the Drug Enforcement Agency and
FBI overseas. The interview lasted approximately thirty-
five minutes.

Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, Mr. Aaron was
suffering from an intestinal problem and remained in his
Duenos Aires hotel on September 25, 1075. The Chargo D'
Affaires hosted a small luncheon for forner Ambassador
Truchart on that date which Legat, Duenos Aires, attended.
Truchart was very open regarding the operations of the SSC

and stated that he felt the Committee had lost its perspective and that ho believed that various Senators were engaging in a game of "one-upmanship" in revealing so-called sensational disclosures of CIA activities. Truchart stated he personally felt that the original purpose of the Committee to afford an objective review of U. S. intelligence operations had been lost.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 10/26/2023

Memorandum advises concerning proposed SSC hearing on FBI foreign counterintelligence (CI) matters.

On 10/30/75 Mr. John Elliff, SSC Staff Member, met with Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Intelligence Division (INTD). Also present were Section Chiefs W. A. Branigan (CI-1) and W. O. Cregar (CI-2) and Acting Section Chief F. J. Cassidy (IS-3) and Unit Chief E. W. Larson, Training Unit (IS-3). Mr. Elliff advised that the Committee proposed to have an executive session tentatively scheduled for the morning of Friday, 11/14/75, which would deal with foreign CI operations. In addition to representatives from the FBI they envisioned also having present representatives from CIA and the United States military intelligence services. He stated that the session would be scheduled for approximately 2 and one-half hours.

During the conference the following three themes were outlined by Mr. Elliff as the probable areas of discussion:

1.  Changes in CI operations during recent years

Items discussed as probably worthy of attention were physical surveillances, the walk-in operations, defection (recruitment-in-place), CI training programs. Also suggested as a prime topic was the future projections concerning administration of foreign CI operations in the United States, i.e., new division for CI work within FBI; separate CI service; or other modifications.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: U. S. Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence Activities (SSC)

## Counter-subversion

In this category Mr. Elliff indicated a particular interest in foreign influence in domestic groups and the assessment of danger/risk in investigations undertaken to detect such influence. He brought up the disclosures of surveillances by CIA of Americans abroad at the request of the FBI. He also indicated an interest in borderline cases, such as those in which domestic counter-subversion investigations develop a CI aspect, and was particularly interested in the policies and coordinating mechanisms affecting such instances.

## Positive intelligence collection

In this category Mr. Elliff was interested in the responsibility for collection of positive intelligence within the United States and the apparent gap which existed in this field. He was also interested in situations under which the FBI might target friendly foreign intelligence services in the United States for CI attention.

Considerable discussion was held during the conference during which INTD representatives set forth the FBI's position and experience in the many areas noted. They are being set forth here to illustrate the probable scope and nature of the executive session which is being planned. Further discussions will be held with the SSC staff to clarify these matters and a firmer agenda for the proposed 11/14/75 hearing will be developed.

With respect to the proposed plan to include representatives of CIA and the military intelligence services along with the FBI in the proposed session of 2 and one half hours, it was pointed out to Mr. Elliff that this would not appear to be a very productive procedure. The CI perspectives and responsibilities of CIA and the military services are much more narrow and generally in a completely different context than the CI perspectives and responsibilities of the FBI, These differences, particularly in the short

time allotted, appear to represent a disadvantage to all
parties concerned, including the Committee. It was pointed
out that the FBI, in particular, would have considerable
difficulty in presenting a comprehensive and valid picture
of its own CI operations under the conditions imposed by
such a session. Mr. Elliff, after considering these
objections, stated that he could understand the FBI
position but was somewhat doubtful considering the pressures
under which the Committee was operating that he would be
able to alter this situation.

BUDED 1/30/76

Enclosed is a self-explanatory letter from the Attorney General dated 1/12/76.

Joseph Kraft, the subject of the inquiry, is the well-known newspaper columnist and a Washington, D. C. resident. During the past year, information contained in FBI Headquarters files relating to Kraft has been furnished to the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC) pursuant to SSC requests. Kraft and his attorneys have re- viewed the material furnished to the SSC regarding him in accordance with an agreement between Kraft and the Attorney General, referred to in paragraph one of the enclosure. As noted in the enclosure, Kraft, as a result of a review of information regarding the burglary of his residence on 9/3/69, raised certain questions.

WFO should furnish FBIHQ with Xeroxes of all serials in its files which relate to the 9/3/69 burglary except WFO airtel and letter to the Bureau dated 9/4/69 and 10/17/69, respectively, captioned "UNSUB; Burglary of residence of Joseph Kraft, 3021 N. Street N. W., Washington, D. C., Loss of silverware, 9/3/69 in excess of $5,000.00 ITSP (00:WFO)" file number 87-17564. This material should of course include any-serials which would indicate the manner in which the burglary was reported to WFO and how the conversation about the burglary took place.

Re: Senstudy 75

In addition to the review of all files pertinent to
this inquiry, WFO should review the newspaper morgues of daily
newspapers published in Washington, D. C., at such time for
articles concerning the burglary and which may shed some
additional light on this matter.

This matter must be given expeditious attention
and results submitted by airtel to reach Bureau by
c.o.b. 1/30/76.

NOTE:

Bureau memorandum dated July 23, 1973, referred
to in enclosure and to which Kraft raised a question
sets forth the information that Kraft advised WFO on
9/4/69 of the burglary of his residence 9/3/69. Kraft
now has no recollection of having spoken to the FBI
about the burglary. Pertinent FBIHQ main case files
on Kraft (62-115682, 65-75629, 87-107157 and 105-68548)
were reviewed by Supervisor T. E. Burns in connection
with this inquiry. Such review failed to develop
required information. Review by WFO as directed within
should develop appropriate information necessary to
resolve this matter.

# UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

Memorandum

TO : Clarence Kelley, Director
FBI

FROM : Edward H. Levi
Attorney General

SUBJECT: Joseph Kraft burglary

DATE: January 12, 1976

Among the documents from Federal Bureau of Investigation files provided to my office under a cover memorandum dated October 7, 1975, there was a memorandum dated July 18, 1973 and titled "Joseph Kraft," This document, along with the others, was provided to Mr. Kraft's attorneys pursuant to the agreement of August 5, 1975, for review before the department furnished it to the Senate Select Committee.

When Mr. Kraft and his attorneys reviewed the July 18, 1973, document they raised a question about a reference on page two of the document which stated:

"On September 4, 1969, Joseph Kraft advised the Washington Field Office of the FBI that he left his home (3021 N Street, N. W., Washington D. C.) at approximately 9:20 P.M. on September 3, 1969, to visit with former Governor Averell Harriman who resided a few doors from the Kraft "residence. At approximately 9:45 P.M. Mrs. Kraft, who was in the second floor bedroom of the residence, came down the stairs and found the door open.

"Subsequently, it was discovered by Mr. and Mrs. Kraft several items of sterling silver were missing from the dining room and the pantry which items, according to the Krafts, had an estimated value of approximately $10,000.

"A crime scene search and processing of the crime scene by the Metropolitan Police Department produced negative results. No forcible entry was noted and Mr. Kraft advised investigative officers of the Metropolitan Police Department that he had probably left the front door ajar when he departed the residence.

Buy U.S. Savings Bonds Regularly on the Payroll Savings Plan


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

"On the morning of September 4, 1969, the Metropolitan Police Department was advised by the Washington National Airport Police that some silverware had been found near one of the entrances to the terminal at the Washington National Airport. The silverware was recovered by the Metropolitan Police Department and processed for latent fingerprints without success and the items were returned to Mrs. Kraft upon her identification of the silverware. No suspects were developed by either the FBI or the Metropolitan Police Department in the investigation of the matter."

Mr. Kraft does not recall having spoken to the FBI about the burglary. Documents provided more recently to Mr. Kraft pursuant to the August 5, 1975, agreement do not shed any light on this question.

The incident is curious in that the only reference to it comes in the memorandum of July 18, 1973, discussing a press report about the activities of John D. Erlichman. Could you have someone look into this matter for me? The obvious questions are: What other documents in FBI files say about the September 3, 1969, burglary? What files of the Bureau or its Washington field office indicate about how the conversation about the burglary took place?

SUBJECT: DEMCON

As the Bureau is aware, I am gravely concerned over the potential for serious violence occurring in Chicago during the period of the Democratic Convention, which commences August 26, 1968 and the days immediately preceding this convention. Had the convention occurred within 30 days after the President made his announcement that he was not going to run for reelection and after the Viet Nam peace talks started in Paris, I feel that we might not have had serious violence as these two occurrences took much of the steam out of many of the organizations comprising the "New Left". Their direction at that time was primarily against President JOHNSON and against Viet Nam and much of the steam went out of their programs following these two announcements.

It is our observation, however, that these "New Left" organizations have now had time to redirect their programs and are now concentrating primarily on demonstrations and activities against Vice President HUMPHREY, characterized by them as the "Dump Humphrey Campaign". The fact that the war still continues in Viet Nam, has again given emphasis to the organizations which exist on the basic theme of anti- Viet Nam. I am thinking particularly of such organizations as the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet Nam, Students for Democratic Society, Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet Nam and the Youth International Party (Yippies).

# Memorandum

TO: DIRECTOR, FBI (157-8589)

FROM: SAC, CHICAGO (100-44963)

SUBJECT: DEMCON

DATE: 8/23/68

On August 12, 1968, USA THOMAS A. FORAN contacted SAC, Chicago, advising that WARREN CHRISTOPHER, Deputy U.S. Attorney General, desired to meet with the SAC, Chicago.

As a result of the above request, SAC, Chicago, and Supervisor RICHARD L. STRAIN met briefly with Mr. WARREN CHRISTOPHER and Mr. WES POMEROY of the U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C., in the presence of USA FORAN in his offices.

Mr. CHRISTOPHER was most congenial and expressed his high regard for the FBI and asked for a current evaluation of activities in the Chicago area which could possibly affect the Democratic National Convention (DNC) being held the last week of August, 1968. Mr. CHRISTOPHER was advised that all information has been previously furnished to him by letterhead memoranda and was in his possession and he was assured all information coming to our attention would be immediately furnished to the Department and to the USA in Chicago. A brief discussion of current trends followed relative to current intelligence regarding the activities of anti-war and Negro militant organizations which have proposed disruptive tactics at the DNC.

At one point in the discussion mention was made of the fact that the Youth International Party, aka / Yippies, was currently holding talks with the city administration in an effort to obtain necessary park permits to have their followers live and sleep in one of the Chicago area parks during the week of the convention and hold a "happening" which the Yippies referred to as the "Festival of Life." During this discussion USA FORAN confidentially advised that when he had received the FBI's notification of the anticipated plans on the part of the Yippies, he had contacted certain city officials known to him and attempted to persuade them against the issuance of such a permit in view of the known moral conduct of such groups. USA FORAN advised he had been assured that such permits would not be granted. He stated these 'permits have as yet not been granted and that his sources have indicated no serious consideration has been given to the request by responsible Chicago city officials.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 84

CG 100-44963

For the Bureau's information, Sgt. JOSEPH GRUBISIC,
Intelligence Section, Chicago PD, advised previously that he
had learned from DAVID STAHL of the Mayor's Office, Chicago,
that they had received a telephone call, a couple of days ago,
from one WES POMEROY of the U.S. Attorney General's Office,
to the effect that the Attorney General wanted the Chicago
city officials to give every consideration to the granting
of the permits requested by the Yippies.

Sgt. GRUBISIC was unable to comment on the feeling
of the city administration to this request but was of the
opinion that such permits would not be granted as requested.
Sgt. GRUBISIC based his opinion on the fact that four repre-
sentatives of the Yippies, from New York City, had gone to
the office of the Deputy Superintendent of the Chicago PD and
had requested immunity from arrest for all Yippies during the
convention for crimes around the possession of narcotics. The
Yippies stated that any arrest would cause the Yippie community
to cause large scale riots, and the blame of any riots resulting
from such arrests would fall on the Chicago PD.

These representatives of the Yippies were advised
in no uncertain terms that the laws of the City of Chicago
would be strictly enforced fairly on all persons and that no
one would be granted any immunity during this period.

The Bureau's attention is invited to the August 9,
1968, issue of the "Daily World," daily publication of the
Communist Party, USA (CP), wherein an article appeared on page
one captioned "Rallies Will Ring Demo Convention" written by
CARYL/DAVIAU, current member, CP of Illinois, in which the
reporter indicates that the National Mobilization Committee
to End the War in Vietnam, which is working around the clock to
mobilize demonstrations against the convention, has petitioned
the Justice Department to investigate the Chicago Police to
determine if there is any conspiracy to deprive "us" of our
full civil liberties.

Chicago will continue to follow these matters
closely and immediately advise the Bureau, and continue to
disseminate all information of intelligence collected to
interested agencies.

No recommendation is being made nor is Chicago
involving itself in any plans affecting the issuance of the
abovementioned park permit.

ENCLOSURE

CG 100-44963

As the Bureau is aware, Chicago is in receipt of information from confidential sources indicating a potential for demonstration arising out of the "New Left" calling for direct confrontation with the Chicago Police Department as a diversionary tactic for a "crash-in" at the convention site. Sources have also reported independent action on the part of individuals to cause some form of "sabotage" activity inside the convention itself. Information received from confidential informants in other divisions indicates attempts on the part of dissident young people not organizationally affiliated with the "New Left", to hire 50 buses out of New York to bring demonstrators to Chicago and a caravan of militant Latin Americans to come from the Miami, Florida area to Chicago for the specific purpose of disrupting the Democratic National Convention.

The Chicago area activists in the Youth International Party are currently planning a "Festival of Lights" in one of the parks on Chicago's lakefront during the period of the Democratic National Convention. This "Festival of Lights" characterized by Chicago area Yippie leadership as being peaceful to show America that there is an alternative to the "festival of death", or the Democratic National Convention. However, sources report that there are elements within the Youth Inter- national Party which are calling for direct confrontation with the Chicago Police Department during the "Festival of Lights".

There is a very definite indication that more and more plans are being made by these groups to cause violence and trouble and undoubtedly this will increase even more as we approach the time of the convention. I strongly feel that we must use every possible means at our command to insure that the Director, the President of the United States and other pertinent officials are furnished every possible piece of intelligence information which we can gather from any source.

I am specifically asking for the services of two Special Agents who proved during their assignment in Chicago that they are expecially well qualified to handle informants and make contacts in the "New Left" area. They proved during their assignments in Chicago that they have the knowhow, the interest, the dedication and the personality to be highly successful in

this area. I would like to utilize them specifically to work cases in the "New Left" area, make contacts and would also request authority where necessary to utilize them in undercover work under my personal supervision and guidance. They would be specifically assigned fulltime to solicit information from the leadership of the "New Left" concerning their plans for demonstrations, confrontations and disruptions of the Democratic Convention and matters relating thereto.

I am, therefore, urgently requesting that SA WILLIAM J. DILLON, III, presently assigned to Los Angeles and SA WAYNE F. MANIS, under transer to Anniston, Alabama Resident Agency, be assigned on a temporary basis in Chicago for the above stated purpose from August 15, 1968 through August 31, 1968. Both men, while young in years in the Bureau, demonstrated outstanding judgment and I am convinced that their assignments, as recommended above, would prove to be most beneficial in carrying out our responsibilities in connection with the Democratic Convention.

DATE: 8/14/68

FROM SAC, CHICAGO (100-44963)

SUBJECT: DEMCON

This will confirm telephonic contact between SAC, Chicago, and Assistant Director N. P. CALLAHAN on August 13, 1968.

As the Bureau is aware, the Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago from August 26 - 28, 1968. Voluminous information is being received from all offices which requires immediate handling. In addition, tension is growing in the ghetto areas of Chicago particularly the west side, the south side and the near north side. Also, tension has been growing i: such Chicago suburban areas as Harvey, Chicago Heights, East Chicago Heights and Maywood. Incidents are occurring every night and throughout the night requiring immediate preparation of teletypes, letterhead memoranda and other communications. It is, therefore, necessary as approved by Mr. CALLAHAN for one and on some shifts two stenographers to be on duty from 4:00 PM to midnight and from midnight to 8:00 AM, seven days a week through August 30, 1968. These stenographers have been selected on a purely voluntary basis. The authority for these special shifts will be considered to expire close of business August 30, 1968, and thereafter we will revert back to the regularly approved stenographic shifts.

FROM: SAC M. W. JOHNSON

SUBJECT: DEMCON

At 9:15 AM today, the Director telephonically contacted me to advise that he had just been in touch with the Vice President of the United States and had just gotten off the phone with the Vice President's Executive Assistant, Mr. WILLIAM CONNELL. Mr. HOOVER stated that the Vice President has requested that we furnish the same type of service in connection with the Democratic National Convention in Chicago as was furnished to the President during the Atlantic City Convention four years ago. This, of course, refers to intelligence information which will be of value to the Vice President and specifically relates to the possibility of demonstrations, violence and related matters. Mr. HOOVER stated that he had advised the Vice President and Mr. CONNELL that this service would be performed and that Mr. CONNELL should contact me for the necessary arrangements.

Mr. HOOVER advised me that Mr. CONNELL is presently in New York and it is not known when he will arrive in Chicago. I advised Mr. HOOVER that his instructions would be followed, that we had set up appropriate arrangements so that we would be in a position to furnish valuable intelligence and that upon Mr. CONNELL'S arrival in Chicago, I would immediately contact him and perfect the necessary arrangements.

My secretary has been instructed to notify all switchboard operators, complaint agents and supervisors that any call from Mr. CONNELL should be immediately referred to me when I am in the office or if I am not in the office to determine where I can contact Mr. CONNELL immediately.

The following is a summary of a five page report, dated `/19/74, furnished by Mary Jo Cook, former FBI informant.

A meeting of the National Defense Committee of the VVAW/WSO was held on 6/7-9/74 at St. Louis, Missouri. Eleven identified individuals attended.

The purpose was to ascertain the feasibility of setting up a National Defense Committee which would be operational throughout the United States. As concerns VVAW/WSO, the meeting sought to advise members that the organization's Defense Committee will take steps to secure the release or acquittals of any members arrested.

A representative from the National Collective in Chicago talked about the Gainesville 8 in a derogatory manner, implying the Government did not try the Gainesville 8 for purely political reasons, but that the leader and some others planned some kind of illegal activity. He also said if there had been no Agent provocateur there would never have been a trial and that the National Collective would not have permitted violent activity. 17 items were handed out, a large portion of which were reprints from national and "movement" publications covering such topics as how to avoid being questioned by the FBI. One of these, on jury selection, is attached.

NW 88296 Docld:32989550 Page 100


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 101

# Jury Selection

The jury element is the people's component in the existing system of criminal justice; it is only quasi-organized and partially managed. The use of systematic jury selection can be an important tool in the practice of people's law, but at present it is being developed and used selectively as a successful foil in cases of overt political attack. The minimal program in jury selection defense work is to secure a group of twelve people who will take their function as jurors seriously and assume that the defendants are innocent until proven guilty. The maximal program is to secure a jury which will acquit the defendants.

Since 1970, serious inroads have been made on the jury system: proposed abolition of 12 - person juries, non-unanimous verdicts, abolition of *voir dire* of prospective jurors by lawyers, disciplining of 'disruptive' lawyers and other reforms! to 'speed up' decision-making. Juries are under attack by the narrow, elite group who seek to rule this country only because this vehicle of the people's power cannot be relied upon to make political prisoners of us all.

## Challenging Jury Composition

18 U.S.C. Sec. 1861 is a federal statute which places an obligation on the courts to assure the right to a jury selected at random from a fair cross-section of the community. Data, gathered from observing juries, which suggests an imbalance can be used as grounds for access to jury selection records. Through sample of the qualification cards comprising the voter Jury Wheel, a demography (the study of the characteristics of the population) of the voter registration list can be determined.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 102

These findings, pared with consus dezogy, will reveal areas of underrepresentation. In the case of the Attica Fair Jury Project, a systematic arclysis of jury selection records obtained by court order revealed that third world people are underrepresented by 34.35, women by 68, and people botween the ages 21-29 by 83.6%. This study yielded concrete evidence that the Erie County jury srotem is illegal and unconstitutional, and the system has been challenged on those grounds.

There are four practical advantages to be gained from a jury challenge even if it does not result in the inmediate modification of the composition of the master jury wheel which might provide a larger proportion of people from the less authoritaric sectors of the population.

1. pursuing a challengo can gain tino for the defense.
2. exaination of the jury questioncise and the jury process raises the defenses's consciousness of what the problems are likely to be in jury selection.
3. a challenge introduces some accountability to the jury prccess and may change the behavior of the jury clerk and/or judge.
4. a verdict for conviction can be overturned and a new trial obtained on the basis of an objection to jury composition and selection, if a later court upholds the jury challenge.

Ponographic model of jury selection.

There are three separate elements to the demographic Podol of jury selection.

1. a survey must be taken of a representative cross-section of "pulation that may be called for jury permice; tide to root ally done by telephonp.

myoton for rating prospective jurors on the basis of voir


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 103

dire must be established.

3.  a not-work of people must be set up to gather outside third-party information to corroborate the results of the survey and voir dire.

The demographic-attitudinal survey is used to obtain precise information on the range of attitudinal patterns prevalent in a given judicial district. At a minimum, the following must be covered: demographic information, (age, sex, race, education, etc.) organizational affiliations, media contact, knowledge of the case, political ideology and attitudes toward core American values, social change, divergent life styles and alternative institutions, and toward the type of defendants and the charges specific to the case. A random sample of any of three groups will give the defense committee the demographic information necessary: 1) those who have already been called for jury duty, 2) the voter registration list, or 3) 1% of a cross-section of the population.

The voir dire ratings are constructed by combining observations of behavior and attitudes expressed during the voir dire. This procedure is still being developed but there seems to be a high correlation between ratings of individual authoritarianism and types composed of demographic variables. For example, in the Rap Brown case, the attitudinal study pin-pointed the most "dangerous" defense juror as a male manager, engineer, government employee, or real estate broker, into the local establishment, Methodist or over 45, and who lived in a rural area or small,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

quiet town. His dependent authoritarianism rating was very high-just as you would expect from a juror whose values embraced authority, patriotism, conformity, government right or wrong, etc. The authoritarianism ratings can further be used as a reference point to make sense of the body language, costume and verbal ratings. These ratings become even more essential when faced with a limited voir dire.

Schulman stresses that voir dire ratings should be done collectively. Defendants and trial lawyers should participate, but past trials have shown them to have definite problems with objective judgments in this area.

A core of people from a cross-section of the community should be established to obtain information about the people on the venire list so that any inconsistencies between the voir dire ratings and the demographic ratings can be resolved. This can be done by asking 10 people to contact 3 friends, who in turn will contact 3 friends, who in turn etc. This should be done with a clear presentation of the kind of information needed and a clear understanding of what constitutes jury tampering.

The following is a summary of a two-page report dated 7/31/74 furnished by Mary Jo Cook, a former FBI informant.

The report covers the following matters:

It appears as if the Revolutionary Union is making its move and focusing on the upcoming National Conference, An issue of "Winter Soldier" was received and its editorial was an RU editorial.

The VVAW/WSO newsletter arrived from the National Office and listed three possible directions VVAW/WSO can take:

1) Anti-imperialist veteran's organization with the supporters.

2) A veteran's organization for veteran's only.

3) A mass anti-imperialist organization with no base.

A discussion concerning the National Office supporting or becoming aligned with the RU.

# SUMMARY OF INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY
GARY THOMAS ROWE WHO WAS AN INFORMANT
OF THE FBI FROM MAY, 1960, UNTIL JANUARY, 1966.

I. INFORMANT REPORTS SUBMITTED BY GARY THOMAS ROWE

1. On 5/14/61 Rowe advised that the burning of a bus
   and the beating of individuals at a bus depot in
   Alabama during May, 1961, was instituted by a local
   Ku Klux Klan unit.

2. On 5/17/61 Rowe stated that the Klan would try
   to intercept a bus which was due to arrive in
   Birmingham, Alabama, at 11 P.M. on 5/17/61. He
   further stated that Klansmen should intercept
   the bus on the highway and give all persons present,
   whether black or white, an opportunity to get off.
   They would be allowed to enter privately owned
   automobiles and have a safe journey to the nearest
   town. Rowe was advised by another Klansman that
   those who refused to leave the bus would be beaten.

3. On June 4, 1962, Rowe furnished copies of five
   documents expected to be distributed by Klansmen
   in order to discourage voters from voting for
   certain candidates who allegedly supported
   various civil rights groups.

4. During March, 1962, Rowe furnished information
   regarding a local Klan meeting at which 23


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

Klansmen were present. The meeting centered around a Klansman's plan to run for a high state office. Also discussed was another candidate for this office.

5. During July, 1962, Rowe advised that a Klansman told a select group of other Klansmen that "it looks as if the Negroes should be stopped now."

This group of Klansmen was told that police officials had promised them protection and that a high state official would pardon them if arrested. This Klansman further advised that if a particular "militant Negro Integrationist" would appear at a certain restaurant with other Negroes he should be attacked and killed. Instructions were also issued by this Klansman that if this "militant Negro Integrationist" did not appear at this restaurant but sent other Negroes to stago a sit-in, then there would be no killing. He stated that these Negroes should be beaten with chains and clubs instead.

6. During October, 1964, Rowe reported on Klan discussions regarding a plan to handle alleged "race mixing" at a local night club. Also discussed was a plan by Klansmon to bomb this night club.

## BUREAU HANDLING OF INFORMANT

On 4/17/64, the Bureau advised SAC, Birmingham, to immediately instruct Rowe to withdraw from his position as squad leader of an "action squad." SAC, Birmingham, was further advised that in the event Rove does not desire to withdraw from this leadership position, he should be discontinued as an informant.

On 4/18/64, Rowe was advised by the Birmingham Office that he must remove himself as a squad leader of an "action squad."

On 5/4/64, the Pureau advised SAC, Birmingham, that "in those cases whore you have an informant who is a member of a violent squad...you should insure that the informant understands he is not to direct, lead, or instigate any acts of violence." It was also pointed out that informant should be instructed to avoid participation in any act of violence.

## KLAN VIOLENCE AT THE BIRMINGHAM BUS DEPOT 5/14/61

By letter from the Bureau to 23 field offices, it was stated that a civil rights organization in-tended to make a nonviolent attempt to complete integration of bus service and related public accommodations in the South during the month of May.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 111

By internal Bureau remorandum dated 5/13/61, it was noted that information from a confidential informant (Rowe) was received concerning the possibility that local authorities may allow disturbances to generate against above civil rights group on 5/14/61, when they were due to arrive in Birmingham, Alabama. This memorandum shows that appropriate local law enforcement authorities were advised of the potential for violence in Birmingham prior to 5/14/61.

ReBuairtel to Birmingham 5/21/65 and SFairtel to Director 5/22/65 captioned ("EH 248-R.)

ReSFairtel furnished information concerning outstanding indebtedness of Gary Thomas Rowe, Jr. The financial obligations he has incurred with the banking institutions and with the State of Alabama regarding unpaid sales tax appear to be dormant debts which would not necessarily have to be paid on a current basis as part of his living expenses. Following completion of the trials in this case, consideration will be given by the Dureau to a recommendation of a lump-sum payment which informant might use to help liquidate these obligations.

With reference to the sums owed the power, gas, Telephone and realty companies, it is not clear whether these are current monthly expenses to the informant or rather dormant bills. Advise Bureau if these are precent expenses to the informant and, if not paid or services discontinued, what parties would be affected.

ReSFairtel reflects informant has advised that the indebtedness with the Boothby Realty Company is accumulating day by day for rent of a residence going back to 2/1/65. The Bureau desires to know the purpose of informant maintaining this residence (presumably in Birmingham) and of informant's...

RE: EUGENE THOMAS, ET AL;

intentions to continue to maintain this residence inasmuch
as both he and his ex-wife are residing elsewhere.

Informant's ex-wife has obtained employment at a
salary of approximately $228 per month. She has fixed
obligations that will amount to approximately $424 a month
and feels she could better meet her obligations if she were
receiving her alimony payments. Mrs. Rowe has stated she
is to receive alimony of $115 a month and that her ex-husband
is in arrears for a total of $690. The Bureau desires to
know what informant's thoughts are as to meeting this
obligation to his ex-wife. Also advise if informant considers
these payments as necessary monthly obligations that he would
meet under normal circumstances.

The Birmingham Office is to give this your immediate
attention and promptly advise the Bureau.

NOTE:

The Birmingham Office has pointed out that Rowe has
performed an invaluable service to the Bureau and has saved an
untold amount of man power and various expenses in connection
with the shooting of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo. Informant has been
in protective custody of the Bureau since 4/1/65 and not had
opportunity to be gainfully employed to meet various obligations.
The Birmingham Office has recommended that the Bureau pay
informant's outstanding bills in order to continue the excellent
relationship developed. We are presently paying him $16 per day
subsistence in lieu of expenses which figure was decided upon
after discussion with the Department. It is not desired to make
a large payment at this time which could be construed as a payment
to Rowe for his testimony in the up-coming trials. Birmingham
previously requested to submit a detailed accounting of Rowe's
debts showing their basis, when contracted and schedule of
payments. The information received from the field needs to be
further clarified after which time this matter will be discussed
with the Department and its views obtained as to whether or not
payment of these debts would be judicious at this time.

The Birmingham Office has advised that our informant
Gary Thomas Rowe has current outstanding debts in the Birmingham,
Alabama, area totaling $2350.03, and the SAC, Birmingham
recommends that these debts be paid by the Bureau in full.

Birmingham points out that Rowe has performed
invaluable service to the Bureau in connection with the case
involving the shooting of Mrs. Viola Liuzzo, and his services
have saved the Bureau an untold amount of Agent manpower and
various expenses connected with an extended major investigation.
They point out that informant has been in protective custody
of the Bureau since 4-1-65, and as such, has not had an
opportunity to be gainfully employed in order to meet various
financial obligations that he has been meeting in the past.
Birmingham points out that it is absolutely imperative to insure
the possible success of the next trial tentatively scheduled
for September, 1965, that the excellent relationship developed
with Rowe must be retained, and to accomplish this Rowe should
be free as much as possible from the receipt of bills from
various creditors when he is not in a position to make payment.

Birmingham listed outstanding bills of informant
Rowe as follows:

RE: EUGENE THOMAS, ET AL

## OBSERVATIONS OF GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

The Bureau is currently paying Gary Thomas Rowe $16.00 per day subsistence in lieu of expenses. This figure was initially decided upon after discussion with the Department, and with the Department's approval, as it was recognized that the informant had to be removed from the Birmingham area for his protection and safety. The Department pointed out that it would not be desirable to make any lump sum or large payment to the informant so long as he might be called upon to testify, as any such large payments might be construed in court as a payment for his testimony, whereas payment of his living expenses can readily be justified as a necessity.

In the trial of subject Collie Leroy Wilkins which began 5-3-65 and resulted in a hung jury, the Bureau was called upon to produce a record of payments to the informant. In a future trial, it is reasonable to expect that we will again be called upon to produce such a record. The payment of Rowe's debts at this time amounting to over two thousand dollars would appear in this record of payments to Rowe, and we certainly could not agree to pay such a large amount at this time without the Department's approval.

With regard to the debts themselves, it would not appear from information furnished by Birmingham that they are all due and payable immediately, as the larger debts to the two banks would probably be payable in monthly installments. We could, with Department's approval, agree to payment of his smaller debts and monthly installments on these larger debts as they come due.

## RECOMMENDATION

In view of the above, it is recommended that Birmingham be instructed to submit a detailed accounting of Rowe's debts showing their basis, when they were contracted, due dates and a full breakdown of any installment contracts showing detailed schedule of payments. Upon receipt of this information, the matter will be discussed with the Department and their views as to whether or not payment of these debts at this time would be judicious, will be obtained. Airtel attached.

(1) The teletype from Inspector J. L. McGovern dated 11-28-65, setting forth the substance of the discussion of John Doar, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division with Gary Thomas Rowe concerning demands made by Rowe. The teletype indicates that McGovern was present during Doar's discussion with Rowe and on page six of the teletype McGovern states that although Bureau personnel were present throughout the interviews between Doar and Rowe, Bureau personnel made no assurance, promises, nor commitments to him.

(2) A copy of the teletype from Mr. McGovern dated 11-23-65, which sets forth in detail the demands made by Rowe. Because of the urgency of relaying Rowe's demands to the Department, a Xerox copy of the teletype was prepared deleting the transmittal data at the top of page one and the last paragraph on page one continuing to the top of page two wherein Rowe expressed his confidence in Bureau personnel and felt he had been let down by the Department and does not trust its representatives.

Inspector James McGovern, San Francisco, has advised that Gary Thomas Rowe, our informant whose testimony is needed in the Federal civil rights trial of the Liuzzo shooting in Montgomery, Alabama, beginning 11/29/65, had exhibited feelings of reluctance to testify for the Government and set forth certain conditions under which he would agree to testify.

These conditions consist of an agreement from the Attorney General that his testimony would not be required in any future proceedings, that he be assisted in obtaining employment and that some assurances be given him for the future security of his ex-wife and children and parents. He also expressed a desire to visit his wife and children in the Tampa, Florida, area over the Thanksgiving holiday.

Rowe's conditions were discussed in detail with Assistant Attorney General John Doar. Mr. Doar advised that he would discuss these conditions immediately with the Attorney General and requested that we arrange for Rowe to visit with his family in Tampa over Thanksgiving, 11/25/65, and that he would then personally meet with Rowe in Tampa on Saturday morning, 11/27/65. He said that he is planning to try the case personally in Montgomery and that Rowe's testimony is vital to a successful trial. He will make every effort to build Rowe's confidence, resolve the conditions set forth by Rowe and obtain his testimony.

ACTION:

Inspector McGovern has been telephonically instructed to proceed immediately with Rowe to Tampa where appropriate arrangements will be made for Rowe to meet with Assistant Attorney General Doar on the morning of 11/27/65.

Attached for approval is a teletype to Mobile and Tampa advising them that Inspector McGovern and Rowe are proceeding to Tampa and that a meeting will be arranged in Tampa between Rowe

This will confirm a discussion of Mr. J.

Viola Liuzzo on March 25, 1065.

Rowe's debts totaling approximately $2,350 consist primarily of personal loans at two banks in Birminghan amounting to about $1,500 and an assossment for Alabang State sales taxes in the amount of $208.50 which resulted fron Drive's operation of a tavern and restaurant from Soptopber, 1964, through March, 1965, The business was a losing enterprise and has reverted to its original proprietor. The balance of the debts are to local utility companies and for apartment rental. The utilities have been disconnected and the apartment reclaimed.

On July 7, 1965, Departmental Attorney St. John Barrett advised Kr. Ilines that the Department was of the opinion that the Bureau should not assure responsibility for payment of Lowe's personal debts. Ho sisted that if any payment is wade to Eowe, it should be for persmal services. Any large payment for personal services shoothe made until after love has testified at the upcomingtrols of the subjects charged with the shooting of ars. Litezochoduled for September and October, 1965..

Mr. Darrett's attention was called to the fact that the Alabama State tax authorities had an outstanding assessment against love for Stato sales taxes in tho-acount of-0208.00. Ur. Darrott stated he was aware of this and that Ir. Paul Johnston, the attorney representing Come in the action for legal fees brought against loo by Attorney Matt Murphy, had brought this assessment to the Department's attention.

FROM: Legal Counsel

MDR-16
ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE: 11/24/75

SUBJECT: TESTIMONY BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE THE
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

On 11/21/75, Inspector John B. Hotis met with Doug Marvin, Counselor to the Attorney General; Mark Wolf, Special Assistant to the Attorney General, and Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, concerning Mr. Levi's forthcoming appearance before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. The Attorney General will have a prepared statement which will probably deal with the future relationship between the Bureau and the Department and the kinds of contacts needed to prevent abuse of authority. Mr. Marvin asked that the Bureau provide the following materials, which will be used in the preparation of a briefing book for Mr. Levi's testimony:

(1) A general synopsis of major areas of the Bureau's activities that have been investigated by the Senate and House Select Committees. Mr. Marvin gave as examples, the "Official and Confidential" files, COINTELPRO, use of informants, and interception of mails. He said the purpose is to identify those topics which have been of primary concern to the Committees. Mr. Marvin asked that the synopses contain a brief statement of the Bureau's position on each of the subjects.

(2). A general statement concerning the organizational structure and functions of the FBI, with particular emphasis on the responsibilities of the Inspection Division. This should include a description of how complaints are received, the review process, and any recent changes in the operations of that Division. In addition, the Attorney General wants a write-up of all investigations of alleged misconduct presently being conducted by the Bureau. He is particularly concerned about any incidents that may have occurred during Mr. Levi's tenure as Attorney General, such as those in Richmond, Detroit, and Houston.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: TESTIMONY BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE THE
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.

(3) A history of Congressional oversight of the Bureau. Mr. Marvin asked that we identify those Subcommittees of Congress which have exercised some oversight responsibilities over the Bureau. In particular, he asked that we review appropriations testimony going back to 1955 to determine whether we discussed topics which are presently of concern to the Select Committees. This will be very useful in demonstrating Congressional awareness of these matters. He also asked that we furnish a statement of the Director's position concerning Congressional oversight which he has previously expressed in speeches or testimony before Congress.

(4) A list of major investigative techniques employed by the Bureau, specifying in each case whether we seek Departmental approval. The more obvious examples are electronic surveillance, use of body recorders, pen registers, informants, and photographic surveillances.

(5) A list of any formal or informal proposals which have been made concerning organizational changes of the FBI. Examples are the creation of an Inspector General's Office in the Department or elsewhere having review authority over the FBI, transfer of counterintelligence functions to another agency or the creation of a separate Division within the Bureau for that function, transfer of drug enforcement responsibilities to the Bureau, and the proposed statutory limitation on the term of the office for the Director.

It should be noted that several position papers concerning such topics were prepared at the request of former Acting Director L. Patrick Gray which might be useful in responding to this request.

Although no date has been set for the Attorney General's testimony, it is expected that he will testify after Mr. Kelley's appearance on 12/9/75. In view of the limited time available, Mr. Marvin asked that we expedite the preparation of these materials and furnish them to his office as soon as they are completed. It is requested that these materials be submitted to the Office of Congressional Affairs, when completed, but no later than cob, Friday, 11/28/75. They should be submitted in insert form suitable for inclusion in a letterhead memorandum.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 140

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: TESTIMONY BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE THE

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That the Intelligence Division prepare a synopsis of the major topics concerning the Bureau which have been investigated by the Senate and House Select Committees.

(2). That the Administrative Division and the Inspection Division prepare materials concerning the organizational structure and function of the Bureau.

(3). That the Administrative Division in conjunction with the Legal Counsel Division prepare materials concerning Congressional oversight of the Bureau.

(4). That the Intelligence Division and the General and Special Investigative Divisions prepare materials: concerning major investigative techniques.

(5) That the Office of Planning and Evaluation prepare materials concerning proposals for organizational changes of the FBI.

(6) In addition to the above specified assignments, it is recommended that every Division review this request and make appropriate recommendations or submit any other materials that might be useful in the preparation of the Attorney General's briefing book.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC letter dated November 7, 1975, and specifically to Item 1 of an accompanying Document Request of same date which requested all materials contained in the files of William C. Sullivan pertaining to Martin Luther King, Jr., and/or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) which have not previously been made available to the Committee. Excluded from consideration in connection with this request were any portions containing transcripts or summaries or tapes of electronic surveillances of King.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery to the SSC of materials in response to Item 1 of the Document Request.

With respect to the excisions in materials being delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations monitored during electronic surveillances of King. In some cases it can be ascertained precisely what information in these materials came from electronic surveillances of King; however, there exist areas where documentation of the information is not precise and no accurate determination can be made. Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions of the materials being furnished do not contain information developed as a result of electronic surveillances of King.

In addition to materials not being furnished the SSC as stipulated by the SSC is a folder classified "Top Secret" bearing a label captioned "Communications Concerning Martin Luther King, Jr., Volume 1" which was located in the files of Mr. Sullivan. A review of that document indicates it contains information which could result in the identification of confidential sources of this Bureau; data obtained in connection with

The identities of these Agents are set out below under the headings as to the particular former informants.

Former Informant Mary Jo Cooke

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Esq.
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination
Office of the Deputy Attorney General

Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Mike:

As a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like to make the following requests.

As discussed in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we invite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence informant and source program that could be inserted in the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to present to the Select Committee a complete description of its program and to discuss the issues of particular interest to the Committee members. These include, for example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program, including an assessment of the program's cost and effectiveness, and the distinctions and relationships between the intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when an informant may be used in an organization or group; and 3) the program's command and control system, including the limits that are placed on the activities of informants and the type of information an informant or source is permitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau. In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible legislation in the informant area, such as the imposition of a warrant requirement or additional administrative review. To permit the Select Committee members to study this memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it with FBI representatives during their testimony at the public hearing, we request that the memorandum be submitted by November 24.

Also I am enclosing requests for documents relating to two of the three former FBI informants who are scheduled to testify on December 4. These requests supplement our document request of August 20, 1975 pertaining to informants (Part IV-4).

In addition, we wish to interview and possibly depose the Special Agents who handled the three former informants (Rowe, Hardy and Cook) who are scheduled to testify at the public hearing on December 4. Because of the limited time remaining before the scheduled hearings, we request that the Special Agents be made available for interviews and depositions as soon as possible.

On 11/25/75, John T. Elliff, Task Force Director of the Domestic Intelligence Task Force for the Senate Select Committee, requested the Bureau designate a witness to appear in executive session before the Senate Select Committee on 12/3 or 12/4 in the afternoon to discuss counterintelligence investigations by the Bureau. Elliff stated because of Chairman Frank Church's interest in a study as to whether counterintelligence investigations should be taken out of the FBI and placed in another agency or a separate component of the Justice Department, this particular topic would be the main focal point of the hearing. Elliff stated that the questions asked of the Bureau's witness would deal primarily with the feasibility of removal of counterintelligence out of the FBI including problems of a logistical and practical nature resulting from such a change. Elliff asked that he be advised as to the identity of the Bureau witness as soon as possible.

Inasmuch as the aforementioned topic is a question of policy, the Director may desire to appear or designate a Bureau witness to appear before the Committee in this matter. Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the Department, is aware of the aforementioned testimony and the possibility exists that the Department may make a decision with regards to the Bureau's providing a witness concerning this matter.

John T. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director of the
Senate Select Committee, advised at 9:15 a.m. on 12/3/75 that
the following is a statement to be read by Senator Frank Church
of that Committee on 12/3/75.

Attorney General Kennedy authorized wiretaps in
1962 on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin and his
secretary and that lasted for about one month. In addition
to the wiretap on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin in
1962, the Committee has received materials from the FBI re-
flecting authorization by Attorney General Kennedy of a
wiretap on a reporter for Newsweek Magazine in 1961 during
the investigation of another leak of classified information.
Further materials reflected authorization by Attorney General
Nicholas Katzenbach for a wiretap on the editor of an anti-
Communist newsletter in 1965, also during the investigation
of a leak of classified information. The Committee has received
materials from the FBI reflecting authorization by Attorney
General Robert F. Kennedy of wiretaps on at least six American
citizens, including three Executive Branch officials, a Con-
gressional Staff Member, and two registered lobbying agents
for foreign interests. The materials also reflect that these
wiretaps relate to an investigation of agents by foreign in-
terests to influence United States economic policies.

Elliff was advised by SA Paul V. Daly of this Division
that an impression would be created by the aforementioned statement
that this Bureau may have conducted an electronic surveillance on
Capitol Hill and that this, of course, was inaccurate. The elec-
tronic surveillance concerning the Congressional Staff Member was
not located on Congressional property. Elliff agreed with this
observation and indicated that he would check the material to
insure the electronic surveillance in question was not on Con-
gressional property and as agreed, make a change in the afore-
mentioned statement.

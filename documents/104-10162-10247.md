MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Irving AMRON

1. Subject responded to the AEEXPLOR3 ad for a position as a Russian language linguist. As was requested of him, he provided the Forms 444, 89, autobiography, and photograph.

2. he undersigned established contact with Subject by phone on 2 September and arrangements were rade to interview him on the following day. He vas interviewed in the Undersigned's Philadelphia hotel room on 3 September 1964. The undersigned used the Paul Peters alias and DOD cover.

3. The following was obtained from AMRON during the interview:

a. Subject, of Jewish descent, was born in 1917 in the USA. Subject's father, whose original name had been

Philip AMROMIM

came to the USA in 1905/06 at the age of approximately 15. Philip AMROMIM's parents stemmed from the CONEL area. At the tine of his emigration to the USA, he was accompanied by his rother (his father died sometime prior thereto), and by the following brothers and sisters: Lewis, Willy, Abe (who has since died), Moris, Minnie (now married to LAIKEN), Pearl, and Max. All of Subject's father's brothers except for Max, are butchers by occupation, including Subject's father. Max graduated from CCHY and became a structural engineer; he has an office on 43rd Street and his firm is called the Amron Associates.

b. Subject's mother, also of Jewish descent, came to the USA in 1911 (or 1913). Her older sister, Fannie, is married to (fnu) COHEN who is presently retired and living in Florida. Her sister, Ruth, married Max AMRON. Her brother, Hyman HORLIK, who arrived in the USA only in 1922, owns a liquor store in Bayoene, New Jersey. Subject's mother has another sister (nu) who is presently living in Florida. Subject's mother has one brother who is still living in the USSR.

c. At the time of Subject's birth, Subject's father was employed in the Brooklyn shipyards. However, he changed jobs frequently and was subsequently employed on a farm near New Brunswick, then in a shoe factory as a cutter, then as a butcher, and finally became active in a Jewish cooperative organization. As Subject's father became convinced that the future of the Jews was in Russia under Soviet Communism, in 1931 Subject's family left the USA for the USSR for Birobidzhan where Subject's father worked as an agronomist (he had sometime prior thereto graduated from the National Farm School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania).

d. According to Subject, his family returned to the USA in 1933; the motivating reason therefor was the ill health--actually *ely sme headaches--cr cumject's brote*, Eugene. Subject alleges that, because they had retained their US citizenship, they experienced no problems either in leaving the USSR or in obtaining permission to return to the USA. Moreover, Subject's father allegedly did not like life in the USSR; however, Subjects mother and sister insisted that they return to the USSR after only a brief stay in the USA.

e. As a result, later in 1933 the entire AMRON family once again returned to the USSR. Again, Subjec. states that they had no problems in obtaining authorization from the Soviet government for this trip to the USSR. on their return to the 165R, they established themselves in Moscow where one Noah LONDON, a friend of the family and a construction engineer, took Subject's father "into his employ". Subject's father worked in this capacity, in the construction industry, from 1933 to 1936. Sometime after the 1936 purges begen, Subject's father worked for Komsomolsk, a Moscow "panel board construction" outfit. In 1936 Subject's father also worked for the Paris Commune as a shoemaker. Subject's mother worked during this entire period as chief of a dining establishment in the school of foreign languages in Moscow.

f. Subject began his elementary education at the Dewitt Cliaton School in the USA where he studied until 1931; he then studied in the Soviet secondary school in Khabarovsk, Birobidzhan, until 1933. In 1933 he again returned for one semester to the Dewitt Clinton School. Later in 1933 and 1934 he attended the Anglo-American School in Moscow where be completed his 8th grade of school. He then continued his studies from 1933 to 1936 in Public School #327 in the 24th Bauman Rayon. In 1936 he entered the Moscow Avtodorozhniy Institut where he studied on the civil engineering faculty, to be a highway engineer. He graduated in 1941 at which time he was sent to assist

in the construction of an airdrome in Minsk, latfer to the Polish station of Janow.

g. In 1937 Subject's mother was dismissed from her position and both she and Subject's father began to feel the pressure of the purges. Subject's father, allegedly by appealing to the then President KALININ, succeeded in again acquiring exit visas for them to the USA. Subject, who admits that he had become a "good Communist" ty then had gotton *thoroughly steeped* in the Communist philosophy, elected to remain behind in the USSR. An important consideration, he states, vas his desire to complete his education which he vas certain he would not be able to do in the USA for economic ressons.

h. According to Subject, his father never lost his American citizenship. Subject's mother, however, in 1936 applied for an obtained Soviet citizenship. necordingst, ha actually acquired Soviet citizenship "by default" although he never applied for this in person; he alleges that although he was 18 years of age abe tine, he was "granted" Soviet citizenship by virtue of his Domer's application for her om citizenshu.

i. Subject remained in Moscow price to World War II. In April 1940 he married

Nina MOISEYIVA
a bookkeeper by profession,

who was the step-daughter of the well-known Major SEOGOLEV of the "Soviet Proleteriat Regiment". A son was born to them in June 1941. Although at this time Subject was assigned to the construction of aerodromes to support front line troops, he succeeded in pulling strings and in arranging a "DY trip" to Moscow, ostensibly to visit the Geodetic Institute. Earcute back from Moscow to the front lines, Subject's train got bombed in Brest Litovsk on 22 June 1941 and as a result he was returned to Moscow on the same train via Baranovichi. According to Subject, he was then assigned to the Moscow Military District, to the Ctdel Aerodrommoi Sluzhby, where he was placed in charge of a brigade of engineers, technicians and laborers who were engaged in building dummy air sites for camouflage purposes.

j. In August 1941 Subject states that he was permitted to return to school in order to receive his diploma which was granted him in October 1941. He was then assigned to the 22nd Voyenno-Dorozhaiy Otryad which was formed in Dmitrov but which was then assigned to Suzdal'. Subject states that he was not inducted into the Soviet military service allegedly because "engineers were needed" and

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 5

SECRET

because, as a member of the MD, this was considered as equivalent to military service. Nonetheless, in response to my query, Subject admitted that this was unusual as his activities were a kind which vere performed by old voren particularly since during this period, from October 1941 to September 1942, all able-bodied Soviet males were drafted into the Soviet army. During this period Subject lived in comparative ease, being assigned to Suzdal and Klin, and other towns. According to Subject, be wore an M.D uniform but vore no insignia. He admitted that "favored treatment" was bestowed upon him and his family when the assisted him in evacuating his first wife and son from Moscow in August 1941 to beyond the Urals. (His son by his first wife reporteily died on 11 October 1943 of diabetes.)

k. In September 1942, Subject received an appcintzent to the Moscow 2nd Military Infantry Institute from which he graduated in June 193n which he tale of Jr Line Soviet Infantry. In response to my query, Subject again admitted that this appointment was highly unusual as his background did not lend itself to this, as appointzents were made out of the various military branches, and as this implied that, as a foreigner (American), he was fully and completel trusted by the Soviet punitive organs who had cleared him both for this training and the institute and for promotion to officer status in the Soviet Army.

1. Initially he was sent to Alater on the Volga, then to Orel where he was assigned to the front lines in August 1943. He was given a platoon of infantry troops in the 415th Infantry Division of the Soviet Central Front. However, in October 1943 he was wounded; he vas hit in the left forehead by e German bullet. Ee was operated on in a field hospital and then transferred to a Moscow hospital after he had recovered sufficiently. He was reclassified after his recovery and found suitable to continue in military service with the limitation that he should not serve on the front lines (goden vtoroi stepeni).

m. Because the wound failed to heal completely (be has a very obvious scar, with approximately a 1" depression, on his forehead), he "asked" to be assigned to a warmer clizate. The Soviet authorities, he states, complied and in January 1944 dispatched him to Tbilisi where he was placed in a special officer's camp; he ves hospitalized again, bad osteomyelitis complications, and ultimately discharged from the Soviet military forces. Eowever, Subject provided several contradictory stories as to the date of discharge which at various times be indicated occurred in May 1944, then in July 194, and even in August 1944. (NOTE: This aspect of Subject's story bothered hir as it vas obvious to the undersigned that Subject had somewhere become confused in this aspect of his background.)

n. Upon his discharge, he was returned to the Moscow area where he was placed in a rest home (although Subject admitted that there really existed no need for this as he had recovered already prior to his discharge). In continuing his narration, Subject indicated that the rest of his story "sounds very strange and unbelievable" but then averred that it was true. He states that, strange as it appears and despite the shortage of Soviet men at the time (1944) he could not "find" himself a job. He went to the MVD which did offer him a job in Veliki Luki on the highways with the ScyuzDorog-Proyekt; however, he was not given the job by the officials responsible for this. As a result, he appealed directly to the Minister of the MVD who "tried to intercede" in Subject's behalf. Allegedly after he was given a full physical examination, he was told that he could not be assigned to the highway units for reasons which were not spelled out to Subject.

o. Subject then "sought out" work with the Nauchniy Sovet with no luck. He ultimately obtained a job with the Moscow Soviet in the Moscow Soviet Senior Library (sic). In November 1944, at a salary of 900 rubles, Subject began working in the field of "information on municipal works-highway construction, architecture, sanitation, etc." His immediate supervisor was (fnu) LIEEEDEV, the head of information department of the Pydro-Energy Project. Subject admitted, in reply to the undersigned's query, that his work was "unusual" for several reasons. First, he was paid a salary which was unusually high and out of line with his qualifications. Secondly, though paid a salary for a full-time job and position, he actually worked on a part-time basis and was able to come and go almost as he wished. His work also included working on abstracts and translations from English to Russian, primarily in the field of dams, dam construction, and hydraulics.

p. In June 1949 Subject states that he was dismissed from the foregoing position after he was given the explanation that the flow of literature from the USA, which Subject was translating, had decreased. In actual fact, Subject states, he was being "purged" because he was a Jew. He then found a job as a laboratory assistant in a concrete plant where he worked from July 1949 to 23 February 1950. Because he did not like that job, Subject states he wrote to Stalin personally as a result of which, within less than 4 weeks, he was offered 4-5 different jobs. The positions were offered to him by the Moscow Committee of the CP to whom "Stalin had forwarded the letter". In reply to my query, Subject admitted that he was not concerned that, by writing to Stalin, he would come to the attention of the Soviet punitive organs, MVD/MGB, which would undertake to investigate his case. Accordingly, on 1 April 1950 Subject was given a job as an

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 7

engineer with the Bezman District Road Department where he worked until February 1955.

q. After he lost his job in 1949 with the Moscow Sovet, he states that his relations with his wife went from bad to worse and ultimately cultirated first in a separation and latter in a divorce in 1950. In the meantime, he was already living with

Eugenia VOLSOVA

an empolyee and a teacher of forsenic medicine of the Moscow Medical Institute where she vas studying for her PhD and where she was working as a pathologist. Subject married her either in 1950 or 1951. Hoverer, within less than one month of their carriage, Subject divorced her as he found out that she vas a "tad person" and because he "had falien blindly in love" with her. (NOTE: This aspect of Subject's story disturbed him very much. He vas wasure of himself, wes vegue on dates, details, specifics, cames, etc. It was again obvious that Subject was less than frank and open about this aspect of his beckground. His narratica did not sound convincing to Subject hinsche when he began talking about "falling blindly in Love", etc.) In 1952 he began living with another man,

Rose MINKINA,

whom he married only in late 1954 when their son was already vell on the way. MINKINA's parents and family were very strongly opposed to the marriage because the parents held responsible party positions and because MINKINA's brother held a sensitive position with the Soviet electronics and aviation industries. A son vas born to Subject and MINKIKA on 5 April 1955.

r. In ca 1954 (dates vague) Subject entered the Institute of Marxism-Leninism and continued his studies for three or more years. Though he registered for the evening sessions, he devoted a good portion of his days to study. As a result, Subject again admitted to the undersigned that he actually was in a unique position of being able to do alrost as he "wished and desired" although ostensibly be was a full-time employee of the Bauman District Road Department. While a student at the Institute of Marxist-Leninism, Subject and his wife began submitting applications for a visa to visit Subject's parents in the USA. In actual fact, Subject states, his real purpose in applying for the visa vas to "defect" upon his arrival in the USA. In February 1955 Subject states that be was fired" from his job with the Bauman District because of "political unreliability". Hovever, Subject adaitted to the undersigned that the real reason for dismissal

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

SEGTET

-7-

must have been otherwise as, had he actually been dismissed for "political unreliability", he would not have been able to continue his studies at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism.

5. Because Subject had communicated to his father, using "hidden phrases" in their letters to each other, about his wish to leave the USER, Subject's father arrived in the USSR in 1957 in order, Subject states, "to establish at first hand for hizsel" whether Subject really wished to "defect to the USA". Subject's father remained in the USSR for a total of 10 days. As a result of his father's visit, Subject changed his tactics and began to submit applications for "imigration" to the USA. As earlier, these to rajected; ect states
   continued resubmitting then several times each year.

t. After he left the Bauman District place of employment in February 1955, Subject found work as a "free lance translator for the Moscow Torgovaya Palata. He earned ca 100 rubles per south translating English language caterial related to the iron and steel plant which was being designed by the USSR for erection in India. In January 1956 Subject fond work as chief of the translations bureau of the Nauchno-Issledovcelriv Institut Ministerstva Mashiro-Stroyeniya; his functions consisted primarily of supervising the translation of English language sanruals on technical equitment. Again, Subject admitted that his work was "umsual" as, in actual fact, he spent 1-2 days at work, spent the rest of his time at home, and devoted most of his time and energy to the studies at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Sis salary continued at 1100 rubles per month.

In August 1958 his work came to an end. Generally he provided a contardictory account in this respect. Initially he stated that the position had been eliminated but then changed this story to state that he resigned in August 1958 as he vould have had to begla devoting his full tize to the work. In any case, his resignation generally coincided with his completion of studies at the Institute of Farrisn-Leninism. Thereafter, and until his inmigration to the USA in 1962, Sabject held no full tire job. Nonetheless, he states that he succeeded in earning no less than about 1100 rubles per mouth by working as a free lance translator for the Torgovaya Palata of Moscov. Ee turned over to the undersigned a sample of his translation efforts-see the attached bocs. In response to. my query, Subject admitted that his work again vas of such a nature that he was a free agent, came and went as he pleased, and generally vas responsible to no one. Apparently in order to

SEGTET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

-8-

forestall any further discussions in this regard, Surject then stated that "if you are thinking that I could have worked for the KGB et this time, then you are right because I had the tire to do anything including engaging in intelligence activities". However, Subject then proceeded to deny that he had then or at any time, tad any relationship with the KGB (or its predecessor organizations).

V. In July 1962 Subject's mother and father came to Moscow, this specifically for the purpose of getting Subject to return to the USA. They stayed in Moscow.

other wote letters to KEPISECEV, to Nina FERMERCEVA, to ADZHUBEI, to the Supreme Soviet, to the KB, and to other Soviet establish-ments in order to get Subject and his son permission for enderation to the USA. (Subject's wife, MOTIVA, had died in 1961.) In August 1962, vile vacationing in Sochi Subject ves sought out by the local Inturist office and epprised by the local militia office that, "in view of your father's strong appeals", the USSR had grented Subject and his son permission to leave the USSR. Upon his return to Moscow, Subject proceeded to the American Embassy where he vas advised that he had not been granted an exit visa by the Soviets. As a result, Subject applied for rigretion to the USA twice, once in the capacity of a Soviet citizen using his Soviet passport, and the second time in the capacity of an "American citizen".

V. In September 1962 the application to travel to the USA as an "izmigrant" was approved for him and his son. Therefore, vithout waiting to receive approval to travel ander his claix of being an "American citizen", Subject left the USSR and entered the USA on his Soviet passport together with his soa on 24 September 1962 via Idlewild. Upon his arrival in the SA, Subject imediately undertook action to have his "American citizenship" restored. This was initially denied as he had admitted that he had voted in the Soviet national elections. However, he then retained an attorney who appealed the case; the original decision ves then reversed and both Subject and his son had their S citizenship restored to then in the summer of 1963, the reversal was based ca Subject's clain that be bad had no choice and vas, therefore, compelled to vote in the USSR national elections.

X. Upon his arrival in the SA, Subject immediately applied for a position with the in, however, he was rejected as he was "state-less" at the time. He then accepted a position with Stelling, Lori-Wood, and sa Suetendals, 36th Street, working on site-planning. Eis supervisor, one Frank McGovan, then recommended Subject to the

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

# SECRET

Blaurelt engineering firm for whom he worked from January 1963 through July 1964. In 1964 Subject found work with Farold J. SALDEN, 60 Broad Street, Red Bank, New Jersey, as an engineer working on the planning and designing of sub-divisions, grading, construction developments, etc. Ris immediate superviser is the township engineer of Marlboro Township, New Jersey. Eis present salary is $100.00 per month.

y. In April 1963 Subject married

Bella HINCBERG nee MILSTEIN

a Polish Jew who had come to the USA from Poland in 1949. She has come by her previous marriage(s). Subject and his son now live in the home of his present wife.

4. Comments and Assessment:

a. Subject speaks native English and passes for a middle class American. Eis Russian is likewise native.

b. According to Subject, his objective in life now is to work for the US Government. Ee states that he has submitted Forms 57 to a number of the US Government agencies (he did not elaborate). In applying for the position under AER, Subject asked for $10,000.00 per annuum which is his asking price for a position with the US Government.

c. According to Subject, his present position is excellent with great potential for going into partnership as soon as he becomes a licensed engineer. However, he states that he is not interested in making money (despite his request for a $10,000.00 salary) but in "fighting Communism" as an employee of the US Government.

d. Subject admitted that he was a firm and strong believer of Communism which, incidentally, was the reason why he remained behind in the USSR when his parents returned to the USA in 1937. Ee states that he continued to be a firm believer of Communism until approximately 1958/59 when he became "disenchanted with Communism". Subject denies that he was a member of the Komsomol or that he had to join the Communist Party, this despite the fact that he became an officer of the Soviet Army and despite the fact that he was accepted to study at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Despite his alleged "disenchantment" with Communism, Subject spoke in flattering terms about life in the USSR, about the "democracy", about equal opportunities, about the excellent "educational system", et cetera. Subject admitted that

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

SECRET

-10-

he had led almost a "charming existence" in the USSR and that neither life in the USSR nor the Soviet authorities mistreated him.

e. According to Subject, he was never arrested in the Soviet Union.

f. In reply to my query, Subject indicated that in 1958 the KGB tried to co-opt him into reporting a fellow student at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. However, Subject states that he rejectd the pitch. In reply to various queries which were posed to him about the fellow-student (name allegedly now forgotton), Subject states that he did render an unfavorable report on the person. Despite this, the particular Soviet was ultimately assigned abroad as an interpreter. Subject later heard that the Soviet worked and traveled both Japan and Italy.

g. In reply to a general query about life in the USSR, Subject indicated that life in the USSR has made him into "an accomplished prevaricator".

h. Subject was less than fluent in relating the story of his life to the undersigned. He made mistakes frequently, he contradicted himself, he altered dates to accommodate other aspects of his activities to correspond with what he had mentioned earlier, etc. Also, Subject repeatedly tried to digress from relating his story into presenting his views of life; it was a chore to keep him on substantive matters relating to his own background.

i. Subject's brother, Eugene, is now employed as an engineer of the Freehall Township, New Jersey. Additionally, he has a private office in Rockland, New Jersey, called the Civil Engineer Associates.

j. Subject's account of how he acquired Soviet citizenship--see above--is a very weak item in Subject's story. He will have us believe that he got Soviet citizenship "by default" as a result of his mother's application for Soviet citizenship for herself. He himself admitted to the undersigned that this is illogical as his brother, Eugene, whose status was no different from Subject's, never acquired Soviet citizenship "by default" though Subject did allegedly without any action whatever on his own part. Moreover, Subject admitted that he was legally of age (18) by this time and no longer a dependent as a result of which he would have had to apply for a Soviet passport and for Soviet citizenship of his own free volition rather than through his mother.

k. Subject is aware that the story of his *"imigration"* to the USA is also weak. He tried to explain this away by stating that he *"got cut by mistake"*, that he was permitted to go *"to hide the Soviet shame surrounding the Cuban crisis"*, that *"someone had committed an error"*, etc. He admitted that there exists no other explanation as to why the Soviet government would have permitted him to leave the USSR as, in the eyes of the Soviet government, he was a full fledged and responsible Soviet citizen who had no genuine or legitimate claim to American citizenship. As a result, Subject is unusually sensitive to this topic.

5. CONCLUSION:

a. In the opinion of the undersigned, Subject should not be considered for either ABSCREEN or ABEXPLORE despite the fact both his English and Russian are native.

b. On the basis of the interview, the undersigned feels that, Subject is less than frank and that he is prevaricating. Moreover, there exist innumerable items in Subject's tale which are indicative both that he worked as a recruited agent of the KGB (and its predecessor organizations) in the USSR and that he left the USSR only through and with the intercession of the KGB.

6. It should be underscored that because of the unique and sensitive cover used by the undersigned, no attempt was made to resolve the various contradictions, to challenge Subject on any of his statements, or to pursue certain points of their logical conclusion. The foregoing was obtained in the form of an interview and no real attempt could be made, given the cover, to delve more deeply into the suspicious aspects of Subject's background.

# SUPPLEMENT
to
AUTOBIOGRAPHY
of
IRVING ARON

During the years I spent in the Soviet Union I had many friends. Among them were writers, journalists, engineers, doctors and professionals in different fields. It would be very difficult to list ali of them. ?or instance, during the last year I met a new neighbour in the building I moved into. He was a professor in the field of economics. His name was Barsky and he told me many things which I never knew ab-ut concerning the economic basis of the Soviets system. He noted that with an industrial labour force exceeding the labour force of the U. S. A. by 100% the productivity of labour and industrial production wasthree times lower.

While studying in high school I became acquainted with a well-known movie producer - Alexander Stolper. He is the brother of one of the students with whom I was freidly in high school. Besides, through a friend in college I met with several writers and journalists such as Dykhovichny, Slobodskoy, and others writing in the field of satire.

People working in cla cified fields of industry never talk about their work. And even though my relatives through my wife in Russia worked in the fieldof aviation and electronics I did not know anything about their ork, I only knew that my wife's brother worked in F-.., and her brother-in-law worked near Sokol (both in Moscow). Her brother's name is Lev Minkin and her brother-in-law's name is Boris Bershadsky.

During te last years I worked as a translator and met many people who were born in the U. S. A. Among them are Morza Shirman. Paul Shiman, Grace Duetch-Ecogay (nee Sgovic) - now in Italy, and many others.

Contleman:

In answer to your advertisement in the New York Times of June 21, 1964 for a Russian linguist capable of translating analyzing and editing publications, as well as interpreting, I am enclosing Ly resume.

I lived in Russia for over 25 years and graduated college there after the beginning of the German-hussian war. After 7 years of continuous attempts to leave Aussia, I was repatriated in September, 1962. I az a native-born citizen of the United States of America.

In fussia I worked as a translator, editor and head of Translator's Bureaus for twenty years. My experience in translating, abstracting and selection of technical articles for publication is significant. My initial salary requirements are $10,000 per year. I would appreciate the opportunity of a personal interview for discussing possibilities which may exist for me in your organization.

Sincerely yours,

Frung hinein

Irving Arron

Born December 4, 1917, Brooklyn, N. Y. Bachelor of Science, 1941
Married, 2 children Moscow Automobile Highway Institute

I was born December 4, 1917 in Brooklyn, N. Y. My father, Philip Anson was
successively a farmer, a shoemaker, a butcher and worked in a Jewish coop-
erative organization. In 1931, at the age of 13, I left for Russia with my
parents. My father in Russia worked as an agronomist in Biro-Bidjan,
attended school in Khabarovsk. In January, 1933, our family returned to the
U. S. A. due to the illness of my younger brother. In September, 1933 we
returned to Russia. My father then worked in construction as a manager, and
later worked in a store factory as a shoemaker. My mother worked as a manager
in a public dining room. I graduated high school in Moscow in 1936 and was
accepted as a student in the Moscow Automobile & Highway Institute. In 1937
my parents and brother returned to the U. S. A. I remained in Moscow as I
wished to finish my courses in college. I graduated in 1941, after the
beginning of war with Germany and was sent as a superintendent to a Highway
Bat. In September, 1942 I was sent to Military School in Moscow. After
finishing as a 2nd Lt. I was in active duty as a platoon officer. I was
wounded Oct. 11, 1943. I was operated upon three times, the last time in
April, 1945. After being discharged from the Soviet Army due to combat dis-
ability I got a job as a senior librarian in the Technical Library of the
Moscow City Soviet. In 1949 due to the small number of publications being
received from abroad my position in the library was eliminated. I then got
a job as a laboratory assistant in a concrete plant and after a reduction
of forces I got a job as a senior engineer in the Bauman Boro Road Repair
Dept. At this time I was divorced and re-married. My first wife was a
bookkeeper. Her step father was a major in the Soviet Army. He was later
killed in 1942, during WW II. Her maiden name, or her stepfather was
Shchegolyeva. My second wife (maiden name - Volsova) was a pathologist.
She hid the fact that she could not have children and we were divorced one
month after my marriage. In 1952 I met Rose Marzina. We were officially
married only a few months before our son was born. The cause of this delay
in our marriage was the fact that I was born in the United States. Her brother
is an aviation engineer and her brother-in-law works in the field of elec-
tronics. Her sister considered that our marriage would harm my wife's re-
latives. In 1955, after the birth of our son we began handing in applica-
tions for an exit visa from the Soviet Government. At first we tried to
get out as visitors to my parents. We received our first refusal at the
time of the Hungarian Revolt. Up till 1957, when my father came to visit us
we continued to hand in applications for an exit visa as visitors. After
1957 we continued to hand in applications approximately every six months
to leave the Soviet Union permanently. And we continued to regularly hear
refusals. I consider that the agravations connected with these refusals
contributed to the causes of my wife's death in March, 1961. And only in
July, 1962 my son and I received exit visas. As I mentioned in Form 444 I
filled in two different applications. The first answer to the applications
I filled out in the U. S. Embassy in Moscow: as an immigrant and as a native-
born citizen was a Hongusta immigrant visa. The Board of Appeals of the
Dept. of State, after my arrival, restored my native-born citizenship.

In 1955, due to a reduction of forces I lost my staff job in the
Bauman Road Repair Dept. At this time I was working as a free-lance
translator in the U.S.S.R. Chamber of Commerce and as a part-time trans-
lator in Hydroenergoproject. Until January of 1956 I worked for these
organizations. In 1956 I began working as the Head of the Translators Dept.
of the Scientific-Research Institute of Construction and Road-Building
Machinery. After having finished the translation of all manuals in this
field I continued working until I left the Soviet Union as a free-lance
translator and editor for the Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Trade
Publishing House, the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Hydro energoproject
and other organizations requiring translators.

After returning to the U. S. A. I got a job as a civil engineer. At
first I worked for Stelling, Lord-Wood and Van Suetendael from Nov., 1962
to Dec., 1962 and then from January, 1963 to July, 1964 I worked for
Blauvelt Engineering Co. At present I am working for Harold J. Seldin,
60 Broad St., Red Bank, New Jersey. During the last several months I have
been working on a free-lance basis with AEREACI Corporation (1634 Arch St.,
Philadelphia, Pa.) as an abstractor.

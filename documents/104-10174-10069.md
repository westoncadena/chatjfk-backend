Mr. Miguel Tirado
2925 Waverley Drive
Los Angeles, California

Dear Friend,

Merry Christmas!

I regret that it has taken this long to settle the matter of your letter of September 22, 1968, but better late than never, I guess. Although your efforts in our behalf with Hank were not successful, we do appreciate the fact that you and your wife went out of your way to try to help us.

I referred the matter of your late moving bill to the appropriate individual. Unfortunately, this bill was received too late, as all your accounts had been settled. He has asked me to extend his regrets on this matter.

Please accept my best wishes for a Joyous Christmas and the hope that 1969 will indeed be a good year for you and yours.

Sincerely,

Gale

MEMORANDUM FOR: DO/CO/C

ATTENTION: Gale W. Allen

SUBJECT: Howard T. FAZZARE

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum dated 26 September 1968

1. In the reference you stated that DO will send FAZZARE a sterile check for his expenses incurred in his efforts to persuade TICHBORN's wife to agree to an assignment in Spain. You also forwarded a bill which FAZZARE sent for additional air freight expenses from Madrid for which he has not been reimbursed.

2. EUR does not wish to reimburse FAZZARE for this claim. When he resigned from the Agency he submitted his final accounting and signed a Quit-Claim for all expenses. In his note to you, a copy of which you forwarded with reference, he asked that you forward his bill "to the Spanish Section for reimbursement if not too late..." We would appreciate it if you could send FAZZARE a note when you forward his sterile check and state that we are sorry but this final accounting has been completed, that the books have been cleared, and that it is indeed too late to authorize additional funds.

MEMORANDUM FOR: RECORD

SUBJECT: Project WUBRINY - Termination Settlement with Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

1. The undersigned on 12 September 1968 went to New York to effect a termination settlement with Edward G. TICHSORN (P). A hotel room at the Shoreham Hotel, 33 West 55th Street, was obtained for a meeting place. There were two principal aspects to the settlement:

a. secure TICHBORN's acceptance of an amendment to his contract providing for a one-time lump sum taxable payment of $3311.00 and releasing the U. S. Government from any further claim and,

b. insure that TICHBORN had, as. of 31 August 1968, administratively severed his relationship with WUSALINE, particularly that his accountings for expenses incurred in 1968 were submitted, recorded by WUSALINE, and certified correct and proper by both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11.

2. The first part of the settlement went smoothly. TICHBORN on 12 September 1968 readily accepted the amendment to his basic contract. He brought along for the Covert Tax Unit a copy of his 1966 income tax return which the undersigned had stipulated as a requirement for settlement. He was given his one-time lump sum taxable payment of $3311 in two checks ($2833.62 and $477.38) drawn on a DO proprietary company (WUTACTIC) which will issue TICHBORN a Form 1099 for income tax filing. He readily endorsed and gave to the undersigned the check for $477.38 in settlement of the amount he owed WH Division from his tour in Mexico City.

3. Through no fault of TiCnborn, the administrative Severance from WUSALINE did not go as smoothly. In spite of several requests by bot. TICHBORN and the undersigned,

WUBRINY/11 did not have ready a list of expenses incurred
by TICHBORN in 1968 for checking by the undersigned and
certification by TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11. WUBRINY/11
telephoned to say that his accountant was unable to
locate some of TICHBORN's accountings. The undersigned
then requested WUBRINY/11 to join him and TICHBORN. The
undersigned had a partial list of TICHBORN's expenses
previously submitted by WUBRINY/11. The undersigned
enjoined TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to prepare a complete
list of expenses for 1968. TICHBORN was asked to record
the purpose of each expense. The undersigned emphasized
in WUBRINY/1l's presence that TICHBORN should ensure that
no expenses chargeable to WUBRINY/1's private firm were
charged to WUSALINE. Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/ll were
reminded that all expenses on the Venezuela project were
chargeable to WUBRINY/1's private firm as well as one-half
of the expenses on the Mexican Border project. TICH BORN
said that he would get all of the accountings from WUBRINY/11's
comptroller to determine which, if any, accountings were
missing and, as requested, to note the purpose of the
expenses. It was agreed to meet the following morning.
of September 13, 1968 on this matter.

4. On the morning of September 13, 1968, TICHBORN
   telephoned, the undersigned to say that he was able from
   his records to supply the missing data. He also sald
   that notations on the records obtained from the comptroller
   showed that he had, in fact, submitted the accountings that
   were missing. TICHBORN concluded from this that WUBRINY/1's
   private firmi had lost the missing accountings. TICHBORN
   also said that a few of the charges on the partial list
   of expenses which the undersigned had given him to review
   should have been charged to WUBRINY/l's private firm.
   The
   undersigned then requested TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to meet
   with him at noon so that the undersigned could review the
   accountings and obtain certifications from TICHBORN and
   WUBRINY/11. Both agreed to the meeting. Subsequently,
   TICHBORN telephoned to say that he and WUBRINY/11 were
   all set to come to the undersigned's hotel when the
   unwitting comptroller took all the financial statements
   to review them again. TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 were in
   no position to retain the statements and thus could not
   meet as scheduled. Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 agreed
   that the accountings were now in order. The undersigned
   again informed TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 by phone that each
   must certify that the expenses were proper charges to
   WUSALINE. WUBRINY/11 was instructed to mail the list
   to the undersigned as soon as possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 22

5. Certain other administrative matters were taken up with TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 during the after- noon of 12 September 1968. The undersigned secured agreement from TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 that TICHBORN'S services on WUBRINY/l's Venezuela project were as great as any other officer who worked on it and that, therefore, WUSALINE should receive for TICHBORN's services on this project compensation at least equal to that given any officer in WUBRINY/1's private firm. The undersigned obtained from TICHBORN the two credit cards (American Express and Pan American air travel card) issued to him under WUSALINE sponsorship. The undersigned asked TICHBORN if he had charged any expenses under these cards since 31 August 1968. TICHBORN said that he had entertained a movie producer who visited him as an outgrowth of his trip to California to develop a movie adjunct to his cover. For this reason, TICHBORN opined that the Agency should pay for the expense. The undersigned said that TICHBORN was not authorized to incur any further expenses after 31 August 1968. TICHBORN then readily agreed to pay the expense.

6. There is a possibility that WH Division may want TICHBORN to take an operational TDY in Chile.. TICHBORN was alerted to this possibility. He expressed interest in the assignment, but pointed out that he now has to get a job and that, consequently, his availability will depend upon his job situation.

7. TICHBORN was extremely friendly and cooperative and the settlement was amicably effected.

MEMORANDUM FOR: The Record

SUBJECT: Project WUTACTIC - Funding Through WUGAMP

1. On Monday afternoon, the undersigned was requested by Mr. Gale Allen, DO/CO, to provide a mechanism for funding $3,311.00 to an Agent he was terminating (Edward G. TICHBORN (P). Mr. Allen is traveling to New York on Thursday, 12 September 1968 and would like to pay the termization bonus to TICHBORN at that time. Prior to our discussion, Mr. Allen had arranged for the funds to be paid by sterile check. However, Mr. Randall, DO/BF, suggested that he consult DO/CM for a funding mechanism in order to insure proper tax reporting by TICHBORN.

2. Mr. Allen explained to the undersigned that TICHBORN had been employed, until his termination, by one of the Project WUBRINY entities. Apparently, there is an unwitting Comptroller in the WUBRINY entity and there was no reasonable story that could be offered to explain the $3,311.00 termination bonus. Therefore, it is necessary to use another entity that can provide a Form 1099 for tax purposes.

3. Since WUGAMP has sufficient funds in its bank account to manage a $3,311.00 disbursement, it was decided to utilize this company. Mr. Allen was advised to stop the sterile check process and to have the $3,311.00 voucher approved and forwarded to DO/CM for payment instructions. At that time, the undersigned will prepare a Request for Advance of Funds (WUTACTIC) in the amount of $689.00 and Payment Instructions for $4,000.00 ($3,311.00 plus $689.00). This procedure is being followed in order that WUGAMP can show a slight profit as well as to prevent the exact same amount of money being received and disbursed.

MEMO TO : AG

FROM : LH TICHBORN

IN RE : Meetings with MT re Spain

I had several long conversations with MT regarding various aspects of potential assignment in Spain:

a) long confab over two drinks after our joint session Wednesday afternoon;

b) shorter talk on plane ride to New York;

c) extended conversation on Thursday evening, when we had dinner with our respective spouses - 6:30 PM to 2:00 AM..

Our many hours together (with and without our wives) produced two principal conclusions:

1. Reinforced my wife's objections to moving to Spain, also convincing me that it would be prejudicial for my children.

2. Convinced me that, even if there were no family objections to moving, it would be unwise to establish permanent residence in Spain because of the security risks involved therein. Both MT and I feel that several in-and-out trips would accomplish our purposes without running the risk of appearing implausible in that traditionally-suspicious country.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

2. 
A. Family obiections to moving:

1. Health hazards - My wife's fears about hepatitis and other diseases (originally aroused by Mike's casual reference to same) were anauhat reinforced by MT and wife's pointci cautions about food and water.

2. Negative effect on my children - When my wife explained Greg's school difficulties since moving from Mexico (he failed three subjects last semester and is attending summer school), both MT and wife flatly said that it would be risky and perhaps-permanently-danaging to move him once again. Mrs. T. who is a professional guidance counselor for children, fully agreed ag with the child child psychologists who has advised us against moving Greg out of the United States at this tire. Having fallen behind in his reading skills while in Mexico (1.e.. in relation to U.S. standards), he's now suffering certain psychological setbacks that are related to his scholastic difficulties.

B.. Securit risks of projected cover:

Even if there were no family objections to our moving to Spain, by conversations with MT have convinced me that our present "cover arrangements" will not

En support permanent residence in Spain.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

As I had previously surmised, MT says that Spain is an inordinately suspicious country - that almost everyone suspects all foreigners of some ties with foreign banks. He himself was frequently told to his face that he was a bank employee, and he told us that at our two meetings last Tuesday and Wednesday. He says that government officials and the kind of higher-up business tycoons we're shooting for (he saw our list) are almost pathological in their suspicions.

MT : "You're going to have to live like a rich man to have access to those people, and no rich man would move to Spain with his family unless he had already established the kind of business activity that would pay him enough to warrant such a move. Mere prospecting for business opportunities might draw such a man for short look-around visits, but he would look pretty foolish moving his whole family just to 'prospect.' Those sharp-nosed Spanish industrialista would smell you out within a few months perhaps a few weeks."

MT agrees with all of us that the movie cover offers the best and least-expensive chance for penetration, but here again he argues against establishing permane


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

4. 
residence:

"My father and brother (president of Associated Distributors of Spanish-Speaking Films) have been in motion pictures all their lives, and I know from my peripheral exposure to the business that no producer would establish permanent residence unless he's actually filming a big picture. Until he actually starts shooting, the producer flits in and out of the country, rushing back to Hollywood or New York to work on other picture deals. Movio people are expected to be jet-setty; they don't travel with their goddamned families, certainly not kids. As a "bachelor" producer with a temporary suite at the Hilton or Ritz, where you could invite Mr. Tycoon to mingle with starlets and models, you could be quite plausible as a guy who's still looking for the right picture deal to jell (perhaps for a couple of years).

In view of our previous inactive relationship with our Iberian associate (and Mike's continued skepticism). I frankly agree with MT's reservations about establishing permanent residence while in the "prospecting stage." The over-all prospects and utility of PACI K be compromised by an implausible cover at any stage.

MEMORANDUM FOR: RECORD

SUBJECT : Project WUBRINY - Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

1. At the request of Chief, DO/COG, the WOFIRM medical staff arranged for TICHBORN to be examined by a specialist in back disorders to check the nature of TICHBORN's back problem. TICHBORN had earlier injured his back when a bench on which he was sitting in the laundry room of his apartment collapsed. Since his injury, TICHBORN has, of course, been under the care of a doctor in New York. A back brace and physical therapy exercises have led to considerable improvement. However, in view of plans for TICHBORN'S PCS assignment to Spain, a check by an independent specialist was deemed advisable.

2. TICHBORN's appointment was with Dr. Henry L. Feffer, 2520 L St. N.W., Washington, D.C. at 1115 hours on 19 June 1968. TICHBORN used the alias of Enrique Cortez with a New York post-office address supplied by the Office of Security, to wit:

P. O. Box 432
Church Street Station
New York, N. Y. 10008

He paid the bill of $38.50 upon leaving. The receptionist asked the name of TICHBORN's doctor and where the report should be sent. TICHBORN gave a fictitious name and address of a doctor in New York and said that Dr. Feffer knew where to send the report. (The report will be sent to Dr. Borscher- ding of the WOFIRM Medical Staff who will call C/DO/COG.)

3. At a luncheon meeting at Fort Myer after the examination, TICHBORN informed Chief, DO/COG and the undersigned that Dr. Feffer had been more positive than TICHBORN's doctor in New York that TICHBORN does not have a ruptured disc. Dr. Feffer recommended physical therapy

# SECRET'

exercises varying somewhat from those prescribed by TICHBORN's Now Vark doctor. TICHEORN said that his back pains him toward the end of the day. Dr. Feffer opined that this condition should be cleared up within three months.

4. TICHEORN appeared to be in excellent spirits at the luncheon. He was very enthusiastic about movie deals as a substantial part of his cover arrangements. He obviously is at home in this field and believes it will give cxcellent access to operation targets in Spain. TICHBORN has contacts in the U. S. movie industry, one of whom is a friend interested in making a movie in Spain. TICHBORN plans to meet this friend Lend and other contacts in Los Angeles the first week of July.

5. At the request of EUR/IB/Spain, the undersigned asked TICHBORN to be available in Washington, D. C. during the period 8-10 July 1968 to meet the contract agent whom TICHBORN will be replacing in Spain. TICHBORN agreed to do so and also to stay loose later in July for conversation with the Deputy Chief of Station, Madrid.

6. The undersigned informed TICHBORN that from the cover point of view, it would be desirable for TICHBORN; enroute to Spain, to view the operation of WUBRINY/E. in Greece. While there, we would like TICHBORN to assess a Greek whom WUBRINY/1 considers to have good operational potential.

7. TIGHBORN said that he has not received a reply from the IRS to his request for a copy of his 1966 Income tax return (requested by C/DO/Pers). TICHBORN said that he is, therefore, writing another letter.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, EUR/IB/Spain

SUBJECT : Project WUBRINY - Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

1. Forwarded herewith is the revised proposal from WUBRINY/1 to Edward G. TICHBORN (P) covering the latter's assignment to Spain. It differs from the original in that the journalistic feature is dropped in favor of strictly commercial endeavors. Added is the possibility of developing a movie deal for submission to investors.

2. TICHBORN had two meetings with QUSALT/1, both of which went well from the cover point of view. The first meeting involved TICHBORN and QUSALT/1, while TICHBORN brought his wife for the second in which QUSALT/1 was wined and dined. TICHBORN said that QUSALT/1 is all in favor of TICHBORN's proposed assignment. However, in view of past WUSALINE/Iberia inactivity, QUSALT/1 has an attitude of "I will believe it when I see it."
   QUSALT/1 was particularly intrigued with the possibility of a movie deal and said that Spain is by far the cheapest place to make movies.

3. The one disquieting feature of the meetings with QUSALT/1 concerned TICHBORN's wife. She took the occasion to query QUSALT/1 on all aspects of living in Spain. All went well until the subject of health came up. QUSALT/1 commented that everyone should expect to get hepatitis and said that he had a severe case. This comment shook TICHBORN's wife whose best friend in Mexico caught hepatitis and whose children subsequently got it.

4. The undersigned specifically asked TICHBORN if his wife's concern with hepatitis posed the possibility of a refusal to accompany him. TICHBORN said that he thought not, but that he was going to drop the matter for a week. The undersigned stressed to TICHBORN that the Agency views his assignment as very important as

evidenced by the favorable terms offered him. We have
done considerable staff work on his assignment and don't
have another suitable candidate immediately available.
Should TICHBORN not be able to go to Spain, it would be
a severe blow. TICHBORN said that he appreciates our
position and did not see any reason to worry. The under-
signed said that we are preparing a contract for TICHBORN
and would like to make it for at least three years.
TICHBORN agreed, saying that he too prefers a long-term
contract.

MEMORANDUM FOR: CI/OA

SUBJECT: Edvard G. TICHBORN (P), 201-253203
Amendment of OA

1. European Division, with the cooperation of Domestic Operations Division, plans to assign Edward G. TICHBORN to Madrid, Spain under deep cover on a PCS basis in late summer of 1968.

2. Since October 1966, TICHBORN has been in the DO Division, working as a legal line case officer for proprietary WUSALINE in New York. In late June and early July TICHBORN TDY to Madrid to assess access to priority targets in Spain which might be provided by the WUSALINE Spanish affiliate, WUSALINL/Iberia. The results of this trip indicated that such access did exist and could be exploited by the assignment of a qualified officer as the VUSALINE representative in WUSALINE/Iberia. This assignment was offered to TICHBORN in the summer of 1967 but he was unable to accept it for personal reasons at that time. TICHBORN is now available for the assignment and we hope to place him in Madrid by September 1968.

3. TICHBORN's new assignment will involve the following operational duties:

a. To identify, cultivate, and acquire intelligence from those individuals and groups within Spain who now play, and can be expected to play in the post-Franco period, a significant role in determining Spanish domestic and foreign policy.

b. To spot and assess individuals within the above group for possible recruitment by other Station assets

4. It. is not anticipated that TICHBORN himself will attempt recruitments nor that he will be required to break his cover. Contact with the Madrid Station will be maintained under secure conditions at all times.

5. Upon his assignment to Spain, TICHBORN will fall under the operational and administrative control of Europe Division. Do Division will provide cover support. He will be supported under Project QUBLOOM.

# MEMORANDUM FOR: RECORD

## SUBJECT: Project WUBRINY - Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

1.  The undersigned met with TICHBORN at 1630 hours on 19 May 1968 at the undersigned's room in the Shorcham Hotel, 33 West Ah Street, New York City. TICHBORN was still suffering from an injured disc and either stood or-lay down on the bed during the course of the meeting. He sald that he had been fitted for a back harness which he would get the following day. If his back did not improve with the harness, going into traction would be necessary. TICHBORN said that his back injury occurred when a bench on which he was sitting in the laundry room of his apartment collapsed. He said that he is meeting with a representative of the insurance company with which his apartment owner is insured to seek compensation. He had previously asked for and was mailed a list of benefits under his Acy hospitalization policy. TICHBORN can sit down, but sitting, it is very painful for him to get up.

2.  Per agreement with Chief, EUR/I/Spain, the undersigned offered TICHBORN a fee of $25,000 out of which TICHBORN will have to pay his own housing and educational expenses. Inasmuch as the normal housing allowance for Spain 1s $3,680.00 a year and the educational allowance for two children $1,120.00 or higher, the offer to TICHBORN amounts to a $20,000 base salary. TICHBORN was informed that additional benefits outside his basic Tee would include:-

a. Round-trip transportation less than first-class for him and his family to Spain and return to New York,

b. Cost of shipping and storage of household effects,

c. Temporary Lodging allowance of $9 per day per adult and children over 11 up to 90 days with an additional $5 per day per child if the lodging has no kitchen facilities (TICHBORN has two children, a boy age 13 and a girl age 11).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

d. Transportation allowance of $50 per month,

e. Oional expenses

TICHONrsatisfied with his basic fee, commenting that I better than Mexico. He then added that mey do mean as much to him as it did, because to agent s that TICHBORN's book will be a good selur end arn a lot of money. TICHBORN opined that temporary lodging and transportation allowances arrow. The under- signed pointed out that these allowes are applicable to staff employees and that they have been found adequate.

3. The undersigned noted that TICHBORN, by virtue of his association with WUSALINE and WUSALIFY and his 1967 trip to Spain, is in an excellent cover position for this assignment. He has also had the opportunity to meet the Agency representative In Madrie with whom he will be dealing. The undersigned a TICHBORNa copy of WUBRINY/l's letter outlining ICORN's cover assignment (unamended copy attached. The undersigned noted that the senior officer of the firm participating with WUSALINE in WUSALINE/Iberia in late 1966 had suggested that a developer of new business be obtained. This overture was followed by TICHBORN's exploratory trip in June 1967. Subsequently, a WUSALIFY company for which TICHBORN is a legal consultant, followed up on TICORN's trip by sending a geologist to assess several abandoned silver properties. In this way, the stage should be weil Jet for TICHBORN as outlined in the cover letter prepared by WUBRINY/1.

4. At 1800 hours, WUBRINY/1 and WUBRINY/1l joined the meeting to discuss cover arrangements. The under- signed emphasized that the arrangement would not only have to be plausible, but, in due course, there would have to be commercial results. TICHBORN was also em- phatic on this point. He suggested that the cover letter also include the possibility of putting together a movie deal. TICHBORN said that he is thoroughly at home in the movie field and finds it a good access to targets of operational interest. WUBRINY/l seized eagerly upon TICHBORN'g suggestion, stating that he had always wanted to finance a movie deal. WEBRINY/1 said that he


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 54

would amerid the cover letter to include this possibility. Both the undersigned and WUBRINY/1 stressed the importance of TICHBORN's obtaining U. S. clients to represent in Spain. Some further training for TICHBORN was recommended by WUBRINY/1, including visits to certain WUSALINE affiliates. The undersigned concurred, stating that a visit to WUSALINE's affiliate in Greece would be particularly useful because TICHBORN might also do an assessment there on a Greek associated with WUSALINE's affiliate.

5. WUBRINY/1 said that QUSALT/1 is coming to the U. S. the third or fourth week in May 1968. It was agreed that WUBRINY/1 and TICHBORN would gear up to get QUSALT/1's endorsement of TICHBORN developing business for WUSALINE/Iberia.

6. Both TICHBORN and the undersigned informed WUBRINY/1 that employment terms have been agreed upon and opined that these terms might be more liberal than WUBRINY/1 would privately extend. The undersigned sald that the Agency would embody TICHBORN's employment terms in a contract from which commercial terms could be drawn. The undersigned added that all of the funding of TICHBORN would not necessarily have to be accomplished through WUERINY/1.

7. TICHBORN owes the Agency $199.99 on an old loan. TICHBORN promised faithfully to send the undersigned a check in this amount prior te 31 May 1968.

8. The Covert Tax Unit desires a certified copy of TICHBORN's income tax filing for 1966. TICH PORN said that he had been unable to locate one and had asked the IRS for a copy.

9. TICH BORN's wife is concerned about schools in Spain. The undersigned gave TICHBORN information on schools in Spain as obtained from EUR/I/Spain and from a friend who spent three years in Spain.

10. TICHBORN said that he would like to go alone to Spain in August so to be able to make arrangements in advance for s is tamily.

270 PARK AVENUE
NEW YORK, N.Y. 10022

May 15, 1968

Henry P. Lopez, Esq.
8900 Arlington Avenue
New York, N.Y.

Dear Henry,

I have carefully considered your most interesting idea of activating our relationship in Madrid.

Your operations with us here have been entirely satisfactory from our standpoint, and indeed, the volume of client business that you have been able to develop exceeded our expectations. On the other hand you say that some of these clients will follow you to Spain, and it would appear that the market in Spain for consulting services is somewhat less competitive than is the case here, so the eventual prospects could be good.

As you may know, our operation in Athens, which has worked out extremely well (although it involved a lot of hard work and trouble) came about in just the same way; after a year or so in the office here George Economakis one day suggested that we might be able to start a similar operation in Athens, to which we eventually agreed; it has all grown from there, and is now a most satisfactory business.

In considering your idea I have thought of two categories into which your work might be divided: ideas which can be done through the medium of ICAP services, which certainly needs riding up, and things which we do separately from it, and may take up each category in turn.

1. Operations for ICAP Iberia:

I reviewed the joint venture with DATP. S.A. under the name of ICAP Iberia; the understanding was that we see a serious long-term effort to get business for them, plus systematic prospection on their behalf of new clients.

To date we have not found it possible to carry out

201213203


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 57

SCAP CORPORATION

- 2 -

this prospection owing to budgetary limitations and a lack of spare time. Also, the other ICAP offices abroad have been too busy with their own affairs to think too much about getting business for each other.

As you may know, part of the original idea was that George Train would carry out this representative function with the American business community, but in the event, he developed a close relation with a Spanish bank, and devoted most of his available time to their concerns.

ENTF has become restive as a result, and in fact yesterday I received a letter from them which raises the issue of winding up the arrangement.

The first activity, therefore, which feel you could most advantageously carry out on our behalf in Spain would be that of seeking new business for ICAP Iberia. After an initial familiarization with the work of the office, I would suggest that you might call on the U.S. firms operating in Madrid and offer the services of ICAP Iberia. You can get a list of such firms through the Department of Commerce. There is also an American Club in Madrid (of which George Train was a founder) whose members would certainly be appropriate for such prospection.

After you have prospected the American business community, you could go on to the European firms operating in Spain, in the same way.

I-doubt if ICAP Iberia has the time of such extensive prospection, so your work here would be valuable to them, I would think.

Another related area in which your services could be of help would be in helping in client relationships with U.S. clients that have begun working with ICAP Iberia or BANIF or are on the point of doing so.

To the extent that your existing Latin American or U.S. clients would need your services in Spain, you would naturally want to have prime responsibility for their affairs yourself. You would want to determine which of their needs could best be served by ICP Iberia, using BANIP S.A. and other possible sources of support, and which you should handle separately or through New york


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

# ICAP CORPORATION

-3-

As you know, ICAP Corporation and BANIF own approxi-mately equal shares of ICAP Iberia. ICAP Iberia, in turn, gives first refusal on all consulting work to BANIF, but receives what acounts to a 30s override on such work. In other words, cur indirect interest in consulting work which we get for BANIF through ICAP Iberia is 15%, which comes off the top.

We would be pleased to alocate to you a share in our interest in any such work brought in through your efforts (and recognized for fee purposes by ICAP Iberia and BANIF) as follows: 7% (i.e., half of our indirect interest) of all fees during the first year after the actual commencement of billings for each client; 5% during the second, year; and 2% of all subsequent business.

Another sector where you could work directly with ICAP Iberia is related to the foregoing, and is simply U.S. law. To the extent that you could provide an in-house U.S. legal capability for them, particularly with respect to U.S. corporate practice and tax matters, I am sure this would be helpful.

Finally, correspondence is essential to inter-national business. We do not hear from our Spanish friends as we do from George Economakis or Giovanni Manes. The result is that we do not know what is going on in Spain, and do not have them on our minds. I am sure that if you were there you would keep us informed of opportunities, and as a result we could do a more effective job for them. In addition, you could act as the point of liaison between ICAP Iberia and the other ICAP affiliates.

(This would of course involve your knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the other ICAPS, so as a first order of business I would request that you spend two or three weeks in ICO Hellas, ICAP Italia and on a general prospection in France, Germany, and Benelux.)

2. Activities outside of ICAP Iberia.

By far the most important of these is generating a placement, capability for investment opportunities developed by ICAP Iberia. I do not think we expected when we started ICAP Hellas that the most important figure in this company would be one who was not even on the masthead at that time, namely Tony Lykiardopulo. The really profitable side of our business is, as you know, the entrepreneurial one, not the professional one.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 59

ICAP CORPORATION

- 4 -

It is fine to have good ideas and to carry out thorough feasibility studies, but if you do not have a client who will go into these plans, they will not do you much good. Until Tony came along, ICAP Hellas did four or five studies a year for their own account, which they did not consummate. Now they seem to be in about the same position we are, which is that before we proceed with the full study we have sold the deal, and the study is mostly by way of documentation and background. Most investors come in on our say-so on the telephone, not in response to any documents. Tony has this power, and the Others in ICAP Hellas, for some reason, generally do not. If you personally could carefully study every aspect of deals that BANIF might work up, and then present then to individuals whom we might suggest, there is a fair chance that we can do a real job of merchandising, which we can never do on writeups.

The second capability you might be able to develop for us outside the ICAP Iberia channels is related to the foregoing, namely to generate securities business for this office, just as Tony Lykiardopulo does. Our Special Account has the best performance record of any readily available investment medium that a foreigner is likely to see, and it has been getting better as time has gone on. It makes an excellent. illustration of our capabilities in the investment management line. You would not be required to actually place our services with individual investors whom you might neet, but if you could identify them, and determine their needs in a preliminary way, on one of my periodic trips I could discuss our operation with them, and in the course of time there is little doubt that we would develop a slowly growing clientele. In addition, Tony Lykiardopulo can come to Madrid from time to time and maintain contact. Alternatively, you might eventually discover a customer's man in a brokerage house who would like to join us in the rather more elegant world of investment counsel, and we could make an arrangement directly with him.

You have spoken from time to time of your desire to increase the proportionate amount of time which you spend on creative writing and your interest in collaborating on a book on the "Establishment" in Spain, which in fact I agree with you... is a fascinating subject that I have never seen well written up. Certainly, there is no case I know of where a quite tightly-knit aristocracy (or oligarchy) really runs things the way it does there. Anyway, making contact with some of the figures in that group could certainly tie in nicely with the various activities mentioned above.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 60

ICAP CORPORATION

- 5 -

Finally, of course, we have your existing clients and their various interests in Spain, to which you have referred. You would need to allocate your time between these various activities as at present, letting us know where we stood.

All in all, it adds up, in my opinion, to a workable package, with, I would say, perhaps even more upside potential than the arrangements under which we are operating in New York now.

After consultation with our directors, therefore, I am happy to tell you that we are willing, in principle, to go ahead with this plan, and to negotiate a detailed understanding at your convenience.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, DO

VIA : Chief, DO/CO

SUBJECT : Eduard G. Tichborn (P)

1. The undersigned on 23 May 1957 reviewed in WH Division Tichborn's 201 file (4 Folders) and related operational files. Particular attention was given in this review to Tichborn's security.

2. The files reflect that Tichborn is very security conscious. There is no evidence that Tichborn was ever suspected of being a WOFACT operative.

3. Tichborn practiced law in California and was active in state and national politics. He was recruited as a political advisor on a part-time basis in 1950 by the CA Staff. In 1952 he was taken on full-time under contract by WH Division and assigned to Mexico City. His cover for this assignment was publishing and movie interests in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. In Mexico City he published a magazine, Dialogos, aimed at left-wing intellectuals. The CI/OA staff review in 1955 stated that Tichborn's cover story was completely accepted by his friends and associates. The SCS/WH of Tichborn in 1955 revealed that he had informed only his wife of his association with WOFACT.

4. The files reflect that Tichborn is very sensitive about security. He balked at working with a WOFACT officer in Mexico City, because a friend told Tichborn that the WOFACT officer not only was WOFACT but had openly admitted it to the friend. A proposed trip to Bolivia was aborted because Tichborn felt there was no suitable cover.

5. Tichborn has traveled extensively in Latin America on training and election assignments. Three countries in which he worked are Chile, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. On these assignments Tichborn used his legal, publishing, and movie cover. It is understood that he also used aliases and disguises, although this was not noted in the quick review of the files. He can, of course, be debriefed in detail on this aspect.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 63

6. The files show that Tichborn's magazine, *Dialogos*, was funded through Tichborn by various individuals through payments made by CCS. The AC/WH/6 interrogated Tichborn on any Foundation funding. Tichborn could recall only one instance of Foundation funding, some $2-2,500 given *Dialogos* editor Susan Mirnu by the Fairfield Foundation. There is also a reference in the files that one, Louis Mercier, was informed that ODACID also supported *Dialogos*.

7. The files reflect very favorably on Tichborn's performance -- two reports by the Mexican Station and one from COS/Santo Domingo are not too commendatory. On the negative side, administrative details bore him.

8. The undersigned has confirmed with Chief, WH/CA that if DO will take over Tichborn's contract, WH will pay Tichborn's salary and expenses for the first quarter of FY 1958. Chief, WH/CA is awaiting DO's decision.

9. The undersigned is very favorably impressed by Tichborn. By 1 October, it is believed that Tichborn will be sufficiently well-trained in commercial and investment banking matters to do local-business consulting on a fee basis for WUSALINE. He should be able, depending on the number of operational requirements, to earn a part, if not all, of his salary. On this basis, it is recommended that DO resume administration of Tichborn effective 1 July 1958, with the understanding that WH Division will defray Tichborn's salary and expenses during the first quarter of FY 1958.

Reference: OSMA-233530, 11 January 1968

Action: Your comments are requested.

1. We regret our delay in responding to Reference and preceeding correspondence on this case. We will attempt below to answer the questions posed and comment where pertinent, keyed to paragraph 2 of Reference.

a. MUSALINS Iberia can, in principle, be used as an information collection mechanism. The type of requirements to be levied via FUSALINE would have to be consistent with that organization's past and present dealings with MUSALINE Iberia, i.e. commercially logical and feasible. Operating on this assumption, we believe that both general and specific requests for information could be levied and could cover a wide range of economic and commercial topics. We solicit your ideas on such requirements.

b. This subject was investigated with TICHBORN during a visit he made to Headquarters during the week of 29 January 1968. There seems to be little doubt that TICHBORN could obtain the necessary interviews, write an article, and have it published in a publication such as Life International. In considering this proposition, however, we wonder just what a trip would accomplish. To foresee that TICHBORN would obtain biographic and limited assessment data on certain high-level economic figures. He might also obtain some positive intelli-gence information by elicitation. But, given TICHBORN's background and talents, the most important gain, especially should a favorable article subsequently appear in print, would be in his establishment of viable personal contact with those persons interviewed. Therein lies the problem, that of transferring the relationship established by TICHBORN to someone else in the Station. We feel that you will agree that this is a difficult thing to do. In short, will the benefit to us from a short (possibly two/three weeks) foray by TICHBORN be worth the

necessary investment in time, money and effort. Included in the latter would be Chief/LOLACE approval. Such approval always requires solid operational justification and such justification could be especially necessary in this case, due to the probabio publication' outlet involved, Lifo International. Te are inclined to thin. that such a trip would not to worth it, uniess, and this is a possibility ciscussed below in paragraph 2, TICHEORY were to bo assigned PCS to Spain for a period of a year or more.

c. Also discussed with TICHIDORN Curang lis recent visit was the subject of his contacts with Spaniards in his hose city and of his use in assessing and developing visiting Spanish contacts of tho Station who might to steered to bin. In the former category, vo deterainod that TICIDORN LBS not yet been active in taking o contacts but would to villing to do so, on a celected basis.

Unless the Station has some specific cardidates in mind, we boliove the most profit to be tad from this exercise initially, would be to givo TICINORII the task of asscabling a spotting report on Spanierds in his bose city engaged in commercial activities to whom, presumably, TICHDORA του10 be able to logically develop access.

We would to perfectly wiilies to consider using TICEDORA in this way provided the targets vere care- fully selected and could be steered to TICKBORN without endangering Lis cover.

d. In answer to paragraph 2d of the Reference, we are forsarding under separage cover copies of the reports which TILBORN sataittod to Headquarters after his return. We can find no indication that these were sent to you at the time, although that was our intention. In any event, they appear to constitute additional detail to verbal reports provided to the Station by TICESORN thilo he was thera last yoar..

2. As the Station notes, the question of a PCS assignment to Madrid for TICKBORN was Ghelved last year due to a variety of reasons, both personal and professicant. Recent discussions with BOPLAY, Lovever, indicate that such an assignment should not be ruled out. It is possible that TICHE would bo available for PCS assignment to Spain in 1959, assuming that suitable cover arrangments can be worked out. In this regard, his assignment to Eadrid en s'

Judging from his performance there it appears that he would be a valuable addition to the Station effort against the unilaterial target, if he were to be assigned to Spain. His utility here, or on a brief TOY assignment from here is, we feel, far less and can only be taken advantage of by a realistic selection of any tasks we may ask him to perform. There is little doubt that he can meet Spaniards of interest, the problem lies in how to follow up at long range, of how to transfer a relationship established by TICHBORN to someone else who could take operational advantage of it. Otherwise, we will end up with a long list of cases and little else. On this basic point, a summation of the specific items dealt with above, we would welcome an exchange of views with the Station.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Land Development Project - Valencia, Venezuela

1. Contract Agent Edward G. TICHBORN (P) under Project WUBRINY has a major role in subject project which is being developed by a consortium of private and Venezuelan businessmen who have retained TICHBORN's services. The two principal Venezuelans involved financially in this project are Luis Ramon Bigott and Pablo Henning. Through these individuals, either socially or on a professional basis, TICHBORN has access to:

a. Eugenio Mendoza - businessman

b. Pedro Tinoco - lawyer and advisor to IBEC and David Rockefeller.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief/E/IB/S

SUBJECT: Project WUBRINY - Possiblo Operational
Support of Madrid Station Objectivos by
Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

REFERENCE: OSMA 23, 350 Dated 11 January 1968

1. Per Mr. Long's roquest, the undersigned on 30 January 1968
   discussed Ath Edward G. TICHBORN (P) possible support of Madrid
   Station objectives as raised in ref. It was confirmed that:

a. WUSALINE/Iberia can be used as an information collection
mechaniem in cases where information requirements can be couched
In plausible economic and commercial terms for contractual surveys.

b. TICHBORN en assess and develop selected Spanish contacts
of Madrid Station who may be visiting New York and who desiro
Introductions in US commercial circles.

c. TICHBORN can develop Spaniards in New York as may be
of operational interest to the Madrid Station. TICHBORN has not
made an effort to develop Spaniards In New York but is willing and
able to do so for any designated as operational targets. If desired,
TICHBORN thinks he can meet the Spanish Ambassador to the U. 5.
through a filend, Senator Jose Montoya of New Mexico.

d. TICHBORN feels that he could write an article concerning
leading Spanish industrialists and bankers for publishing in a pro-
minent publication, such as "Life International," TICHBORN
believes that he has excellent bonafides for such a task because
he previously published in "Life International" a four-page spread
on birth control in Latin America. This article was favorably
reviewed, TICHBORN suggested a related article on the popula
Hion explosion in Europe and its effect on business as a possible
topic for interviewing leading Spanish businessmen. TICHBORN,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 72

as a result of journalistic collaboration with Katherine Anne Porter, is représented in New York by a top literary agent, Monica McCall. TIGHBORN thinks that it would take him two to three weeks in Spain interviewing top Spanish industrialista and bankers. He would send letters in advance to these targets informing them of his proposed itinerary, the purpose of hie trip, and enclosing copies of his previous articles with favor- able reviewer comments. He could be essentially a free lance journalist or have a business purpose as well. In the latter connection, it is of interest that following TICHBORN's trip to Spain, WUBRINY/1 sent a geologist to WUSALINE/Iberia to look into acquisition of silver properties in Spain. This purely com- mercial development appears to be a direct result of TICHBORN'S trip and thus enhances TICHBORN's commercial bonafide

2. It is understood that E/IB/S has a copy of TICHBORN's report for dispatch to the Madrid Station por ref.

3. Personnel concerned with Project WUBRINY will be glad to work with E/IB/S in any follow-up to the possibilities noted above.

# DISPATCH

TO:
Chief, European Division

FROM:
Chief of Station, MadridSGR.

SUBJECT:
Operational/Edward G. TIGHBORN Trip to Madrid

Reference: OSMA 22,778

1. Madrid has awaited a report of TICHBORN's trip to Spain and some response to the various proposals made in Reference Dispatch. SHERIDAN carried back the message that TICHBORN would not be assigned PCS to Madrid as suggested he might be in DIR 32794. We have a high opinion of TICHBORN's talents, so this was a disappointment.

2. Regarding the proposals we made about how TICHEORN might continue to be useful in his target "Study on Dynamics of Spain As an Economic Entity" (see DIR 13385), there are several that we would like Headquarters to review:

a. Can WUSALINE Iberis be used as an information collection mechanism?

b. Has further thought been given to TICHBORN's writing an article (possibly for "Life International") on leading Spanish industrialists and bankers?

c. Can TICHBORN develop Spaniards in his home city for Madrid Station? Can the Station ask selected. Spanish contacts, who will be travelling to TICHBORN's city, to look up TICHBORN as a means of assessing and developing then?

d. IS TICHBORN preparing a report or contemplating any follow-up action to Reference trip?

3. Reference provides sufficient details to make all these questions clear. If Headquarters can give us a status report on the above questions and where we now stand with TICHBORN and WUSALINE, wẻ cần in turn make suggestions on how we believe TICHBORN's talents can be used in the future. As mentioned above, we have a high opinion of his ability and we hope we can benefit from it. In the meantime,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Project WUBYZAS Status Report

REFERENCE: Memorandum for hecord, dated 23 January 1968, Same Subject

1. Ref. noted that John A. BI ENKISOP (P) had suggested certain changes in his proposed contract and that these suggested changes had been referred to the OGC for comment.

2. Attached are the OGC comments on BLENKINSOP's suggested changes. In brief, the OGC stood firm on the proposed contract as written and rejected BLENKINSOP's suggested changes. One change suggested by BLENKINSOP, 1. e. to allow interim hotel expenses greater than $1000.00 in Instanbul, if necessary, was considered administrative by the OGC and left to DO for decision. In view of the rejection of BLENKINSOP's other suggested changes, it was decided to accept BLENKINCOP's request for interim hotel expenses to exceed $1000.00 if necessary. BLENKINSOP' suggested change reads "Barring extraordinary circumstances, these /expenses/ are not to exceed the amount of $1000.00." In his justification for this change, BLENKINSOP potius that time in transit for furniture could extend to six weeks and that in this case hotel expenses could be closer to $2000.00.

3. WUBRINY 11 was advised on 24 January 1968 of our position on the contract. He will relay it to WUBRINY 1 and/or BLENKINSOP. BLENKINSOP's reaction is awaited.

10 January 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR: RECORD

SUBJECT: Agreement with WUBRINY/1 to Defray a Portion of Edward G. TICHBORN's (P) $17,000 Annual Contract Fee

1. Chief, DOCO, DC/DOCO, Mr. Ed Welch, and the undersigned met on 3 January 1968 with WUBRINY/1 and WUBRINY/11. WUBRINY/1 had previously agreed in principle to buying a portion of TICHBORN's time. He was asked at the 3 January meeting to make a specific proposal on this matter. It was pointed out to WUBRINY/1 that the Agency does not have at this time any operational requirements for TICHBORN and that, ideally, TICHBORN's $17,000 annual contract fee would be offset completely by commercial fee income.

2. WUBRINY/l said that he is forming a development company in Venezuela for a land development project in which TICHBORN could be very useful the next six months. He proposed that the development company retain TICHBORN for six months at $5,000. If the project is continued, TICHBORN will be retained for a higher figure for the next six months plus a bonus if the project is successful. The company will, of course, also defray TICHBORN's expenses incurred on the land development project. For the Agency and Project WUBRINY, the agreement with WUBRINY/1 means that WUSALINE will expend $3,500 to retain TICHBORN for the next six months.

3. The Venezuelan Desk was advised that TICHBORN will be going to Venezuela on 10 January 1968 and will be spending considerable time there during the next six months. The Venezuelan Desk was very receptive to exploiting TICHBORN operationally and prepared a detailed cable for COS/Caracas. However, this proposed cable was modified by WH Division upper.

Dear Ismaeli:

Please forgive me for not having submitted my accounting sooner than this. As you know, I have been away from New York on several trips and my correspondence has accordingly fallen behind. Should there be any question concerning the data which you will find on the attached sheet, please let me know, and I shall be happy to submit any clarification you desire.

At the moment I am devoting all my time to the Sattelite City project in Venezuela, and have consequently let matters ride with respect to the Mexican border development program.

Please let me know when you are coming to New York, for I would like to take you to that wonderful Latino restaurant you mentioned in our recent phone conversation.

Un abrazo carinoso

Communication is the essence of what makes us human, and is a critical component in building understanding between people.  Through it, people come to know one another.  Effective communication leads to strong relationships.  A commitment to clear communication promotes team cohesion.  It also promotes the collection of ideas for consideration by others.

Communication is the cornerstone to project success.  It sets the stage and tone for any project, helps build team cohesion and collaboration, and creates an environment for open, honest, and proactive dialogue.

Consider the following when communicating with others:

*   Be aware of your nonverbal communication such as body language and facial expressions.

*   Be mindful of the words you choose.  Choose words that will be easily understood by your audience.

*   Be aware that your personal biases can unintentionally hinder effective communication.

*   Listen actively to the person speaking with you.

I. Can ICAE-DANIF serve our operational needs?

a) Present status:

As we all undoubtedly realize, our relations with DANIF have been rather loose and underdeveloped due to budgetary limitations. We have, in effect, a nice-sounding relationship called "ICAP IBERIA S.A." - with a rather impressive board of directors - but we have generated almost no business to date. As Miguel Echegaray so wryly observed: "After all, Hank, we've had less than $200 income for ICAP IBERIA, and that wouldn't even pay one day's overhead in this office." As a consequence of our limited business activity with their office, I doubt that ICAP figures very prominently in the over-all plans of the DANIF people. Nevertheless, they have explicitly stated that the ICAP-DANIF combination has considerable potential "if you in New York would devote a little more time and money to certain Spanish brokers". They apparently feel that we have access to American business firms who could actively engage in joint ventures with some of their Spanish clients - or that ICAP itself could invest therein.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

The BANIF people also feel that we choull be able to "reach" their clients for market surveys and feasibility studies. I've read two of their more impressive studies, and I'm inclined to believe that this particular suggestion has lose merit. With this thought in mind, I suggested that Echegaray cend me a copy of the study they did for Clin Mathieson, so that we might duplicate on the Xerox and thereafter show it to prospective cliente.

There should be a number of other ways in which we can strengthen cur ties with BANIF - all of them requiring time, effort and money - and I strongly suggest that we do so because I am also fairly well convinced that ICAP IBERIA (through its association with BANIF) can be developed into a viable channel to the target people. I discussed this at great length with our link representative in Madrid, and we have agreed: a) that there is a considerable operational need for close contact with the target businessmen, and b) that BANIF offers at least one channel to those people. (I'll discuss at least two other channels later on in this report.)

ICAP IBERIA -(BANIF) relationship

Most of the officers of BANIF are also officers of ICAP IBERIA S.A.. But I should like to discuss their background and contacts as they relate to BANIF.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

1. Miguel Echegaray:

Echegaray is the number-there man at EBIME?
and the person most directly involved of a CORP. FINANCE. He is generally a very pleasant and intelligent person, but if we should ever consider recruiting him for the bank, I would recommend against such a move. Aside from certain personal traits (a tendency to be a glutton - and general untidiness), Mike is often excessively outspoken and indiscreet. In a strongly-Catholic country he frequently blasts the Church without bothering to ascertain the religious inclinations of the person he's addressing - and his political views are bruited about with equal abandon. Furthermore, I have a feeling that Echegaray wants to get out of Spain and perhaps out of the investment business. Perhaps he's one of those perpetually-dissatisfied human beings who are always bitching about their jobs or resident countries - but never make the move - which is true?

2. Alvaro Alonso-Castrillo, Managing De Casa-Finance:

Although frankly skeptical about hiring Echegaray for the bank, I am intrigued with the notion of re- recruiting his colleague Alonso-Castrillo. As a permanent legal adviser to the Spanish Government at cabinet level (Juridico del Consejo de Estado), he is obviously


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 109

vindicate in the threats raize interested in. Moreover, the seems to have a penchance for a bit of intrigue. Sometime ago he acted as a "spy many" for George Brown, the labor leader, the man Alonso-Castrillo a large bundle of greencoats for certain Spontiards who were engaged in combatting corde influence in labor. And in recent years he has served as the "secretary" of the shadow cabinet of Don Juan de Bourbon, attending periodic meetings in Liston even though he "knows it's a lost cause." I rather suspect he would enjoy a little extra cash, but his principal reason for helping the bank would be the papyrological psychological satisfaction of being involved in something with an international flavor and political hanky-panky. In addition to his duties at EENIS, Alonso-Castrillo is a member of the board of directors of the following firms: Farmabim, S.A. (optional drugs), Feniberica, S.A. (antibiotics); Inmobiliaria Centro, S.A. (real estate), Artes Graficas Aron (painting). Artes Graficas Clavileno (printing).

He's a lawyer with a taste for scholarly pursuits as evidenced by his having worked for Master's Degrees in International law at Madrid and at Paris University. Moreover, he's an associate professor of international law at the University of Madrid and has published several books and articles.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

I was unfortunate toly unable to get such of a "line" on this gentleman. During my several visits to BWIFF he was heavily involved in negotiating what Echegaray characterized as "a very big and complicated deal with some French and American financiers." In any event, we saw each other only briefly - but I got the impression that ICAP-IBERIA has not developed sufficiently to engage his interest.

For the record we might note that Ruiz de Alda is on the board of directors of the following firms:

Algodonera de Castilla S.A. (cotton ginning), Energia e Industrias Aragonesas S.A. (power producer and chemical manufacturer), Hilatures Alda S.A. (a family company engaged in cotton spinning).

Echegaray informed me that Ruiz de alda has close personal ties with Luis Usera, managing director of Banco Hispano Americano; Alfonso Fierro, president of Banco Iberico; and Pedro Careaga Basaté, Conde del Cadagua, president of Banco Vizcaya.

### CASILDA USSIA FIGUEROA - [most useful friend]

One of Bob Rooney's chief associates is CASILDA USSIA FIGUEROA, a member of a distinguished family headed by Luis Ussia y Cavaldi, Conde de los Caftanes, the owner of Minero Siderurgica de Ponferrada. His company is listed as one of hundred largest enterprises in Spain.

As a preface to my remarks about Casilda, I should like to point out that I had previously met with George Train and Miguel Echegaray, and I had asked them to name some of the outstanding figures in banking, manufacturing, utilities, chemicals, construction, etc. Except for two or three of the better-known names, neither Train nor Echegaray seemed to have such information at the tip of the fingers, but they both took my previously-prepared check list of categories and volunteered to fill in the blanks during the next few days.

That same afternoon I dropped in at Bob Rooney's office and casually mentioned that I would like to identify Spain's top business leaders for a possible moonlighting-on-the-job-article for FORTUNE magazine. "Well, that's easy," said Bob, "My two associates know all about them." He then introduced me to Casilda Ussia Figueroa and Gloria de las Barcenas, both about 23 years old and quite attractive in their miniskirts.

Having glanced at my list, Bob said, "Would you please tell Senior Lopez the names of the leading bankers in Spain?"

Without a moment's hesitation, they named the ten leading banks.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 112

and then told me who owned or directed them, also adding such entities as "Alfonso and Iguala Tierto really have more say-so at the Banco Iberico than their brother Arturo" or "Don Ignacio Villalonga is rather old now, so Luis Escanez will probably take charge of the Banco Central pretty soon."

Then I asked about manufacturing, construction, food processing, automobiles and accessories, utilities, etc., they reeled off scores of names (plus intra-family marital connections) like two chatty IEM machines, not once referring to the several boxes of index cards they had previously prepared for Rooney.

After they had finished their amazing ad-lib performance, Bob and I checked the notes I had taken against the information listed in his "file of Spain's 500 outstanding business and society people," and they matched perfectly - not one error. I later checked their data with the information published in LAS PRIMERAS INFRESAS ESPANCLAS, edited by the Sociedad Editorial de Economia y Finanzas, and here again it proved correct in every respect.

At no time did Miguel Echegaray, Alerce Castrillo, George Train, Anthony Cefaratti (or anyone else I met) demonstrate such an encyclopaedic knowledge of names and businesses related thereto.

Aside from the conseration of future marital prospects, I simply can't imagine what has motivated these girls in their accumulation of such data but I was further flabbergasted by Casilda's English mind during the next several days. Soon after our initial meeting I escorted Casilda to a party given by


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

## Quixote Continued (2)

Quario Gonzalez, having both been invited to accompany one Rooneye. During the party she introduced me to twenty or thirty people, many of them friends of her family, and after each introduction she would give me a thumbnail sketch of the person we had just met: profession, family background, marital status, relatives, schooling, name-of-mistress, etc. On the following night she took me to a pre-dinner cocktail party at the home of Jaime Clozabal, whose family controls Kelvinator de Espana. There I met the Marquez de Casa Trepanes, Graciela Abelló (of the Abelló drug products clan), Juan Huarte (head of Huarte y Cia construction company), a playboy member of the Seneca family. Benito Perojo (an independent movie producer), Nabu Navarro de Zubillaga (young sculptress who is apparently a close friend of Princess Beatriz de Saboya), and an actress named Rosanna Vanni, who was accompanied by a young yeh-yeh playboy whose name was mumbled by Casilda. Incidentally, she speaks with a Madrileño lisp that is often confusing to my Mexican ear.

At the urging of CD (and with my willing assent), I spent considerable time and moola cultivating Casilda - dinner dance on Saturday, to the bullfights at Toledo with an American movie crowd, and a brief visit with Casilda and her off-and-on fiance in Paris, where he presumably studies at the Sorbonne. Casilda had planned to go to Paris for Institute Day (the Spanish ambassador, Carlos de Miranda Guar, is a family friend), and she suggested

Kaip ascustomed the would solve no extra pine fare.

advised re that a hartu drobably strengthen ties with Casilda, ki se both feel will prove to be a Valueble source of information. dis Juring my brief stay in Phos I realized that she was probably "cultivating" for a very specific purpose: the materral (Figuerca) side of her family has some silver times watch have not been in production since the Civil War, and Bob Rooney had told her that I rep-resented a group of New York investors winc are looking for silver properties. She reached the subject on the day I loft Paris, and I asked her to forward any and all avallatio information on the said aines. If, in fact, the Figueroas do have economically-crerable wines, we could then establish genuinely firm relations with the Ussias, Figueroas, Oricis,

In any event, I would suggest that we maintain close ties with Casilda Ussia Figuerca and her friend Gloria de las Barcenas.

IN THE IMMEDIATELY ARE HOW MOTIVES IN SPAIN

In the following paper is a list of the largest business enterprises in Spain and the names of the persons who own or control them. Whenever possible I have noted the *inmobiliario* for each company, bearing in mind that Spanish businessmen are not always totally candid in their financial statements. But aside from the accuracy or inaccuracy of these reports, one soon realizes that certain individuals and/or families control two or more of these companies and perhaps many others of lesser magnitude. And in my conversations with several Madrileños (Echegaray, Urbin, Alonso-Castrillo, Cef-arruuti, Carrigues, *et al*) some of these same names kept popping up time and again, thus leading me to conclude - at least tentatively - that the following individuals or families are the leading industrialists and financiers of Spain:

1.  Juan March Cervera
2.  Pedro Careaga Banabe, Conde del Cadagua
3.  Ignacio Villalonga Villalba, Marques de la Vega Inclan
4.  Alfonso Fierro - and brothers Ignacio and Arturo
5.  Jose Maria Oriol, Marques de Casa Briol
6.  Marques Delotiosa (Coman-acho family)
7.  Luis Urquijo y Landecho and other Urquijos
8.  Joaquin Reig Rodriguez
9.  Eduardo Angulo Orsolaurruchi

During our last session in Madrid, our bank representative and I discussed jointly the possibility and advisability of retaining Reuben Raskiny as a bank advisor on a part-time basis, and hire a public relations office which specializes in publicizing motion picture productions during the shooting phase.
And therefore has good contacts with producers, directors, actors, etc. In countries like Spain movie people are much sought-after by local businessmen and their spouses, and they frequently hobnob with the top echelons of society and government. (The Spanish government, incidentally, frequently subsidizes motion pictures which "portray the better aspects of our country.") Bob took me to a party hosted by Cesario Gonzalez, largest movie producer and distributor in Spain, and there I met the following: the Marques de Viesos de la Sierra (Banesto bank), Joaquin de la Riva (influential shipbuilding family), Florentino Ruyzalon (Madrid’s principal theatre owner), Tod Richman (producer of the Nell Bynner film), Lee J. Cobb, and several other people from Madrid’s rich-titled business community.
In addition to his open-handed publicity job, Rooney has another big asset: his wife, Patricia, who is the most beautiful and charming woman I can during my entire stay in Spain. Shying from the attention she received at the Gonzalez party, several of those upper-crust guests started to work.

7.guess that Barbara opens
Tay Coors For Rob. On one particular evening when I took
the Rooneys to impart of the Restaurants, we
wan into and Mrs. Pelipe Huarte (he's one of the
brothers who own Huante y Cia.one of Spain's largest con-
struction companies and a client of Bob's), and both the
Huartes gushed over Barbara and begged her to drop by for a
Sunday Brunch since Bob would be out of town on business.

I first met Rooney in Mexico City when he was handling
publicity for the production of VIVA MARIA, a movie starring
Brigitte Bardot and Jeanne Moreau. You may recall that I
interviewed Korean for DIALOGUES and was invited to spend several
days with the company when it went on location near Veracruz.
Well, during those few days Bob and I became rather close friends,
and I had a good opportunity to observe him under a variety
of circumstances, professional and otherwise... He's intelligent,
discreet, holds his liquor well, and has the kind of inquisitive-
ness that could be useful to the bank. He seems rather non-
political to me, but I would assume that he probably votes
Democratic.

Since he has just expanded his office, thereby increasing
his overhead; Bob would probably welcome some additional cash
and might therefore be amenable to recruitment. And, of course,
We must bear in mind that his two associates are Casilda Ussia
Figueroa and Gloria de las Barcenas, the two well-connected
women I have mentioned elsewhere. It would be most helpful.

"For us to have access ot Rooney's cross-referenced list of "Epata's 500 top business and society people," which was prepared for him by the aforementioned family handler."

CD has asked if I could approach Rooney to work for us, and I very emphatically pointed is cut that it would be much to risky. Is he should turn us down - or even if he should accept - I would be fully exposed to him and to some of our mutual friends. Consequently, I think he should be approached (If, indeed, we decide to do so) by someone totally unrelated to us or to ICAP.

### THE ZESE AND THE MANAGEMENT IN EUROPEAN COMPANIES IN CRISIS

THE INSTITUTO DE NOROTEC DE LA EMPRESA (Commonly known as IESE) is located in Barcelona and is a graduate school of the University of Navarra, which is directed by OPUS DEI.

The director of this most impressive organization is Professor Antonio Valero, who is also currently President of the European Association of Management Training Centers, of which IESE is an active member. The Institute's work is carried out in several directions: basic and applied research, management training and executive development programs, education in business management for university students, international programs, documentation and information services, etc. Moreover, most of IESE's professors are engaged independently as consultants to private firms.

Top management officials from all parts of Spain attend the annual seminars of the Institute, and there is little doubt that IESE is having and will continue to have a considerable influence in the business life of the country.

An indication of OPUS DEI's direct influence is the fact that the Institute's prospectus openly hopes that "IESE eliminate, diminish and its company 379000 affiliated with Banco de Financiacion company of the National Industrial Corporation".

Although many Spaniards are apt to characterize the OPUS DEI as "overrated," the businessman told me that "any young man who applies to Opus Dei will have a head-start in business."

note that JUAN MARCH
is probably the wealthiest and most influential industrialist in Spain..and I'm happy -- note that I might be able to meet him on a casual social basis through an old friend and Harvard classmate, PAUL DENNISON, formerly president of Esso Iberica (by Swift), Paul is now president of Elaz Nacional S.A., a subsidiary of Catalana de Gas y Electricidad, which is principally owned by JUAN MARCH. I spent considerable time with Paul during my brief stay in Barcelona and discovered (from certain remarks between him and an associate) that he has a close personal relationship with Juan and Bartolome March. He, in fact, offered to introduce me to Juan March on my next visit to Barcelona - probably for lunch or dinner. Moreover, Paul expressed great interest in my projected FORTUNE-style article on Spanish financiers and industrialists and has offered to advise me on the business capitan and to introduce me to some of his business friends in Barcelona and Madrid.

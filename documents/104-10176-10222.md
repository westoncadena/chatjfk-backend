1. Forwarded herewith for Headquarters information and files is an Agent Service Record on LIP ING-3.

2. As Addressees are aware, Wallace P. ROWTON recruited and formerly handled LIRING-3 for the Hexico City Station. Prior to ROHTON'S PCS departure from Mexico City in July 1969, it was deciced, after some discussion, to effect a turnover of LIRING-3, rather than terminate him. Although LIRING-3 apparently had been well "burned" with the Cubans, he seemed to have maintained good contacts with members of the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) of Guatemala. In addition, in May and June of this year, he had begun to develop access to some Panamanian revolutionaries of interest. It was therefore decided to rur LIRING-3 on a trial basis to determine whether he could be used effectively against Central American revolutionary targets, despite his problems with the Cubans.

3. ROWTON introduced Leonard S. TORMET, in alias, to LIRING-3 on 1 July 1969. Although ROWTON had represented himself to LIRING-3 as a Greek businessman, it was decided that it would be preferable to "clear the air" somewhat with LIRING-3, at least by making it

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

clear that he was in touch with a WOLADY organization. Nonetheless, no specific explaration was given LIRING-3 of his sponsor and he requested none. LIRING-3 was told that TORMET would be seeing him for some months, since ROWTON was leaving the country for an indefinite period.

4. LIRING-3 was told that although TORMET was trusted by ROWTON and collaborated with him, he represented a different organization. LIRING-3 was also told that although he had in the past been receiving between 3,000.00 and 3,500.00 Mexican pesos per month on an informal basis, TORMET's organization feit that 1,500 Mexican pesos per month ($120.00) would te a fair salary at this stage of the operation. TORMET explained that he was aware of LIRING-3's past activities directed against tre Cubans, and the resultant problems which had arisen. It was explained that TORMET'S interest was in Central American revolutionary activities. In order to deal with LIRING-3's virtua! "burnec" status with the Cubans, he was directed to tell any Central American contacts that the Cubans no longer trusted him, and that he therefore was no longer directly involved with any revolutionary groups or activities. Nonetheless, LIRING-3 was directed to offer any assistance which ne coula provice to any revolucionaries, on the basis oכוון ו leftist beliefs and the friendships which he had made with FAR members while in prison in Guatemala. It would then be a matter of time before we could learn whether LIRING-3 es complete blacklisted in all revolutionary circles because of his problems with the Cubans or whether he could provide information of value.

5. LIRING-3 throughout the meeting seemed in good spirits and he seemed to accept the turnover without any qualms. Indeed, he pointed out that the Cubans had lost trust in him only after he had been given various tasks to do by RUWTON which he had known and warned in advance would cause suspicion. It was agreed that LIRING-3's troubles were not of his own making, but that at this stage all that could te done was to attempt to circumvent the existing problems.

6. LIRING-3 was given a Station non-attributable telephone number and false name to ask for (Identity) to set up meetings with TORMET. Only the meeting time was to be set by phone, and a prearranged pickup point was decided upon. It should be noted that TORMET'S QP vehicle was used for this first meeting with LIRING-3, which means it was of course exposed to LIRING-3.

7. Subsequent to this meeting, LIRING-3 never initiated contact with the Station. Although he might have lost the new telephone number he was given to use with TORMET, there is no Indication he ever again tried to call ROWTON, who was in Mexico for at least three weeks after the I July turnover to TORMET.

8. The Station assumes that for whatever reasons, LIRING-3 has in effect terminated himself. Given the nature of this case--the fact that LIRING-3 was denounced in Cuban official circles as a RVROCK agent, the fact that LIRING-3 in over two years was never very productive and now the apparent decision of LIRING-3 to break off contact--it has been decided to make no effort to reestablish contact with him.

24 September 1968

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORI)

FROM: WH/1 (Marvin Francis)

SUBJECT: 17 September 1968 discussion with DRISCOLL re LIRIDG/3 & LIRING/4.

PARTICIPANTS: DRISCOLL, KERBE, FRANCIS and Laurence PIPER (C/WII/2/G).

1. LIRING/4 is still very concerned about the imprisonment of LIRING/3. LIRING/4 will not travel to Cuba until she is assured of the safety TTDINC. L/3 has thoroughly discussed L/3 with L/4 and has pointed out the danger of attempting to intercede on L/3's behalf through business contacts, L/4 contacted the Cubans for assistance but they stated there was nothing they could do. They have assisted L/4 with small amounts of money. L/3 has devised an open code which he uses in letters to let L/4 know how he is. The letters are grim reading because L/3 keeps stating he is unable to hold out much longer. Fellow prisoners have warned L/4 not to let the Guats transfer him to another prison as this usually ends in the prisoner being shot "while escaping." One good result from the continued imprisonment of L/3 is that both he and L/4 are furthering their bona fides with the Cubans.

2. L/4 is in telephone contact with the Third Secretary of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala. He has made inquiries about L/3 with the Guats on behalf of Foreign Minister CARRILLO Flores. A few weeks ago (prior to the assasination of the U.S. Ambassador) the Third Secretary told L/4 there were three possibilities, the first which he considered out of the question was that L/3 would be shot, the second was that L/4 would come to trial and be released within a few weeks, and the third was that he would receive a sentence of two or three years. Just prior to departing Mexico on this current trip, DRISCOLL attempted to arrange a meet with L/4 in the usual means by slipping a typed note under her apartment door. She did not make the meeting. DRISCOLL later learned through phone tap material that she called the Cuban Embassy and informed them the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

- 2 -

Mexican authorities had notified her she was being fined 500 pesos. The purpose of the payment was not identified. Later she made a call from the Cuban Embassy which indicated she was staying there until she could get the funds to pay the Mexicans. DRISCOLL. therefore, concluded she had not returned to her apartment and did not get the note to make their meeting. DRISCOLL said SUAREZ (the visiting Cuba Cultural type) has a key to L/3's apartment and might see the note but would be unable to identify the sender since DRISCOLL uses a meaningless scool as a signature.

3. DRISCOLL now plans upon his return to Mexico to recontact L/4 to get the latest reading on L/3's status in Guatemala. If the Mexican Charge is unable to obtain L/3's release ir behalf of the Mexicans and if it appears he will be held indefinately, DRISCOLL wants to explore the possibility of our doing something to get L/3 out so the operation can become active again.

4. In the above regard L/3 was discussed with Mr. PIPER of the Guatemala desk. Mr. PIPER believed the Station has a high enough contact with the Guats (ESM:JOR/20-Presidents brother) to arrange to get L/3 and his Mexican compatriot out of prison and back to Mexico with a minimun security risk. DRISCOLL said he would initiate the cable upon his return to Mexico after he has talked with L/4. DRISCOLL felt he should possibly travel to Guatemala and have a preliminary meet with L/3 before Guat Station makes any all out effort to officially request L/3's release. If, after seeing L/3 DRISCOLL is satisfied that L/3 is still an ally and is willing to cooperate after his release then DRISCOLL believes we should attempt to have the Station intercede with ESMAJOR/20. Hopefully, ESMAJOR/ 20 will arrange the release so that all involved believe it has been done at the request and urging of the Mexican Government. DRISCOLL, however, would like L/3 and L/4 to believe he (DRISCOLL) had something to do with the release in order to raise his status with both for the sake of future operation- al tasks he will levy on them.

SUBJECT Organization of the Guatemalan Communist Party (PGT) in Mexico

ACQ Mexico, Mexico City (11 June 1971) FIELD NO. EMM-13,647

SOURCE A member of the PCN who has good contacts with Guatemalan Communists in Mexico. Much of the information which he has provided has proved accurate.

1. The highest-ranking body of the Guatemalan Communist Party (PGT) organization in Mexico is the "Delegation of the Central Committee." This body consists of Huberto Alvarado Arellano, Jose Alberto Cardosa Aguilar, and Jose Luis Balcarcel Ordonez. (Field Comment: CS-311/02978-70 (EM-12,183), from the same source as this report, reported on the makeup of the PGT organization in Mexico as of April 1970. Cardosa and Balcarcel made up the "Delegation of the Central Committee" at that time. TDCS-314/-71 (HGG- ), from a reliable source, provided the information that Alvarado, the third secretary of the PGT, planned to reside in Mexico for the immediate future.)

2. Balcarcel also heads the "Directive Committee" of the PGT organization in Mexico, which is responsible for determining what activities the local PGT organization will undertake and who will carry them out. The other members of the "Directive Committee" are Alfonso Solorzano, Fernando Goz, and Julio Rodriguez Aldana. (Source Comment: There has been no change in the membership of the "Directive Committee" since April 1970. Although Rodriguez occupies this leadership position, he has been relatively inactive in PGT affairs.)

3. There are currently two active cells under the guidance of the "Directive Committee:"

a. A "Propaganda Coll" headed by Carlos Cacoroz Luis, which also includes Solorzano and Horacio Landa Castaneda; and

b. A "Finance Coll" headed by Rodriguez, which also includes Elisa de Balcarcel, Mercedes de Poreyra, and Carlos Illesces Aguirre.

4. Ernesto Capanno del Vecchio, who was formerly a member of the "Finance Coll," now works directly under the "Directive Committee" and is not formally a member of the "Propaganda Cell," submitted his resignation from the FGT in April 1971. Raul Diaz Ramirez, who was also formerly a member of the "Propaganda Cell," has been temporarily separated, from active participation in the

b. "Romulo," who made at least one trip "cut of town" from 17 February to 2 April 1969 (possibly to Guatemala) during the period covered by ROWTON's reports, appears to belong to a faction of the Guatemalan FAR family disillusioned with PBRUMEN.

c. The only real service asked LIRING-3 by "Romulo" during the period under review was to put up an unidentified "comrade" scheduled to come to Mexico at a date which "Romulo" said he could not determine exactly. This "comrade" was not the young Guatemalan who dropped in on LIRING-3 for a couple of days mentioned in the report dated 25 April.

d. LIRING-3 continues to collect clear evidence that LIRING has done its best to denounce him as a suspicious element definitely not to be trusted (see reports dated 15 and 19 February).

3. Several attempts to tail "Romulo" did not produce particularly significant results. A pretext investigation of apartment 102 of Calle Coahuila, where LIRING-3 met "Romulo" produced the results contained in the Spanish language report dated 26 February forwarded as attachment #2. There were no traces on the Ines XBASTON deX PIMENTEL family. *Sex: F* *Citi Mexico* *A: Mexico*

4. There is little question at this point that LIRING-3 is close to persona non grata with LIRING. Hence, his further usefulness against the PBRUMEN target is very limited. ROWTON has kept away from LIKEING-4 since LIRING-3's release from prison in Guatemala. Although LIRING-4, following her father's death (see MEXICO CITY-0125), may visit her mother in PBRUMEN, she has no particular love for LIRING or the PERUMEN authorities. On the Guatemalan side of this operation, the Station is, as it has done many times in the past, waiting for LIRING-3's Guatemalan contacts to make the next move.

ATTACHMENT #HMMA-37136

11 February, 1969

CONTACT REFCAT

1. Agent: LIRING/3

2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1100, 11/2/69; Cazino Real

3. Next Meeting: 1000, 14/2/69; same place.

4. Reports/Information Submitted by Agent:

LIRING/3 told Rowton that there had been little or no developments since he last saw Rowton (21/1/69), just before Rowton had left on his business trip to Monterrey. He commented that he had felt it wiser not to take any initiative in seeking out his FAR friends or revisiting the LIRING office until Rowton had returned. He stated that his old Guatemalan friend, Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla, had called on him once in the company of Carlos Vega, but nothing significant had emerged from the casual conversation. Vega, at several points in the conversation, had mumbled something to Rodriguez about the "crisis" but neither gave an explanation. L/3 told Rowton that he assumed that this remark referred to the current factionalism in the Guatemalan revolutionary struggle.

LIRING/3 then identified the attached photo of Mario Augusto Mendez Aguilar immediately at the first glance as that of "Romulo", aka "Mario Mendez" and "Pavel." LIRING/3 did not recognize the photo Rowton showed him of Mario Otoniel Mendez Molina.

5. Guidance/Information Given to Agent:

Rowton told L/3 that according to the very sketchy information he had concerning Mario Augusto Mendez Aguilar it appeared that the latter belonged to a strongly anti-PBRUMEN faction and that this would perhaps explain the turn-about of the LIRINGs after he, L/3, had indicated to LIRING/9 that he was in contact with "Pavel."

Rowton urged L/3 to seek out "Rómulo" at the calle Coahuila 221 safe-house, and, failing this, to recontact Humberto González Vega at his home on calle Manzanillo, in the hope that the latter could arrange a recontact with Mendez.

CONTACT REPORT

14 February, 1969

1. Agent: LIRING/3
2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1000, 14/2/69; Camino Real Restaurant.
3. Next Meeting: 1100, 15/2/69; same place.
4. ADMINISTRATIVE: LIRING/3 told Roxton that his friend, Berta Wigisser has rented a furnished apartment that can be used by him and Roxton as a safehouse as soon as it is vacated by its present occupants. L/3 explained that these occupants are relatives of sra Wigisser who are visiting from Argentina but who are expected to return to their own country within the next ten days.
5. REPORTS/INFORMATION GIVEN BY AGENT:

L/3 told Roxton that "Rómulo" (whom he identified from a photo as Mario Augosto Mendez Aguilar) visited him at his home unannounced at about 2000 on 11 February and stayed until almost midnight.

According to L/3 Rómulo-apologized for not having seen L/3 for so long ( last date reported was 3/1/69) explaining that he was very busy. He then stated that he had recently seen and talked with Rodolfo Sandoval Alegría in the (Lucumberri)prison and was pleasantly surprised to learn that Sandoval knew 1/3 and spoke very highly of him. Rómulo then went on to say that he had known Sandoval many years and had actually been his deputy in Guatemala. Rómulo recalled that when he was last arrested (he explained parenthetically that he had been arrested four times in all) he was tortured in an effort to make him reveal the whereabouts of Sandoval. He claimed to 1/3 that he finally, to avoid execution, gave a false address- that of one of Sandoval's relatives.

1/3 told Roxton that he then took the occasion to tell Rómulo of the harrassment he was being subjected to by various persons whom he felt were being inspired by the Chief LIRING. 1/3 told Roxton that Rómulo then asked him what the false charges brought against him were. L/3 told Rómulo the truth, saying that he kept getting reports that he was regarded as a CFIRM agent. According to 1/3, Ró- mulo exclaimed that he should pay no attention to that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 26

2. 
sort of slander since the LIRING office was always trying to neutralize persons and groups not acting under their control. He added that the people who really count in the struggle were used to such nonsense and were aware of what the LIRINGS were up to. He added that as soon as Sandoval got out of prison he would "straighten some of those people out" since he was personally aware of 1/3's motives and activities before his trip to the border. When L/3 mentioned his contacts with Carlos Vega (always at the latter's initiative), Rómulo described him as "Pastelito, a very sectarian sneaky pro-LIRING bastard". He said he would like 1/3 to arrange a meeting with Vega so that he could burst in and confront him with the facts.

Regarding Humberto González Vega, Rómulo said that he was a good "elemento" and had suffered a great deal for the cause, but at the moment was more or less out of the picture. He saw no need for 1/3 to be in contact with him. When L/3 expressed a desire to have some way of contacting Rómulo, the latter promised to give him his home address as soon as he move to a better place. He explained that at the moment he was living in a furnished room.

At the end of the talk, when Rómulo asked when they could get together again, explaining that he might have to go down to Crizaba over the week-end, L/3 told Rowton that he made a date for 1900 on 14/2/69. 1/3 then suggested that they meet outside so as not to involve his wife (1/3 told Rowton that he did this so that Rowton would have a chance to observe Rómulo in some public place), and Rómulo agreed but said he had a better suggestion. He then stated that he knew a Mexican family very well and could arrange that they meet at their home and have dinner. He added that he might bring along a brother ("hermano") and would come by L/3's home at 1900 to pick him up. L/3 agreed, saying that he had no objection to the brother coming along.

1. Agent: LIRING/3
2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1100, 15/2/69; Camino Real restaurant.
3. Next Neeting: 1000, 19/2/69; same place.
4. Repcrts/Information Given by Agent:

LIRING, 3 reported that he met again with "Rózulo" but under circun-stances somewhat different from that anticipated. L/3 related that when he arrived at his apartment about 1850 The previous eveningin the company of his wife (after having dropped off his daughter at the homocis, se iouna a note irca "Romulo" asking his to meet him at apartment 102 of Calle Coahuila 200.

L/3 continued that since his wife was present when he read the note he felt he had to ask her to come along ( and in addition she had been upset that afternoon and did not want to be left alone ). They therefore both proceeded to the address given by Rmulo and found him there in the midst of a rather large number of persons, apparently of the same fazily residing in the apartment. after about fifteen minutes of social chatter, Rózulo suggested that they go to a nearby restaurant to talk more privately. Romulo then took L/3 and his wife to the restaurant Kuku at Calle Coahuila 223 where they had dinner. 1/3 told horton that because of his wife's presence he was not able to discuss anything sub-stantive with Romulo and had to leave the questions he wanted to ask him re FAR/BBRUNEN activites until a subsequent meeting. L/3 added that in the course of conversation, Romulo stated that Rodolfo Sandoval Alegría hoped to be released from prison in Farch, 1969. Romulo also stated that he worked in a newspaper office, but 1/3 felt he could not securely ask the name of the newspaper at that time.

L/3 told Roxton that Romulo agreed to another meeting on 18 Zebruary and asked L/3 to net him again at apartment 102 of Coahuila 200 shortly after 1900, inasmuch as he generally leaves his place of employment a little before that time. Romulo, 1/3 and his wife then took in a movie.

1/3 then told nowton that after he had left Roston the previous day he had another very disturbing experience (he appeared to Rowton nervous and suf-fering from lack of sleep). L/3 explained that when he dropped into the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana about 1300 on 14/2/69, he ran into an old friend, Fanny Ravel, a Mexican artist with whom he had worked very closely in PBRUMEN some years ago. L/; continued to Reaton that despite their


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

2. 
past friendship, Fanny Ravel treated him in an obvious cold manner.
L/3, feeling that he could not this pass unnoticed, got Fanny in the corner and asked what was up. The replied that for some time she had been hearing "disturbing reports" about 1/3. Under further questioning by 1/3 she specificl thatoriſinally, some 7-8 months previously she had been told by a LIZING official that L/3 "was not to be trusted". Fanny continued that she did not pay too much attention to this, since the official was rather "low-level", but core recently she was told the same thing by an "uzizpeachable source" and could not challenge it despite her high personal esteen for L/3.

1/3 commented to Roston that the "inimpeachable scurce" must be the Chief LIRING, inasmuch as Fanny Ravel as always been a close personal friend of his and possibly even one of his mistresses. 1/3 continued that LIRING had several sizes corrented to him (when 1/4 was working in the LIRING cffice) that Parny Ravel was infrequent telephone contact with the Chief.

5. GUIDANCE Given to Agent:

Rowton told L/3 that he was more convinced than ever that the LIRING office had mounted a slander operation against him because of his con- tacts with the Casillo Sanchez group (León Barrics brothers and Romulo) which PERUM was apparently attempting to isciate in their own interesi. Shen 1/3 appeared a little ccuscled at this, Rowton continued that he felt L/3 should, at the 18 Feb zeeting with "Rómulo", tell the latter that he knew the game the LIKINGS were up to and ask "Rómulo" point blank whether he knew to what extent the LIRING office was trying to sabotage FAR because of its nationalistic anti-FBRUKER position: Roxton asked L/3 to entice "Rótulo" into such a discussion in the hope that "Rómulo" would ask him, 1/3, to help discover any unilateral operations PBRUMEN night be planning. Reston continued that L/3 should tell Romulo that although he was virtually cut off from the LIRING office, he still had a great cany FEEUWEN friends (г.б.

) from whom he could possibly get useful information to help Romulo's faction. Roxton suggested that 1/3 could also propose to Homulo that they both put the squeeze on Carlos Vega (apparently a LIRING provocation) to ob- some preliminary information on the intentions of the HRING operation.

CONTACT REPORT

19 February, 1969

1. Agent: LIRING/3
2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1000, 19/2/69; Camino Real Restaurant.
3. Next Meeting: Same time, same place, 21/2/69.
4. Reports/Information Given by Agent:

LIRING/3 reported that "Romulo" appeared unannounced at his apartment on the late afternoon of 17/2/59 and consequently he did not go to meet him at apartment 102 of 200 Coahuila St. on 15/2/69 as originally planned. LIRING/3 told Howton that "Rómulo" promised to see him again about 1900 on 20/2/59, coming to pick him up at his apartment.

LIRING/3 then stated that on the morning of 17/2/69 he had into Godoy, the wife of Jorge, at Gobernación and was so disturbed at the cool reception that he looked up Jorge Godoy later that day to find out what was going on. Jorge Godoy was quite frank with him telling his that the LIRING office had advised his to keep clear of LIRING/3 because he was not to be trusted. Godoy continued that a LIRING official had told him that LIRING/3 was being used (perhaps unconsciously at first) by some counter-revolutionary organization and that the LIRING Office based it assertion on the following three points: (1) LIRING/3 had been in touch with a foreigner who pretended to be a businessman but who did not do any business with FEBCEN, (2) LIRING/3 had access to information that could come only from a police source (3) LIRING/3 was responsible for the arrest of Identity A and had undertaken the mission to Guatemala to get information against the revolution.

According to LIRING/3, Jorge Godoy told him that it was difficult to believe all this, especially in the light of 1/3's relatively long imprisonment, but he had to take it seriously in view of the source of the charges. 1/3 told Howton that he went over each point in rebuttal on a matter of principle despite the fact that Godoy's mind obviously was already made up.

LIRING/3 told Howton that when he talked later that day with "Romulo" he related what had happened with Godoy. "Rómulo" replied that those LIRING allegations were not to be taken seriously. He commented: "we have already looked into them and do not believe them." He explained that for one thing if 1/3 had been a spy he certainly would have continued (with the approval and connivance of the authorities) on up the mountains where he could get useful information, instead of permitting himself to be arrested just after stepping across the border. "Rómulo" agreed with 1/3 that the LIRING office


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

2. 
probably does not want 1/3 to help his ("Rómulos") faction and have done everything possible to isolate 1/3 from his normal social contacts. Rómulo added that the only important point in the whole affair was that there were "certain elements" among the Guatemalan revolutionaries that might believe the LIRING charges and possibly do harm to 1/3 and or his wife. Rómulo urged 1/3 "to be careful" and for that reason did not encourage the idea of a confrontation with Carlos Vega at this time. He continued that if, however, L/3 insisted he would be glad to have it out with Carlos Vega to find out who had sent him to provoke L/3. Rowton agreed that little or nothing could be accomplished in pursuing this matter.

L/3 continued that when he told Rómulo that he felt frustrated and helpless revolutionary, have courage and patience in confronting these problems. He continued that he himself hoped to continue to see L/3 and he was sure that things would work out. He stressed that he and his faction value the friendship and loyalty of individuals such as 1/3 whereas the LIRING establishment is interested only in groups and organizations that can further their own interests.

5. GUIDANCE/INFORMATION given to agent:

Rowton encouraged 1/3 to continue his efforts to find steady employment since he was most vulnerable to both the LIRING agents as well as FAR in the matter of his financial resources. L/3 told Rowton that he had already been promised an appointment to some teaching position by Javier Espinosa, private secretary to Yañez, the Secretary of Education. L/3 commented that Espinosa is at heart a "good progressive" and has been very sympathetic to him since his return to Mexico. L/3 also stated that he intends to look up Heracleo Zepeda in the hope that the latter can place him somewhere in CCHASUPO or arrange a job with his Chiapas newspaper ("Renovación").

Howton also urged 1/3 to continue to elicit information from "Rómulo" concerning his faction of the PAR and any knowledge he might have concerning the independent operations being planned by FERCHEN in Guatemala.

CONTACT REPORT

1. Agent: LIAING/3
2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1000, 27/3/69; Calico Real Restaurant
3. Next Reeting: Same place and time, 7/4/69.
4. Information/Reports Given by Agent:

LIRING/3 reported that unfortunately "Romulo" (Maric Augosto MENDEZ Aguilar) had not reappeared since his last meeting with him ( 17/2/63) and that he felt he could do nothing but wait for him to initiate the recourtact.

LIRING/3 continued that on his own initiative he had dropped by the LIRING offices on 21 March, feeling that he should not continue to remain in isolation despite the unfavorable ruzors against hic apparently originated by that office. He told Powton that unfortunately he did not find anyone of importance in the offices at that time, but was told by the gatekeeper that "they wanted to see hin" and that he should retura early the following week.

LIRING/3 contined to Routen that instead of returning to the office że decided to telephone LIRING/9 at his home. Ze did so on the morning of 25/3/69 but was tola by a woman with a Mexican accent (obviously the maid)that neither LIRING/9 nor LIRING/2 was at home. LIRING/3 then left his name and asked the woman to inform either of them that he had called.

LIRING/3 continued that about 1200 that same day (25/3/69) his old friend Identity B appeared unannounced at tis appartzent. 1/3 told Rowton that although it was obvious that Iden B had appeared in response to the telephone message that L/3 had left for LIRING/9, Iden B did not refer to it, explaining simply that he had dropped arcund to see how LIRING/3 and his wife were doing. Je did mentioned subsequently in the cooversation that be vas now living with LIRING/2 and LIRING/9 and LIRING/13 in their "very ample" apartment. Iden B continued that he hoped to reziin in Mexico until July 1969 and that he was pleuning to marry a Mexican divorcée with three children (boys) whom he had originally net many years ago in a visit to Mexico City.

LIRING/3 told Roston that Iden B was surprisingly cordial, regretting the fact that they had not seen each other for some time and encouraging LidING/3 to keep in touch in the future. He invited 1/3 to lunch on 29/3/69 but asked him to telephone to confirs. He save L/3 the telephone number of LIANG/98 residence, apparently forgetting that 1/3 already had the number.

Iden B then told LIKING/3 not to be disturbed over the rumors circulating about him, since he himself had been subjected to auch the same treatment


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

2. 
several years previously in FERCHEN. He then stated that in any case the FERCHEN Chief would not be returning to Mexico, and that this should make 1/3 happy. To console L/3, Iden B continued that the LIRING Chief was not popular with the staff, since he was considered to forcel and snobbish, and sozeviat petty in his vindictiveness. Iden B agreed with 1/3 that the LIRING Chier had done much to harm LIRING/3's reputation, and probably acted from purely personal motives (under the influence of Carmen Lozada's father and husband).

Iden B did not tell 1/3 who would replace the LIRING Chief. He commented that for some time back he had withdrawn from politefis and tried to wind his own business, earning his living by giving lectures on his own initiative.

On the domestic situation in FERCHEN, Iden B commented that things were "very bad" both politically and economically. He explained that FERCHEN currently found itself in a squeeze play between the big powers and was senuinely fearful of a Soviet/Nixon repprochement, at their expense, of course. On the economic side Iden B commented that he was happy to be in Mexico but added weekly that there was every hope that things would get better by 1970. Then L/3 countered that everyone had been singing that tune for many years, Iden B did not defend his position.

LIRING/3 then told Routon that he took the occasion to mention to Iden B that a certain Carlos Vega (akaCarlos Enrique LOPEZ Garcia) had been pestering hiş in the hope of finding someone traveling to PERUMEN who would be willing to carry some packages to some of his friends (including the son of Turcios). nep L/3 asked Iden B whether he would be willing to meet this Carlos Vega before consenting to carry over his packages, Iden B replied; "Sí, como no. Con sucho gusto."

LIRING/3 commented to Rexton that he brought up the name of Carlos VEGa as a sign of good faith both vis-avis the latter as well as the LIRING office since he felt it highly probably that Vega was reporting regularly to the LIRING couple either directly or indirectly and that in fact Vega had possibly been sent to check on LIRING/3 and his wife. LIRING/3 continued that he planned to recon-tact Jacobo Rodríguez Padilla and ask him to pass along the message to Carlos Vega that LIRING/3 was anxious to see him again since he felt that he had re-solved Vega's "problem."

LIRIEG/3 also teid Rowton that he had expressed the desire to Iden B to re-visit PERCHEN some time in the future. Iden B replied that he would do every-thing he could to expedite the visa, which he said he felt present no problem.

LIRING/3 also told Rowton that LIRING/4 had received a letter from her mother asking her to attempt to obtain a 30-day visitor's visa for her to come to Mexico on vacation. LIRING/3 told Rowton that he and FIRING/4 had already


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

3. 
made formal application for the visa, although they were not optimistic that Gobernación would grant it. LIRING/3 added that he did not mention this development to Iden B , although he might possibly mention it in passing at his next chat. LIRING/3 commented to Rostea that he felt LIRING/4's mother might have some interesting Fossip but could not be expected to tell him and LIRING/4 anything startling. He added that he had applied for the visa more out of courtesy that in earnest and actually hoped that the visa would not be granted, since this would give him and LIRING/4 a good pretext to make another trip to FERUMEN for purely personal reasons.

2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1000, 7/4/69; restaurant of Camino Real hotel.
3. Next Meeting: 1000, 9/4/59; same place.
4. Information/Reports Given by Agent:

LIRING/3 reported that at long last "Romulo"( Mario Augusto Mendez Aguilar) had reappeared at his apartment, or the afternoon of 2 April, without prior notice, as usual. LIRING/3 told Rowton that "Rómulo" apologized for not having been able to revisit LIRING/3 before that date, and explained that he had been "out of town". According to L/3 "Romulo" did not give any explanation of his absence since mid-February and L/3 felt he could not ask for such explanation. "Rómulo" promised to keep in touch with LIRING/3 by dropping in to his apartment "whenever he could". LIRING/3 told Rowton that he made a discreet effort to get from "Rómulo" a telephone number or address through which he could be contacted.

LIRING/3 also reported that he had met with Iden B twice during Easter week, but as yet had been unable to get into his residence, as he had hoped. He stressed that his relationship with Iden B was in-proving steadily and he felt this a good sign, inasmuch as he felt certain that Iden B would not take the initiativeof recontacting LIRING/3 without prior consultation with LIRING/9 and LIRING/2.

LIRING/3 then told Rowton that LIRING/4 had received a very pessimistic letter from a certain Echemendia, a uncle residing in Brooklyn, New York, who stated that LIRING/4's father was dying of cancer of the throat and was unable to leave his home. LIRING/3 continued that he had just dis-covered that LIRING/4 on her own initiative had rushed to the U.S. Consulate and requested a visa. As she subsequently told LIRING/3, LIRING/4 was informed by a consular official that her case would have to be "in-vestigated carefully by ICFACT" and that she was required to pay 125 pesos for a telegram to Washington, D.C. to expedite the case. LIRING/3 told Rowton that he felt LIRING/4's action had been precipitous and could cause him additional embarrassment with the LIRING office.. He added that he did not think a visa would be granted, but asked Rowton to do whatever he could to make certain that LIRING/4's request was turned down. He con-tinued that in view of this unexpected development, he felt it wise


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

2. 
to recontect LIRING/9 and tell him about LIRING/4's application for the
visa. Rowton agreed that this would be the best course of action, especi-
ally since LIRING/3 had originally mentioned LIRING/4's desire to visit
her sick father and the problem this represented for him, when he first
talked to LIRING/9 after his return from Guatemala.

LIRING/3 t-ld Rowton that he feit this would also constitute a good pre-
text to sound out LIRING/9 about his personal feelings toward LIRING/3
and his own situation in the LIRING Office. Rowton suggested that LIRING/3
take this occasion to mention casually that he was still in occasional
contact with the Guatemalans and to give LIRING/9 the names of "Rómulo"
and Carlos Vega, if L/9 asked for details.

2. Date & Site of Meeting: 1000, 11/4/69, Camino Real restaurant.
3. Kext Heeting: Same time, place, 1000, 14/4/33.
4. Information/ Reports Given by Agent:

LIRING/3 reported that he received an unexpected visit on 9/4/69 from Rogelio Aguirre, brother of Jerjes Aguirre, whon both he and LIRING/4 have known for many years (from their work together in PERUMER). LIRING/3 told Roston that he was surprised at the visit since both Rogelio and Jerjes aguirre were close trienas' or Teresa Lozada and her husband, Carlos Fersebal. 1/3 explained to Rowton that both Rogelio and Jerjes are employed in the Secretaría de Educación where Teresa Lozada worked for several years.

LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that Rogelio, without making any reference to the Persabal family, asked IRING/3 to do him an important favor. He went on to state that, as LIRENG/3 new,
Identity C was currently living in her home town in FBRUMEN( the same area that LIRING/4 comes from) and was hoping to visit them in Mexico City in the near future. Rogelio continued that he hoped that LIRING/3 could have a check from a Canadian bank and immigration documents hand-carried to Iden C so that she could pay for the ticket and present the Mexican visa locally in PBRUMEN. LIRING/3 told Reston that although he felt a bit mystified at this request, he told Rogelio Aguirre that he would do what he could to find someone who was planning a trip to PBRUMEN in the near future.

LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that the name of his friend Iden B immediately came to his mind, and he attempted to telephone him at the apartment of LIRING/9. He, however, found that the telephone was not in service, and felt that he had an excellent pretext to visit the apartment about 1500 on that same day (11/4/69) explaining to Iden B (and/or LIRING/2 or /9) that he had to get in touch urgently to pass on the request of Rogelio Aguirre. LIRING/3 agreed with Roston that he could take this occasion to ask the LIRING office to attempt to obtain information on the state of health of the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

2. 
father of LIRI:G/4 through the LIRING office in New York City. IMMIG/3 agreed that there was litle chance of this request being honored, but it would serve to reveal his lack of any other channeis to LIRING/4 's father and stress the legitimacy of LIRING/4's concern for the health of her father( an application for a visa to visit him).

LIRING/3 then stated to nowton that he suspected the telephone of the LIRING/9 apartment was tapped. He explained that generally when he had called in the past, there was an unexplained interruption in the line before the party could reply. He stressed to howton that this was his own manconal cheomention

LIRING/3 promised Rowton that when he visite: the apartment: that afternnon he would take as good a note as possible of the lay-out and furnishings and ascertain the identity of the maid.

# CONTACT REPORT

21 April, 1969

A. Agent: LIRING/3

B. Date & Site of Meeting: 1000, 21/4/69; Cemino Real Restaurant.

C. Next Meeting: Sene time, place; 25/4/59

D. Reports/Information Given by Agent:

LIRING/3 apologized for not having been able to make the last scheduled meeting with Rowton, 1000 on 18/4/69. He explained that his friend, Iden B, had unexpectedly dropped in to see him at that time and he felt it more important to see him again than to make the meeting with Rowton ( he subsequently left a message with Rowton's answering service).

LIRING/3 continued that he explained to Iden B the emotional strain that LIRING/4 was undergoing as a result of the bad news concerning her father's health. He then asked Iden B to attempt to ascertain the true state of his health through the LIREG Office in New York and gave Iden B the name and telephone number of the aunt of LIRING/4 who appeared to be the best source. Iden B, according to LIRING/3 promised to send a message with the next pouch and hoped to have news for LIRING/3 within the next ten days.

According to LIRING/3, Iden B then suggested that LIRI.G/3 think about moving to PERCYEN for a "lengthy stay, perhaps indefinitely." He explained that he felt he understood LIRING/3's problems, the slumnies, the subtle persecution and the resultant increasingly difficult financial situation he found himself in, and he felt there was no real solution in Mexico. In EEROMEN, however, he could manage much more easily for his wife and child, since most of his basic financial problems would be solved. He added that he was sure that he could find LIRING/3 some sort of work in the cultural field as soon as he returned to FERCHEN and then arrange an invitation. LIRING/3 told Rowton that although he regarded this proposition as encouraging (since he was certain that Iden B had prior approval from the LIRING Office), he took a natural and logical approach in replying to Iden B. He stated that he told Iden B that in principle he agreed but he had to face the realities of the situation. First he was not at all certain that he could convince his wife to make such a move, and second, he was not optimistic that Iden B could arrange a good position for him in PERUKS that could permit him to work seriously and, of course, make enough money to meet his living expenses. Iden B


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 39

replied that he felt it quite possible to arrange something for LIRING/3 and for that reason hai brougat up the idea at this point.

Rowton told LIRING/3, in reply to his query, that such a trip to PBRUKES would be interesting to him only if LIRILG/3 was offered a position in the cultural field with good access to FM intellectuals and government officials. LIRING/3 agreed, commenting that hezew Iden D and such young rebelswell enough to develop good contact with them, provided he was given a reasonably sericus job. In any case he promised to work co LIRING/4 in the hope of persuading her to go along with him, when and if Iden B's proposal materialized.

LIRING/3 continued that Iden B then cffered to arrange en exposition
for LIRING/3 at Iden F in Cuernavaca, stating that he could
was a close friend of his. LIRING/3 accepted this apparently genuine offer and arranged to travel to Cuernavaca on the morning of 22/4/69 to talk the matter over with the director of the art galleries.

LIRING/3 then reported to Rowton that "Rómulo" had ageir visited him at his apartment late on the evening of 13/4/69 (thus anticipating the meeting for 1830 in front of woolworth's for the following day,as originally planned). According to LIRING/3, "Rómulo" (Mario Augosto Mendez Aguilar) told his that he had taken the liberty of coming that evening to LIRING/3's apartment since he wanted to talk in private of "something that LIRING/3 could do to help his friends". "Romulo" then went co to explain that one of his comrades was expected to arrive in Mexico City "in the rear future" and would need a secure place to live, at leaste until he could find a place of his own. "Rezulo stressed that this person, whose identity be himelf did not asset know, would be traveling "clandestinely and eculd not risk renting a room on his own until he had established himself in the area. LIRITG/3 replied that he, of course, would do his best, but pointed out that he himself was not in a good position to protect anyone. We finally agreed that this person might be able to use his kitchen as temporary living quarters, entering and leaving the apartment throught the back(service)entrance. LIRING/3 pointed out to "Rócalo" that the back door to the apartment house was locked at 1700 every day and that therefore it would be necessary for the person using that entrance to return to the apartment for good every night before 1700. "Rómulo" was ap-parently satisfied with this offer of LIRING/3 and poised to let him know when the person arrived in Mexico City.

"Rómulo" then mentioned to LIRING/3 that Iden E vas currently in the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 40

3. 
PBRUKEN capital and that he himself ("Rómulo") was in more or less regular touch with the mother of "El Chino", (whom LIRING/3 understood tobe Yon Sosa). "Rómulo" also mentioned in passing that he works for two or three hours a day in the accounts office of *Ovaciones* and also does some part time work at a golf club in Mexico City.

E. Information/Guidance Given to Agent:

Rowton asked LIRING/3 to continue to press Iden B for more specific information about his proposed assistance to LIRING/3 in obtaining a job in FBRUMENT AND some indication was to the extent of the knowledge and backing of the LIRING office. Rowton did not encourage LIRING/3 to take such a proposal seriously until he could get more concrete data from Iden B.

With regard to "Rómulo's" request for assistance, Rowton stated that he would be much more interested in this development, when and if LIRING/3 could get the identity of the comrade of "Rómulo" whom he was to provide a safehouse for. Rowton suggested that LIRING/3 put this person up when he appeared for a few days, long enough to permit Rowton to get a look at him and identify him. A determination could then be made as to the best course of action for LIRING/3 with regard to this person. In reply to LIRING/3's query, Rowton thought that it would be best to reinsure with the LIRING office regarding this matter by casually mentioning to Iden B that he was performing this service for his FAR friends. LIRING/3 agreed, commenting that he hoped that he would not again be caught in the crossfire between the LIRING Office and the nationalist faction of the FAR.

4.  Reports/Information Given by Agent:

LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that he went to Cuernavaca early on the morning of 22/4/69 alone, since Iden B backdout of the trip at the last minute, saying he had to remain in Mexico City. LIZING/3, however, was able to talk to the Director of the Art Gallery of Iden F himself and arranged an ex-position for 7 June, 1959.

LIKING/3 continued to Rowton that when he returned home late that same right he found a acte from his wife informing biz that she had gone out to telephone long distance and would not be back until late that night. when she returned she informed him that she had received a telegram informing her that her father had died at 2030 cm the previous evening (21/4/69) and that she had been attempting to telephone her mother in FBAUMEN but had not been able to get through.

LIRING/3 continued that his father-in-law was buried on 24/4/69 End that his wife was still in a state of depression and grief, especially since she had been unable to see her father before his death or attend the funeral.

LIRING/3 also reported that at about 1030 cm 23/4/59 a Guatemalan,zged abcut 25.poorly dressed and somewhat resembling Carlos Vega, bad appeared urannounced at his apartment with a small piece of paper on which were written LIZING/3's name and address. He introduced hizself without care simply as a "friend of the Leda Farrios brothers fro Guaterala City," and asked LIRING/3 to put his up for a few days.

LIRING/3 told Rowton that he agreed after soze reluctance, suspecting that this was the person referred to by Mario Mendez (Rómulo"), although the young Guatemalan did not mention "Rómulo" by name. LIRING/2 told Rowton that before promising to rut the Guatemalan up, he commented to him that although he had a great deal of personal respect for the León Barrios brothers he was disappointed that neither they nor their mother had written to him for the past several months, apparently

because they believed the calumnies spread against hin by Carlos Ferzabai,
According to LIRING/3, the young Guatemalan told hia that his friends back in Guatemala City continued to have confidence in LIPIC/3, but "had to respect the opinions of others.and has no alternative but to discontinue correspondence with LIRING/3,at least for a respectable period." He continued that LIRING/3 should realize that their organization in Guatezaie City was is no position to check out verious and sundry charges maie against their friends and had to let tize take care of most of their problems of this cature.

LIRIFG/3 told Rowton that he finally gave the unexpected house-guest a cct to in cue room of als cala, moving the letter to his studio. Ee then asked the guest to remain as inconspicucus as possible, informing hin that he expected a number of children that afternzon for an art lesson in the apartcent. The Guatemakan prczised to be out of the apartment during the day and to return late night. IMIG/3 told Boston that in fact he did not reappear until about 2300 that night, and left before 0700 the following morning. When he returned at about 2200 on the night of 24/4/59 he informed LING/3 that he would be leaving the apertsent the next corming early and would not have to return. Be thanked LIRING/3 profusely the next morning (25/4/69) and left at about 0900 without telling LIRING13 where he intežed to go.

LIRING/3 continued to Rewton that at about 1930 on 23/4/69, when he returned to his apartment, he found "Romulo" (Mario Mendez Auilar) in his living room having coffee with his wife. LIRING/3 took the occasion to teli Rómulo about the unexrected houseguest. According to LIRING/3 "Rózulo" appeared genuinely surprised and asked for the identity and physical description of the person. When LIRING/3 told him as much as he knew, "Romulo" stated that: he could not identify the person as a friend of his. Ee speculted that the urannounced guest had been sent to check on. LIRING/3 and advised him to be cautious and as normal as possible in his routine while the person re- zain in the house. He said that he did not exclude the possibility that this person had been sent by the LIRING office "to check on LIRING/3's private life". "Rómulo" then offerred LIRING/3 a revolver for his self- defense, but LIBING/3 turned it down, saying that he was not worried to that extent. According to LIG/3, "Romulo" stated that he himself pre- ferred to avoid meeting the young Guatemalan since he could not identify hin. He reassured LIRING/3 that his own comrade who might also be in need

of a saferoom would not appear unannounced in such a manner, addite
chat to date he did not have any definite word on this person's ΞΑ
in Mexico City.

LIRING/3 told Boston that he expects "Rómulc" to revisit him at his
home sometice during the late evening of 26/4/69. He told Howton that
it occurred to him that he zight invited Iden B to the apartment
on the same night in the hope that he could witness a face-to-face zeeting
with "Rómulo" and Iden B. Ee felt that this would serve to keep his hands
as clean as possible in the eves of the LIRING office, since he was certain
that Iden B would report promptly of his meeting with "Balo."
Roxton agreed, feeling that it was important for 11810/3 to bring
occasiocal meetings with "Aczulo" fully to the attention of the i
office, on the off chance that they already did not know about thes, and
that Iden B would be the best channel for this.

4. Reports/Information Given by Agent:

LIRIKG/3 announced with apparent pleasure that at long last the commo channel with the PAR had been reopened. He stated that he had just received a letter from the elder of the tuc león Barrios brothers ( Miguel and Juén) indicating that in his mind the long period of "probation" was over that and that closer contact could be expected in the near future. aen 83orea conta a letter dated 28 April, 1969, in the handwriting he stated he recog-
nized as that of Miguel/Barrios, in which the writer, who signed the letter as "Julio Antonio", informed LIRING/3 that he had just been released from prison ("sanatorio") and was planning to leave town until things cool off for him. LIRING/3 told Roston that he understood the double-talk of the writer to mean that he needed money (Q.100) to travel to Mexico where he hoped to visit IIRING/3. Rowton's photostat and translation of the letter is attached here- with.

The envelope, postmarked Guatemala City, 2/5/69, is addressed to LIRING/4 (as previously requested by LIPING/3) and bears the re- turn address J. Antonio Medina, 24 Calle 1-65, Zona 1, Guatemala, and was sent special delivery. LIRING/3 told Roston that he did not recognize the return address, and assumed that it, as well as the sender's name, Medina, was notional. He added that "Violeta" was the code word for oper tional contact with anyone arriving on behalf of the León Barrios brcthers, and that Doña Luisa referred to Marta, the mother of the León Barrios brothers.

when Roxton agreed that LIRING/3 should send some money, no more that 1,000 pesos ( Q 80 ) with a cover letter from G/4 (os- tensibly) but in his own handwriting, explai:ming in double-talk that fortunately he is doing fairly well financially and that LIRING/4 is now working in an art gallery and expects to inherit money from her father who recently passed away. LIMING/3 promised to have the cover letter and enveloce ready when he met with Roxton on 7/5/69 so that he could insert the money order. 1/3 told Rowton

that he felt it best to send the corey orier in the name of Elsa,
the eldest of the León Barrios sisters, rather than to the mother
(Karte) as reçuested in the letter. He exp'sined that the last money
order (actually certified bank check) in Elsa's nane, sent by LIRIC/4,
arrived safely and apperently was cashed without difficulty. Rowton
suggested that III.G/3 send the letter, rezistered with receipt requested,
just to be sure that the letter arrived at its destination.

Guatemala, 28 April, 1959

Dear LIRING-4:

I am very happy to be able to write to you. Excuse me for not having been able to do so until now, but it was only last week that I was able to leave the sanatorium. My departure from such a place was quite a relief. My health was declining and I almost had a relapse. Everyone at home celebrated. My brother sends you his best.

My letter has two purposes: first to excuse myself for not being able to get to your home; it's because, since I am still not recovered, the doctor has told me to recuperate in the country, and, to avoid problems these days, I'm planning to go to uncle Tio's farm. In any case they'll be coming to you on behalf of Violetta since they are still talking about the business here and are/interested. That should take place any day now.

My other purpose in writing to you is to bother you for a favor. I should tell you that I have married Liz and she is now expecting a baby. (Finally I was able to follow your advice). Now that I am leaving for the farm, she will be left alone and with some financial difficulties. Since you had invited both of us there, and this is not possible, I hope you will be able to send her something. I think she could use about Q. 100 to very good use. If you could send it to Doña Luisa - she and I would be very much obliged.

Everything else is going very well. I am

as ever your friend,

## ACTA OPERATIVA No. RHM-20650
(Translation of report from FBI RCA on Humberto GONZALEZ Vega)

1. The business card of Humberto GONZALEZ Vega is printed with the logo of: "Salv. Editores Mexicanos, S.A., Telefono 46-77-77, Madrid 22, Mexico 4, D.F...". CONALEP's name and "Division Medicina" have been added to the card.

2. GONZALEZ recently (date not known) obtained a Guatemalan passport at the Guatemalan Consulate in Mexico City. In applying for the passport, GONZALEZ indicated it would be used to travel to Venezuela on behalf of his company (Galvex). There are now doubts about the story of travel to Guatemala. GONZALEZ is a long-time member of the Guatemalan Communist Party (PCT). When he joined the PCT in 1962 he was a member of the Ferrocarriles de Guatemala. In 1954 he went to Buenos Aires as an exile, and also with other Communists was imprisoned in the jail of Villa Devoto on orders of General Ponc. (It is only just to add that there was no valid reason for jailing then). Years later GONZALEZ returned to Guatemala where he has a wife and several children that he claims to support. He is separated from his wife (who is still in Guatemala) and lives with another woman in Mexico.

3. In any event, GONZALEZ is still a member of the PCT, and has spent many months in jail because of his Communist activities. On one occasion he was jailed during the regime of Miguel IDIGORAS Fuentes, and again when Colonel Enrique PERALTA Azurdia was in power. GONZALEZ has lived in Mexico as a political asylee, but has returned clandestinely to Guatemala on several occasions, only to be expelled from that country again. In Mexico he has almost always been the "responsable" (one in charge) of the Guatemalan Communists living in Mexico... that is the representative of the PCT in Mexico. At least the visible representative. Even while Victor Manuel GUTIERREZ Garbin was alive, and GUTIERREZ died in 1966, GONZALEZ had a responsible position. Among his functions was keeping an eye on GUTIERREZ.

4. It is possible that GONZALEZ' perseverance in seeking a Guatemalan passport, and it took him nearly two years to get it, is because of a desire to go to Cuba or one of the Iron Curtain countries. Or again, it may be that he wants to go to Venezuela as he claims. He gives the impression that he receives a salary from the PGT, and his employment (with-Galvex) -- if he is employed there -- is nothing more than a cover for his political activities.

5.  GONZALEZ’ nickname is “El Gato” ( the cat) -- a nickname applied to him because of his light colored eyes. He is about 5’7” in height, has light colored skin, a strong build, and has a stoop. He has a large head and a closely trimmed moustache. His most distinctive features are his large cheeks. He is what you might call ruffy-cheeked. When he walks he struts. Undoubtedly the Security service in Guatemala have numerous photographs of Gonzalez, as well as a more complete physical description. The description I have given is largely from memory.

6.  As the writer and GONZALEZ have known each other for many years (and the writer also gave him some help in getting his passport), GONZALEZ, at a recent (no date) chance meeting, invited the writer for coffee. Naturally he wanted to obtain information of importance. Naturally he wanted to obtain information of importance. We say the following:

"Guerrilla warfare is not the revolutionary line to be followed in Guatemala. The guerrillas were mocked out, and the only result (of guerrilla warfare) was that it demoralized the masses and has set back the revolutionary movement several years. The Central Committee of the PGT committed a grave error when it allowed the “Jovenes” (here refers to the young violent revolutionaries) to assume a role of importance. Many of these “jovenes” were trained in Cuba. (What happened was) that the PGT Central Committee was on the verge of being completely replaced by the youth leaders. To avoid this, the Central Committee found it necessary to include some of the youth leaders in the Central Committee. This naturally led to a change to the “guerrilla line”. Most of the capable political leaders of the Party have died uselessly for this cause."

Later in the conversation GONZALEZ became quite agitated and said:

"And to think that I met with some guerrilla leaders and some other youths men who just came to Mexico from Guatemala who want aid, money, and recruits in order to reorganize the guerrilla bands in the interior of Guatemala and continue the fight. This would serve no purpose and I refused to give them my aid. The only thing I told them was that this was the wrong approach.”

1.  Headqarter's files contain the following information on a Humberto GONZALEZ and Emberto GONZALZZ Vega who is probably identical with the CONZALEZ described by LIRISG/3 in reference.

a. In September 1954 one Humberto GONZALEZ, in company with other exiles, was deported from Guatemala to Panama. On 9 September this exile group arrived in Panama on board an Argentine military aircraft. It was further reported that on 10 September, this same group departed for Argentina via Guayaquil, Lisa, and Santiago. GONZALEZ, described as a Quatemalan national, utilized safe conduct pass #1252 or $12925, which listed his occupation as being a railroad vorker (sour:: MZM-1100; 17 September 1954)

b. In early May 1957 ane Humberto GONZALEZ Tegs was reported as being a member of the Aliarra de la Juventud Democratica de Guatemala. (AJDG), a Communist youth group. This group vas active in the preparation and distribution of propaganda which was being directed against the Guatezalan Government. GONZALEZ was further identified as an individual who had previously taken asylum in the Argentine Eabassy, bad a known Commmmist background, and vas presently exployed as a salesman for the HICUL Company in Guatemala City. (Source: EGG-965, 24 May 1957, ESCONSON/2 from ESCONSON/10)

1. Forwarded herewith as attachment #1 are eight reports prepared by Wallace B. ROWTON on the latest developments of the LIRING-3 operation. The most important of these are reviewed below.

*   "Romulo," who later described himself as Mario MENDEZ, appeared on the scene as the liaison man between LIRING-3 and the Guatemalan FAR...
*   Humberto GONZALEZ Vega, whom MENDEZ called "El Gato," apparently made initial contact with LIRING-3 on his own initiative. MENDEZ said that "El Gato" was a "good element" but emphasized that he (MENDEZ) would be the person LIRING-3 would deal with on FAR matters. A copy of the sketch of MENDEZ drawn by LIRING-3 was shown by the Station to LIREBEL-2. The latter, without any hesitation, identified it as Javier CONTRERAS, leading FAR representative.

in Mexico and a suspected PBRUMEN contact. The Station had the LIEMBRACE team cover the entrance of the building where MENDEZ and other FAR members have an apartment they use for clandestine meetings with LIRING-3. Despite the fact that the team knows LIRING-3 from previous surveillance and that a copy of LIRING-3's sketch of WENDEZ was also provided, the LIEMBRACES spotted neither man. The Station naturally plans to cover another meeting and is also exploring the possibility of determining who rented the apartment and from whom. It is of some interest to note that MENDEZ, although he gave LIRING-3 the agreed upon recognition signal, may still not be the "Pavel" LIRING-3 was told he would meet. LIRING-3 was shown a photograph of Oscar Arturo PEREZ Ramirez (know, to have serviced a letter drop in Mexico City used by Michelle Jeannette FIRK before her death in Guatemala). LIRING-3 thougnt it looked like a poor print of a photograph of "Pavel" shown to hin while still incarcerated.

b. LIRING-3 is apparently still suspicious in the eyes of the FAR in Guatemala. several letters (see paragraph 2) from members of the FAR in Guatemala warning him that adverse rumors (some of then calling him a WOFIRM agent) have been circulated in that country by Carlos PERZABAL Marcue. Knowing that PERZABAL's father-in-law is a close friend of Chief, LIRING, LIRING-3 sourced the rumors to the LIRING headman. He first took up the matter of the accusations made against hin with LIRING-9. The latter said there was nothing to this, but, and there was a but, LIRING-9 reminded LIRING-3 that in the past he had been connected "with a person of mysterious and suspicious affiliations," a clear reference to ROWTON, LIRING-3's Greek friend. When LIRING-3 insisted he wanted to discuss the matter of the allegations zade against his directly with Chief, LIRING, LIRING-9 promised to make an appointment for him. This appointment, however, never materialized. That Chief, LIRING nay have spread the allegations made against LIRING-3 by PERZABAL was confirzed by Rolando SUAREZ (see ROWTON'S report dated 31 December). LIRING-3 also took up the matter of the PERZABAL denunciations with MENDEZ, who told him that the FAP had paid no attention to them and even accompanied LIRING-3 to PERZABAL'S house. LIRING-3, however, nade the mistake of giving his name when asked who was calling. The result, as could be expected, was that PERZABAL was "not in." MENDEZ agreed to accompany LIRING-3 to LIFING to talk to its Chief, but he warned LIRING-3 not to make accusations without proof. MENTIDEZ, incidentally, does not appear to be pro-PBRUMEN. This is interesting in view of the fact that CONTRERAS, with whom he may be identical, is a suspected contact of the PBRUMENers.

c. So far, it does not seen that the FAR has been greatly disturbed by the accusations made against LIRING-3. In fact, MENDEZ and the two other FAR members LIRING-3 met on 1 January have urged LIRING-3 to join them in the hills of Guatemala, where guerrilla warfare, they said, will soon be

intensified. They did not hide that their purpose was to broadcast LIRING-3's name and the fact that a Mexican had joined their fight. This was apparently to appeal to the Mexican left and gain their support. While LIRING-3 has declared himself ready to go back to Guatemala (if this was what ROWTON wanted him to do), he did not need ROWTON to decide that broadcasting his name from the jungles of Guatemala was not a thing he wanted anyone to do. At Station directive, LIRING-3 pointed out that after his recent imprisonment he had to take care of his wife before doing any more for the cause. The best way to do this was to take LIRING-4 to PERUMEN and leave her with relatives. This led LIRING-3 to ask what, if anything, he could do for the FAR in Mexico. So far, however, his FAR friends have not risen to the bait.

2. Forwarded under separate cover as attachment #2 are the following documents:

Subject: 23 December, 1968
LIRING/3 Report of Contact by "Pavel" of FAR.

1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 1000 on 23/12/68 at the restaurant in the Camino Real Hotel that at long last the FAR contact promised by the León Barrios brothers had appeared. LIRING/3 told Rowton that at about 1900 on 19 December a Guatemalan came to his apartment and introduced himself as "a friend of Violeta." L/3 invited him in but asked him not to discuss anything sensitive in the presence of his wife. After about ten minutes of chit chat in the apartcent, L/3 and the Guatemalan, who gave his name simply as "Romulo", went to a nearby restaurant to talk privately.

2. According to LIRING/3, the Guatemalan stated that he had been ordered by FAR to maintain contact with 1/3. When queried by 1/3 regarding the Humberto González Vega whom he had met previously, "Rómulo" exclaimed, "Oh, you mean 'El Gato' - he's a good element, but he will not bein your FAR contact. I have been entrusted with that mission." "Rómulo" also stazed that he knew Francisco Lara well and had worked with him in Guatemala City some time ago until Lara was arrested. "Rómulo" added that unfortunately Lara's mother had betrayed him to the police and he barely escaped arrest at that time. "Rómulo" confirmed that Lara had been under a cloud as far as his superiors were concerned and had made the ill-fated trip in order to attempt to clear himself of charges against him.

3. When LIRING/3 told "Rómulo" that he had been in touch with the LIRING office since his return, the latter exclaimed, "But what have the LIRING people to do with us?" This gave L/3 the definite impression that "Rómulo" himself was not in touch with a PERUMEN representative in Mexico City, and, in any case, did not like the LIRING establishment.

4. He then asked L/3 to give him a summary report of the arrest and detention. L/3 told Rowton that he balked at this at first, protesting to "Rómulo" that he had already given the details to the León Barrios brothers and Cebollito" who he was sure had passed on the report to the FAR in Guatemala. Then "Rómulo" explained that he would appreciate an oral report on the spot since he was not fully informed because of communications problems, LIRING/3 told Rowton that he went over the whole episode for "Rómulo's" benefit. "Romulo" then asked to see LIRING/3 again at 1100 on 21 December to continue their discussion. He promised to meet L/3 on the street in front of his apartment house at the appointed time.

5. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that much to his surprise and indignation he received a letter on the following day(20/12/68) from Martha, the mother


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 65

2. 
of the León Barrios brothers, in which, among other things, she stated that
"the man on the bicycle", which L/3 explained to Kowton meant Carlos
Persabal had written a letter containing grave charges
against LIRING/3. The letter, which 1/3 read aloud to Roxton, went on to
assure L/3 that these charges were not believed but constituted a source
of annoyance to the writer's friends.

6. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that he felt so indignant and shocked at
   this unpleasant development that he decided to see the Chief LIKING and
   have it out with him. L/3 explained that since the Chief LIRING is on very
   friendly terms with the father-in-law of Persabal he might be aware of the
   letter and even possibly enccurgaged Persabal to write it. L/3 told Rowton
   that he then got in touch with LIRING/2 by telephone and made a date to meet
   nim at the LIKING establishment at 0930 on 21/12/62. when he arrived at the
   gate at that time he was told that LIRING/2 had not yet arriveed. After a wait
   of some twenty minutes, LIRING/2 appeared but asked LIRING/3 to wait a little
   longer since he was very busy. After another annoying wait, LIRING/9 appeared
   instead of LIRING/2 and talked with LIRING/3 on the patio. LIRING/3 explained
   that he wanted urgently to talk with the Chief LIRING since something had
   come up with regard to Persebal. He reminded LIRING/9 that he originally had
   exppressed a desire to have a face-to-face confrontation with Persabal in
   the LIRING office so that he could present his report on the arrest in his
   presence. LIRING/9, according to LIKING/3, brushed this off again with the
   comment, "But as I told you before, you're making a mountain of a molehill.
   You're exaggerating the whole business."

7. LIRING/3 told Rowton that he then took out Martha's letter and insisted
   that LIRING/9 read it. The latter expressed amazement at the revelation of
   Persabal's action but did not agree with LIRING/3 that the Chief LIRING
   would be able to shed light on it. LIRING/3 then told LIRING/9 that he did
   not like the games that everycne seemed to be playing with him, and asked
   LIRING/9 point blank what it was thet zotivated him to ask for a written
   report of the arrest and, after L/3 complied with the request, to graf his
   feet. L/3 continued that he felt he had been frank with the LIRING office,
   whereas on the other hand they were not honest with him in telling him what
   they thought of him. 1/9 then assured 1/3 of his confidence inhim and added
   that in the past certain persons, including Hugo, the assistant to LIRING/11,
   had felt thatLIRING/3 had been connected with a person of mysterious and
   suspicious affiliations. L/3, understanding this to be a clear allusion to
   Rowton, admitted to having known this person in the past and having had

3. 
a few business transactions with him, including the sale of a number of his paintings, but insisted with some annoyance that this had got bearing on his political activity. LIRING/9 agreed and added that it was really a thing of the past that should not bother LIRING/3. He promised to make an appointment for LIRING/3 to see the Chief LIRING sometime the following week.

8. LIRING/3 continued that when he met with "Romulo" later that morning he also showed the letter from Marthe to him. According to L/3, "Rómulo" became indignant and suggested that they talk to Fersabal together to get to the bottom of the matter. L/3 and "Romulo" then took a taxi to the residence of Persabal in the hope of finding him in at the time. When L/3, however, rang the outside beèl he was told by a woman (who he suspects xxx was either Persabal's wife or sister-in-law) that Hersabal was not at home. 1/3 noted the woman's astonishment in ner che of voice when ac statennis name as uer request. "Romulo" who was present later commented that L/3 should not have given his name since it was obvious that Fersabal was at home but did not want to see LIPING/3.

9. According to 1/3, "Rómulo" at the second meeting stated that "several" friends of his were planning to return to Guatemala to continue their work for the PAR and that he hoped that LIRING/3 might be able to help in this mission. "Rómulo" did not specify what kini of assistance he expected from LIRING/3 cut promised to give him details then the time came for action in this matter. He promised to see 1/3 again at 1600 on 24 December, 1968.

10. LIKING/3 told Rowton that he planned to insist on seeing the Chief LIRING IN THE HOPE of determining his reaction to the charges by Persabal in view of the Chief's friendship with the in-laws of Fersabal.

26 December, 1968

1.  Agent: LIRING/3
2.  Date and Site of Meeting: 1100, 26/12/68; Camino Real Restaurant.
3.  Next Meeting: 1100, 28/12/68;
4.  Reports/Information Passed by Agent:

a) Contact of Carlos López: 1/3 reported that about 1430 ca 24 December as he and his wife arrived at their apartment, they found a *chaparito* who introduced himself as Carlos López, a Guatemalan friend of Jacobo Rodríguez (Padilla), and gave L/3 a note of introduction from that person. L/3 gave Rowton the original *lotton*, which is attached herewith. L/3 told Rowton that López stated that he was anxious to send various items, including medicines, to FBRUMEN, and appealed to L/3 since he "understood" that L/3 and his wife had contacts through which he could send the items. López, according to 1/3 appeared very interested to be reassured that L/3 really did have good contacts with the LIRING establishment. Then L/3 assured him that he did see LIRING respresentatives, López went on to reveal that he was a friend of Carlos Perzabal and that he was fully informed concerning the recent "tragic situation" of both Persabal and LIRING/3. This bomb shell shock L/3 badly and he felt obliged to launch into a diatribe against Perzabal. When López commented that "naturally we have to take Ferzabal's word against yours, since he know him better," L/3 told Rowton that he demanded an explanation of who the "we" were. López simply replied that it meant "important" persons in Guatemala and Mexico. He added that, as you know", Persabal was known even to César Montes. L/3 retorted, "But Montes has been stripped of his authority, as you should know." This led L/3 to the counterclaim that he also had good friends in Guatemala and Mexico who could testify on his behalt.

LIRING/3 told Rowton that he then showed López a photostatic copy of the attached letter which he had written to Perzabal demanding an explanation of the calumnies he was known to be spreading against him, and which he had already sent to the CP Mexico and Spain. He asked López to keep the copy and tell his good friend ferxabal where he got it and under what circumstances.

LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that he had to cut short the rather heated exchange with Lopez since he had a date at 1600 that same day with "Romulo" outside his apartment house.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

2. 
b) Contact with "Romulo": LIRING/3 told Roxton that he again sas Rómulo, the FAR liaison, outside his apartment house at about 1610 on 24 December, as prearranged. In view of what had transpired a IRM short time earlier that afternoon, he told Rómulo about the comments made by Carlos López. Rómulo, according to L/3, did not indicate that he knew Lopez at all, but agreed with 1/3 that the accusations of Perzabal must be met head-on. He suggested the following course of action: L/3 should wait for the reply from Marta (mother of León Barrios brothers) as to the exact charges made by Perzabal before taking up the catter with the Chief LIRING. tenced to agree with L/3 that the LIRING establishment might have inspired Perzabal's letter, but felt it would be better if 1L/3 had a statement from Marta before accusing the PBRUMEiers of bad that the time he would arrange a confrontation with Perzabal in the presence of three "important FAR officials in Mexico", including a certain Juliol also known as "Buda". Rómulo felt that Bude could lure Ferzabal to a private meeting sinne the latter texr already had interviewed him some time ago and would be anxious to see him again. This would provide a good pretext for a confrontation between Perzabal and LIRING/3 to clear up the whole matter.

C) Proposed Meeting with LIKING Chief: LIRING/3 told Roxton that he felt it essential to see the LIKING Chief ca the morning of 27 Dec even if he does not receive a reply from Marta by that time. e explained that he felt he could get some sort of statement from the LIRING Chief, either affirming or denying his knowledge of the Perzabal letter so that he could use this in a possible meeting with the latter in the presence of Rómulo and his colleagues. He said that he felt this important in view of a possible invitation to PBRUMEN that he might receive momentarily.

5. Information/Guidance Given to Agent: Roxton cautioned L/3 against jumping the gun in accusing the LIRISGs of inspiring the Ferzabal letter, po inting out that it could just as easily and logically have some from such Guatemalan exiles as Navarette, Capuano, or even persens of the César Montes group, who are expected to be close to the LIRINGS and the CPM as well as possibly the PTG

Subject: LIRING/3 Identification of "Rómulo" Reported FAR Lisaison.

1. At 1100 ca 28 December, 1968, LIRING/3 reported to Poston at the Camino Real restaurant that be had again met briefly with "Rómulo" in front of his (L/3's) apartment house about 1600 on 27/12/68. On this occasion "Rómulo" identified himself as Mario Mendez and promised to give LIELING/3 a telephone at which he could be contacted in the future.

2. With regard to the Perzabal accusations, "Rómulo" again cautioned LIRING/3 against jumping the gur with the Chief of LIRING ( i.e. accusing him of having inspired the charges), since if the LING Chief called his bluff, 2/3 would have no proof. "Rómulo" reccomended that L/3 wait until he received a reply from Marta giving details of the accusations before proceeding lurther. De autu vai al tutto and his collessnes would gladiy confront Persabal and clear up the matter.

3. LIRING/3 described "Romulo" as a Guatemalan of about 28 years of age, 5'6", 125 15s, sraight black thinning hair, small eyes, clipped moustache. 1/3 added that "Romulo" frequently squints his eyes, either from a zervous habit, or scie physical defect. LIRING/3 drew Rowton a rough sketch of "Rómulo" as he recalled him from the three brief meetings he as had with him to date.

4. LIKING/3 also gave Rowton the original of the letter from Marta taxri postmarked 18 December, 1968, in which mention was rade of the Perzabal charges. 1/3 reminded Rowton that Perzabal is referred to in the letter as "el hombre de la bicicletas and that the León Barrios brothers (sous of Marta) as "los patojos."

5. LIRING/3 also gave Rowton the original letter of KEXXEX Oscar Moisés Roldán Espinoza dated 27 November, 1968, which LIRICG/3 had received on 1 Decemner, 1968. The envelope bears the same return address as that of 7 November, 1968. Roldán encloses the negative of a snapshot of himself as a "recuerdo." The letter contains general greetings and a plea for whatever help 1/3 can manage to give soldán.

6. LIRING/3 asked Howton's approval to send 500 pesos to Marta (via ber sister) to encourage her to continue writing him and keeping him inforzad of what develops, especially if and when her sons are released. Rowton agreed but stressed that L/3 should explain that he had managed to have this extra money as a result of his recent exposition and to regret that he could not send more.

Subject: LIRING/3 Feport of Neeting with FLR Members in Mexico City.

1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at the Robin Restaurant at 1700 on 30/12/68 that when he returned to his apartment at about 1200 on 28/12/68 he found Mario Kendez (aka "Rómulo") waiting in the company of another FAR member, whom L/3 described as "very fat" aged about 25 with a dropping moustache. L/3 told Roxton that since he did not wish to involve his dice in conversation with these persons, invited them outside to a nearby res-taurant.

2. According to LIKING/3 Hario Kendez and his friend told him that FAR had decided finally to withdraw all its forces from the cities and to regrown in the mountains. in view of the increasing "repression" and the virtual impossibility of effective action in the urban areas of Gustezala. They stated that they and a number of their comrades in Mexico were pianning to return to Guatemala and join the FAR forces in the mountains. They then invited LIKING/3 to accompany them on their return trip, feeling that in that way he could contribute more to the struggle. In reply to I/3's queries they did not specify how L/3 was to survive another trip and in fact be of any use to them in the mountains. They sirply said that they felt it would be useful to give vide publicity to 1/3's presence in the mountains, once he reached that area. L/3 told Roston that he reacted to this scevhat startling proposal in as logical a way as possible, saying that he would have it give it careful thought, inasmuch as it raised a number of very serious problems with him and his family. Mario Kendez and his friend con-cluded with a rousing cheer for the "real revolutionaries" who put asite all thoughts of personal safety and comfort and rush into the battle. shen L/3 pointed out that they themselves after all had withdrawn from the action they replied that precisely for that reason they intended to return and do their share for the cause.

3. LIRDIG/3 also reported that he and his wife spent the 29th of December with Orlando Suarez in Cuernavaca and had lunch with him and Jorge Godoy. Suarez remarked privately to 1/3 that he had visited the LIRING offices on 24-25 December and was "not pleased" with comments he had heard concerning LIRING/3. He recommended that L/3 see the Chief LaGas soon as possible" to put the record straight concerning the circumstances surrounding his arrest and especially his subsequent release. Suarez intimated that the Chief IRING apparently favored the version siven ty Perzabal, with whose in-laws he was on very close personal terms. LIRING/3 told Rowton that he planned to try again to meet privately with the Chief HaING on the morning of 31 December, 1958.

2. 
4. In reply to Roston's questions concerning the identity of the following names that appear in the letters to him from Karta Barrios de León, LIXING/3 sade the following clarifications:

1) "Los canchitcs" and "Los patojos" refer to Juan and Miguel León Barrios.
2) "Elsa" is the true name of the eldest León Barrios sister (apparent age 25).
3) "La negra" is a León Barrios sister aged about 14.
4) "La chiquita" is a six-year-old sister of the León Barrios brothers.
5) "Felissa" is the novia of Juár csé León Barrios.
6) "Yuri" is a child, probably of Faria Elena, who is a close friend and possibly relative of the Leba Barrics farily.
7) La Koralta" and "Cari" whose identity 1/3 Lever learned are both active members of FAR who frequently visited the León Barrios brothers and acted as FÅR couriers.

5. LIRING/3 told Roston that as regards the per proposed revisit to Guatemala, he was prepared to discuss this with howton and would be willing to undertake the hazardous mission, "if there were no other alternative", but that in any case careful plans would have to be worked out especially with regard to communications, if Routen hoped to profit by L/3's rezewed involvement with FAR in Guatemala.

Subject: LIGING/3 Report of Meeting at PAR Safehouse.

1.  At 2100 on 1/1/69 at the Robin Restaurant Llki. G/3 reported to Rowton that he went, as requested by "Romulo", to Calle Coahuila 221 (across froa #oolworths near the corner of Insurgentes Sur) and found "Rómulo" in apartment 12 in the company of two other persons, previously unknown to LIRING/3. Both appeared younger than "Rózulo" and one could easily be his brother because of the physical resemblance. The other, apparent age 25, light skinned, who was introduced simply as an Ecuadorian, had a good Guatemalan accent, and revealed in his remarks an excellent knowledge of Guatemala. The Ecuadorian, who had the most pleasant personality of the three, remarked during the conversation that he had been imprisoned in the old penitentiary in Guatemala City and subsequently "thrown" over the DODGEL Co Saivacor.

2.  LIRING/3 told Rowton that the small apartment contained nothing that he could see but a table and several chairs and was obviously a safehouse rather than a residence. "Rómulo later co-firmed this when he told L/3 that they would have to meet there in the future only by appointment since they did not live there but came only from time to time to talk. As a result, LIRING/3 made a date with them for 1600 on Friday, 3/1/69, et which time he, L/3, would come to the apartment. "Rómulo" promised to wait for him at the entrance to the apartment building so that 1/3 would not have to ring the bell and wait outside the door unnecessarily.

3.  During the friendly discussion that ensued in the apartment, 1/3 took the line previously agreed on with Rowton with apparent success. The young Ecuadorian showed his approval by nodding his head several times, when L/3 outlines his reasons for not accepting at once the proposal to return to Guatemala. "Romulo" was less sympathetic, and when 1/3 stated that he felt it necessary in any case to travel first to PBAUMEN to get his wife settuled "Rómuio" shrugged his shoulders, remarking, "But can't she get by herself." 1/3 then offerred to be of any service while in FBRUEEN, but did not receive any positive reaction. "Romulo" responded simply with a "Yes, we'll see." L/3 made sure to drop the statement that he was planning as a matter of fact to see LIRING/9 the following morning to talk about the trip which 1/9 himself had already volunteered to arrange.

4.  Then the subject of Ferzabal's calumnies against 1/3 came up toward the end of the conversation, "Rómulo" told L/3: "Don't worry aqout that any more. A guatemalan, whom you don't know, will take care of that matter 'de una vez' 1/3 told Rowton he felt this remark was too full of forebading for him to ask for details. He agreed to come again to the apartment at 1600 on 3/1/69.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

1 January, 1958

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Address of Kario Kendez, aka "Rómulo".

1.  LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 1000 cn 1/1/69 at the Robin Zestaurant that he had not succeeded in seeing the Chief LIRING as he had hoped the previous morning since the latter did not appear at his office by 1000, when LIRING/3 had to leave to make the contact with "acmulo" at tis apart- ment. LIRING/3 continued to Rewton that when he arrived at his apartment about 1015 he found a note from "Romulo" asking him to come to the follow- ing address at between 1130-1200 the following day ( 1 January, 1959;:

Calle Coahuila 221.

2.  Roston therefore made ancther date with LIRING/3 for that sase evening at 2000 at the notice to get this moot- ing. Eceton showei LIRING/3 the two pictures passed tohim by the Station of persons suspected of being "Rómulo" and the fat colleague. LIRING/3 told Roston that he could see no resemblance to either person, but he felt that the photo of the stoot person corresponded to the description of the "Pavel" he was supposed to meet. He recalled that at the time the León Barrios brothers told him they would arrange for "Favel" to contact hin in Mexico City uppa his return, they showed him a rather poor reproduction of a picture of Pavel that had appeared in the local press following a gunfight that Favel had had on the border while crossing into Mexico.

3.  Roston then expressed to LIRING/3 his grave reservations concerting any the proposed travel of 1/3 to Guatemala in the company of his new FAR friends. Rowton pointed out that such a trip would be extremely risky for 1/3 personally with little hope of any worthwhile production for Borton. LIRING/3 agreed and said that he felt he would have to continue to stall, even at the risk of alienating the affections and confidence of his new contacts. Rowton suggested that L/3 tell them that before he could possibly consider such a return trip he would have to visit FERUMEN with his wife and child to get then settled there so that they would not again be exposed to the difficulties they suffered during his last trip - financial as well as psychological. This would give L/3 at least another sonth before he would be faced with the trip. Rowton added that 1/3 should offer to do "everything possible" in Mexico for his friends, reviewing for them his knowledge and experience of the border areas, his service in the navy as vell as his reasonably good knowledge of photography.

4.  Rowton then stressed that 1/3 should assume that everything, at least in summary form, that he discussed with the FAR officials he was in contact with would directly or indirectly be reported to the LINING office, and that hence he should play it straight" with both sides.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

8 January,1969

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Allegation of WoPlak Affiliation.

1. At 1000 on 7 January, 1969, at the restaurant of the Camino Real Hotel LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that he had just received three letters from Harta Barrics de León, the mother of the León Parrios brothers (Miguel and Juán) whom he had originally set during his confinement in Guatemala City. He gave the original letters, Bowton's translation of which is attached, to Roston to copy and study. LIRING/3 appeared genuinely shaken at the revlation in the second paragraph of the letter, dated 29/12/68, that the "wan on the bicycle" (Carlos Perzabal) had written in his letter to Karta that LIRING/3 was "working for another company (NCFIRM) and that Morte should not confide in onothing TTHTC/2 micht unite to how & TTHTC/3 told Roxton that he had suspected that Perzabal had accused him of perhaps causing the arrest, but he never dreamed that Ferzabal would go so far as to accuse hiz outright of being a SCZIRäM agent.

2. LIRING/3 then speculated that Ferzabal could not have done such a series thing of his own initiative, but cust necessarily have been inspired by some outside source, most probably the LIRING establishment. He continued that he therefore felt it more necessary than ever to put the LIRING Chief "up against the wall" and force his to admit his complicity. LIRING/3 added that he had seen "Rómulo" on 3 Jantary as planned and had told him about the letter from Marta and Ferzabal's treachery. According to LIKING/3 "Rómulo" became indignant and volunteered to accompany LIRING/3 to the LIRING establishment to have the whole thing out once and for all. LIKING/3 appeared so čisturbed at the unexpected news that howton found it impossible to check with him on the exact time and place he allegedly met "Rómulo" on Friday, 3/1/69. shen Rowton stated that he felt it very important to iden- tify "Rómulo" positively (Rowton alleged that he had access to the Gober- nación "mug file" of persons wanted by the Guatemalan Government and given to the Mexicans for identification), LIRING/3 volunteered to arrange to meet "Rómulo" somewhere in public as soon as possible so that Boston could get a good look at him ( as he had pretiously done in the case of "Garcia").

3. Roxton advised LIRING/3 not under any circumstances to attempt to lure "Rómulo" to any public place, especially since the latter had estab- lished a pattern of meeting with him in a safehouse, but simply to tell Rowton the next time he was invited to visit the safehouse and Kowton bould cover the place from as convenient a spot as possible (e.g. Woolwork's across the street). Kosten also encouraged toRING/3 to talk again with LIRING/9 rahher than the Chief LIRING IN THE hope of more production.

PERUMER/The LIRING-3 Operation

Action Required: FYI

Reference : HHMA-36114, 27 December 1968

1. Forwarded herewith as attachment #1 are eight reports prepared by Wallace B. ROVTON on the latest developments of the LIRING-3 operation. The most important of these are reviewed below.

a. "Romulo," who later described himself as Mario *MENDEZ*, appeared on the scene as the liaison man between LIRING-3 and the Guatemalan FAR. Humberto *GONZALEZ* Vega, whom *MENDEZ* called "El Gato," apparently made initial contact with LIRING-3 on his own initiative. *MENDEZ* said that "El Gato" was a "good element" but emphasized that he (*MENDEZ*) would be the person LIRING-3 would deal with on FAR matters. A copy of the sketch of *MENDEZ* drawn by LIRING-3 was shown by the Station to LIREL-2. The latter, without any hesitation, identified it as Javier *CONTRERAS*, leading FAR representative

in Mexico and a suspected PBZUMEN contact. The Station had the LIBRACE team cover the entrance of the building where BLADEZ and other FAA members have an apartment they use for clandestine meetings with LIRING-3. Despite the fact that the team knows LIKING-3 from previous surveillance and that a copy of LIAZAG-3's sketch of MAYO was also provided, the LIEMBRACES spotted neither man. The Station naturally plans to cover another meeting and is also exploring the possibility of determining who rented the apartment and from whom. It is of some interest to note that MANDEZ, although he gave LIRINO-3 the agreed upon recognition signal, may still not be the "Pavel" LIZING-3 was told he would meet. LIRING-3 was shown a photograph of Oscar Arturo PERIZ Ramirez (known to have serviced a letter drop in mexico City used by michelle Jeannette FIRK before her death in Guatemala). LIRING 3. thought it looked like a poor print of a photograph of "Pavel" shown to him while still incarcerated.

c. LIRING-3 is apparently still suspicious in the eyes of the PRZUMENERS. He has received several letters (see paragraph 2) from members of the FAR in Guatemala warning him that adverse rumors (some of them calling him a COPIAN agent) have been circulated in that country by Carlos PERZABAL Harcue. Knowing that PERZABAL's father-in-law is a close friend of Chief, LIRING, LIRING-3 sourced the rumors to the LIRING headman. He first took up the matter of the accusations made against him with LIRING-3. The letter said there was nothing to this, but, and there was a but, LIRING-9 reminded LIRING-3 that in the past he had been connected "with a person of mysterious and suspicious affiliations," a clear reference to ROWTON, LIRING-3's Greek friend. Von LIRING-3 insisted he wanted to discuss the matter of the allegations made against him directly with Chief, LIRING, LIZING-9 promised to make an appointment for him. This appointment, however, never materialized. That Chief, LIBING may have spread the allegations made against LIRING-3 by PERZABAL was confirmed by Rolando *SUAREZ (see ROWTON's report dated 31 December). LIRING-3 also took up the matter of the PERZABAL denunciations with HENDEZ, who told him that the FAR had paid no attention to them and oven accompanied LIRING-3 to PLAZABAL'S house. LIRING-3, however, made the mistake of giving his name when asked who was calling. The result, as could be expected, was that PDIZABAL was "not in." MANDI agreed to accompany LIRING-3 to LIRING to talk to its Chief, but he warned LIRIN-3 not to make accusations without proof. MENDEZ, incidentally, does not appear to be pro-PBRUNEM. This is interesting in view of the fact that CONTE CHAS, with whom he may be identical, is a suspected contact of the PBRUNEVERS.

c. So far, it does not seem that the FAR has been greatly disturbed by the accusations made against LIRING-3. In fact, and the two other FAR members LIHING-3 met on 1 January have urged LIRING-3 to join them in the hills of Guatemala, where guerrilla warfare, they said, will soon be

intensified. They did not hide that their purpose was to broadcast LIRING-3's name and the fact that a Mexican had joined their fight. This was apparently to appeal to the Mexican left and gain their support. While LIRING-3 has declared himself ready to go back to Guatemala (if this was what BOSTON wanted him to do), he did not need BOSTON to decide that broadcasting his name from the jungles of Guatemala was not a thing he wanted anyone to do. At Station directive, LIRING-3 pointed out that after his recent imprisonment he had to take care of his wife before doing any more for the cause. The best way to do this was to take LIRING-4 to FERUMEX and leave her with relatives. This led LIBING-3 to ask what, if anything, he could do for the FAR in Mexico. So far, however, his FAR friends have not risen to.

2. Forwarded under separate cover as attachment #2 are the following documents:

a. A copy of a letter from Oscar Moises SHOLDAN Espinoza.

b. A translation and a copy of a letter, dated December 1968, from Marta BARRIOS.

c. Translations and copies of letters from Marta BARRIOS to LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 dated 25 December and from "Violeta" dated 17 November.

d. Copies of two letters and two postcards received by LIRING-3 from Rafael and Rigoberto ARGUETA Alvarado dated 10 December (see ROWTON's report of 19 December).

e. A copy of the letter sent by LIRING-3 to Carlos PERZAKAL Marcue with copies for the Mexican and Spanish Communist Parties. This letter is dated 25 December.

f. A copy of an article written by LIRING-3 and published in a Mexican magazine. The date, number, and name of the magazine are marked on the copy.

g. A copy of the note written by Jacobo RODRIGUEZ Padilla (a longtime member of the Guatemalan Communist Party living in Mexico) introducing Carlos LOPEZ (who was an important FAR leader in Guatemala until he came to Mexico in late 1963).

h. A copy of an article which appeared in a Chiapas newspaper announcing LIRING-3's release.

Guatemala, December, 1968.
Dear Carlos:
Excuse me for not having replied to yours of 12 November until today, but the affairs of the "patojos" keep me on the go and besides I have been sick and upset and I keep forgetting everything. That's the reason I haven't put a date on this letter; you won't believe it but I write two letters that never got off, but it's true. We hope that you are as well as ever with your family.

I have to tell you that the "hombre de la bicicleta" wrote me last week and that I am a little peeved at him because he speaks ill of you. You should move cautiously, but don't think that it's a problem with us - we don't believe it. We feel that it's from fear. I lost his address and for that reason don't intend to write to him.

"El vigotudo" sends you regards; la negra a warm embrace; la chiquita a kiss; Elsa.Felisacari, Maria Elena, Guri and the "patojos" many regards and embraces for the Chirstmas holidays. The "patojos" are still in the "pina" so they couldn't come. We'll see whether they can be with us the 24th; if not we'll have to go there to be with them. In any case I'll let you know when they come here.

So long with many best wishes and congratulations to you and your wife and children. Excuse the long and boring letter.

So long Carlos,
/s/ Marta

Gautemala, 29. December, 1962.

Carlos,

I'm writing this after returning from the farm where I had a chat with "ics catches"; your three letters came the same day, as well as the postcard which is very attractive. Thanks for all your trouble. In yours of the 20th you ask me to send a letter to the "E.C." but I don't understand where you mean, and to wich, since I don't recognize those initials. Please explain to me clearly what you mean so that I can comply.

As to the letter from the "man on the bicycle", I mislaid it since I didn't like what it said, but if I can locate it I'll send it to you, as the "patojos" told me to from the beginning, so that you can have an exact account of it. I, however, thought the weight they gave to it exaggerated. In any case he wrote to tell me that you were working for another company (OTA) and for that reason I shouldn't confide in anything that you might write to me. But I'm very sincere in that respect and for that reason I got very angry. Consider this, that when you both were here, the mother of that person was very nice to me, lavishing flattery and gifts on me, for which I am sincerely grateful and do not forget, but his action doesn't seem (honest) to me. We all have to be loyal and faithful to our convictions and not be shameless with respect to our comrades; we have to be responsible in all our actions.

I haven't been able to write until today since I'm running around town arranging things. All this must be boring to you. Receive greetings from Miguel, chiquita, negra, Maria, Felisa, my grandson, Elsita, Gorditaand Cari. Also my own "abrazos" and good wishes.

/s/ Marta

Carlos: Lesbia ("La Negrita") sends you fond remembrances. Excuse the red pen and the bad handwriting. Imagine! you fooled all of us since we thought you had made the Christmas card yourself -since you paint so well, but you's not going to believe that. I'm writing you just a few lines because mamá didn't leave me much space. Greetings to your wife and children, even though I haven't had the pleasure of meeting them. So long, /s/ Lesbia

I was happy to learn that the person who wrote to me was you; it was quite a practical joke when I found out that it was really Carlos who was writing. Tell him that the letter he sent with the clippings has not yet been received.

Many "abrazos" and endearments from your friend

Carlos,

I send you my best, wishing that you and your family are well. Everything here is the same as when you were with us. We learned that your trip was good in all respects.

You can settle with the "Chino" the accounts you left here. He's going to send you two postcards that are very interesting. I trust you'll appreciate how difficult it was for us to find them among so many attractive cards we have here.

You can write to Doña Luisa. Greetings and "hasta pronto."

The above is one of the many oversights of Doña Luisa. Excuse it.

ATTACHMENT #25
HNNA-36184

Sr. C.ec.on

En el No. 533 correspondiente a 27 de
viembre al presente año, pudimos ver
se recolectara revista una carta mia sobre
"Granja penal Paven" en Guatemala. En
donde estuve confinado por unos meses. En
el No. 533 del 18 de diciembre, la cita la
Sra. Morínos Mina, agregada de Prensa -no
Imagino que la embajada de Guatemala
en México- responde a ella.

Consideramos que su respuesta no se ape
ga a la realidad, pues lógicamente no pu
eden comparar un centro como la colonia Menonita

de hacer caso a los que elogian el régimen. En
conciencia que despenca, me permito hacer las
aclaraciones que por cierto ello me pinta en
su carta. Por lo tanto ruego a usted de la
manera más atenta se sirva dar a la publi
cación las siguientes líneas:

Srita. Cleric Menéndez Mina
Agregada de Prensa de Guatemala.

Evidentemente que nadie quiere publicar
la realidad de ese manicomio maravillos, pero es
un negocio a la reeducación y una gran filan
tropía. Quiero decir que no hay a Guate
mala en plan de reformador como usted dice.
Los motivos de mi detención son ya públi
cos, sostenidos son ya públicamente y no voy a repetirlo ahora
ya. Solo debe usted saber que la ASISTEN
CIA me concedió libertad aministiada es ab
suelto de los delitos que se me imputaban. ABSUEL
TO quiere decir libre de cargos y cuya abso
lusión me concedió libertad aministiada es de
cir, que no se encontraron pruebas del falso
delito del que la policía me acusa. Por lo tan
to el objetivo de reformador no me corres
ponde.

Sostengo que la "granja penal Paven" es
un campo de concentración y que no reúne
ni una sola de las condiciones de una pri
sión común y corriente. Lo que escribía en
ella es real y no exageré en nada. Insisto en
que la "granja" sustituye a la antigua Pe
nitenciaria que fue demolida. Eso es cierto
y esto sí se negó improcedentemente a su esta
blecimiento. Probablemente los planes de sus
constructores así como la opinión de los paí
ses que mandan, contemplaban el estable
cimiento de granjas penitenciarias autónomas
pero sí es que tuvieron esa idea no la hicie
sen realidad.

En esa "granja" no existe sino un nue
vo estilo sobre la vieja penitenciaria. Las con
diciones de vida son infrahumanas y como dije
ya sostengo lo escrito en mi anterior carta.
Le propongo que el gobierno de su país per
mita la visita de periodistas y correspon
sales extranjeros ten ningún otro país se concederían a
que visitaran sus centros de reclusión; exi
silencia que fue demolida. Esa es cierta
y esto sí se negó improcedentemente a su esta
blecimiento. Probablemente los planes de sus
constructores así como la opinión de los paí
ses que mandan, contemplaban el estable
cimiento de granjas penitenciarias autónomas
pero sí es que tuvieron esa idea no la hicie
sen realidad.

En esa "granja" no existe sino un nue
vo estilo sobre la vieja penitenciaria. Las con
diciones de vida son infrahumanas y como dije
ya sostengo lo escrito en mi anterior carta.
Le propongo que el gobierno de su país per
mita la visita de periodistas y correspon
sales extranjeros ten ningún otro país se concederían a
que visitaran sus centros de reclusión; exi
sten unos 1000 aproximadamente
en todas las prisiones del país. Son en cambio
más de 4,000 los asesinados por el actual régi
men. Sobre estos muertos y la violencia que
vive hoy hay suficiente información y le
gislación a la Comisión por los Derechos Hu
manos de la ONU, donde existen numerosos
datos muy concretos.

Sobre que "personajes como yo" son los
que penan en entredicho la buena amistad
y relaciones entre pueblos y gobiernos. No creo que exagera Sali Absuelto y no soy
"redentor" ni un "sacrificado" como us
sted me nombra. El fallo de las leyes de su
país confirma esto.

Atentamente:

Carlos Jurado.

## 2. Operations in PBRUMEN and Against Visiting PERUKEN Officials:

A. LIAGILE-1: LIAGILE-1 came to Mexico on 19 October and returned to PERUMEN on 1 November, but he did not contact the Station. (See KMEXICO CITY-7974.)

B. LICARD-1: LICARD-1 returned from his TDY to Madrid in October. His mission was unsuccessful. The Madrid Station provided detailed reports on this operation.

C. LISAGA-1: LISAGA-1 returned to Mexico on 25 November 1968. He remained in Mexico to receive special training and to undergo debriefing by a Eeadquarters TDier until 9 December, when he returned to PBRUMEN.

D. Subject of MEXICO CITY-6266: LIADLIB-1 finished his debriefing of Subject during this period. (See HMMA-35618 )

E. HAGLIDER-1: HAGLIDER-1 did not return to Mexico during this period.

F. YJHAIT-2: YJWAIT-2 did not return to Mexico during this period.

G. Subject of MEXICO CITY-7595: Subject defected to the Mexicans during the Olympics. The Station arranged for a press conference through LITAMIL-3. LITAMIL-3's debriefing revealed that Subject did not have any intelligence of value. (See also MEXICO CITY-7621.)

H. ANTILLOS-1: ATILLOW-1 arrived in Mexico on 22 November and returned to PBRUMEN on 2 December. FRADYER could not meet him as he was at Headquarters on TDY. (See XEXICO CITY-8215 and -8335.)

## 3. Active Leads to Prospects in PBRUMEN:

A. Subject of MEXICO CITY-5442: LICOMET-2 received a call from Subject on 24 November asking hin to take care of two friends who were visiting Mexico fron PBRUMEN. During the same call, Subject indicated he would be coming to Mexico City soon on vacation and would notify LICONET-2 of the exact date and details.

B. ANICARUS-1: After enlisting the cooperation cf AMICARUS-3 in Veracruz, the Station is awaiting the arrival of AMICARUS-1, scheduled to transit Mexico City from PBRUMEN, to re-establish contact between the two and have AMICARUS-3 develop AMICARUS-1. (See MEXICO CITY-8136, et cetera.)

C. ANCAJOLE-2: Per MEXICO CITY-745-1 and -7453, ANCAJOLE-1 was scheduled to visit Mexico from PBRUMEN. However, his father at the last minute reportedly "blocked" his departure. (See also MEXICO CITY-7574 and.-7622.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

## Continuation of Dispatch

SECRET/RYBAT HEMA - 35185

D. LIALMANAC-1: LIALMANAC-1 told ROTTOX on 23 November that he is a close, long-time friend of the Subject of HMA-36016. He says now he believes he can develop a close relationship with QUMOON, Mexico City.

E. Subject of MEXICO CITY-7946: The Station is cooperating with LNERGO in preparing for the arrival of Subject's son in Mexico. The Station has assisted in getting a Mexican visa for the son. The son arrived in Mexico on 2 December, but it has not yet been determined whether he is willing to be contacted and, hopefully, debriefed.

4. Legal Travelers to PBRUMEN:

A. LIRING-4: According to LIRING-3, LIRING-4 is in no condition to accept any assignment or instructions for a trip to PBRUMEN. There is, however, some possibility that LIRING-3 may go to PBRUMEN on a "cultural" mission, at which time he will report directly to PBRUMEN officials on his activities in Guatemala. LIRING-9 has reiterated that he wants both LIRING-3 and LIRING-4 to go. but has not suggested dates for this travel. (See MEXICO CITY-8159 and -8228.)

B. LIRENO-2: LIRENO-2's papers are finally in order, and she has indicated that she is still willing to travel to PERUYEN. However, the recent death of her mother, as well as the recent incarceration of her son (in a frame-up by his employer - see MEXICO CITY-8182), has brought her to a physical and psychological low. The Station is allowing ber time to recuperate before raising the question again.

C. LIANKLE-1: LIANKLE-1 has not yet settled in Mexico City. There was no contact with her during this period.

D. LIARM-1: Per MEXICO CITY-7433, LIARM-1 was met during the Olympics, but did not have access to much information of value. (See MEXICO CITI-7563 and -7741.) In spite of the fact that he was in daily contact with PBRUMEN participants, some of whom spent considerable time with him, he came up with virtually nothing. The Station, at present; has no contact with LIARM-1, who has returned to the Monterrey area.

E. Subject of MEXICO CITY-5853 (News contact of LITAMIL-3): Subject has been reapproached about making a trip to PBRUNEN now that the Olympics are over. He has indicated his willingness to make such a trip now. LITAMIL-3 is arranging a meeting between Subject and a Station Case Officer.

F. LIRENO-8: On 17 October LIRENO-8 was instructed to actively arrange for a trip to PERUMEN, and, if he goes, to see about taking some courses in that country. (See MEXICO CITY-7738 and HMA-35593.). In the meantime, he has become completely integrated into the PBRUMEN Consulate and cultural institute in his town. In this capacity he will be in a position to report on PBRUMEN activities in that area.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

# CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

SECRET/RYBAT   36185

G. Subject of HERA-35516: The Station is still planning to have PORTON explore the feasibility of approaching Subject and using him as an eventual source in PERUKER, where, by the nature of his function, he still maintains contacts. (See HERA-35516.)

H. AUSTRUT-16: Subject traveled to PEZUCHEN on 18 October 1968 and returned on 1 November. On her return to Mexico she was debriefed by Henry J. SLOMAN, who came to Mexico on TDY for this purpose. The results of this debriefing were received in UFAA-355.

I. Subject of MEXICO CITY-8319: LITAINT-3 was contacted by Subject, who returned from PEZUCHEN on 2 December. Subject was debriefed by a Station Case Officer on the current status of the relationship between his organization and the PERCHEN Government, and on other requirements given him before his departure for PERUHEN. The most promising factor in this operation is the fact that four of his subordinates will be coming out for a conference in April 1969. Subject promised to give the Station access to any or all of these individuals.

5. Technical Penetration and Coverage of LIRING and the Residences of LIRING Personnel:

A. MKTRAP in Chief, LIRING's Residence: MEXICO CITY-7982 reported on the difficulties encountered in trying to have a LIRISK unit installed in the LIHACK-4 LD. The Station made its own LIRISK installation on 23 November. (See MEXICO CITY-8182.) All attempts to activate the MKTRAP have so far been unsuccessful. (Sec MEXICO CITY-8303.)

B. LISANDAN: LISANDAN coverage of BAKER continued. EASY was lost on 9 October as a result of a routine installation in the same building by the LIRISK company. Attempts to activate EAST from LISARI were unsuccessful. (See MEXICO CITY-7598 and -8232.)

C. LIENVOY: LIENVOY coverage has remained unchanged. The LIRING Commercial line still has not been reconnected.

D. LIFEAT: LIFEAT coverage of LIRING-21 was discontinued on 15 November for security reasons. The coverage was renewed on 6 December.

E. LIONION: LIONION-1 continued to perform his photographic and audio duties. His ability now to identify people by name by monitoring DOG is particularly useful.

F. LIROSIN: LIROSIN-1 was kept on full salary during the period. In late November he was given the assignment of renting a new LP which was spotted by LITAINT-2. He successfully rented this LP on 4 December, after LIRENO-1 laid the groundwork, and will move into it on 18 December 1968. This will be the base for an audio operation against LIRING-2, *LIRING-9, and LIRING-13.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

## CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

G. Trash Operation: The trash operation was not reactivated during this period.

H. Audio Against the Residences of LIRING-21 and LIRING-24: Via LIREALM-1 the Station located empty apartments in the same buildings where these two LIRING officers live. Attempts to rent at least one of these for an audio operation proved difficult in view of the need for a cosigner and finding suitable people to move in. LIROSIN-1 was goi:g to attempt to make some arrangement when the LP described in subparagraph 5F turned up. The Station' decided the latter was of higher priority and discontinued its efforts to rent the apartments next to LIRING-21 and LIRING-24.

6. Physical Penetration and Coverage of LIRING:

A. PBRUMEN Deputy in Merida: This target left PCS on 15 November 1968. (See MEXICO CITY-8148.)

B. LITAMIL-7: The Station had no contact with LITAMIL-7 during this period. She was, however, seen chatting with LIRING members on several occasions. She was not observed visiting LIRING.

C. Female Access Agent (Subject of MEXICO CITY-5988): No contact was established during this period.

D. LIRING-3/LIRING-4: On 29 October ROTTON let LIRING-3 after his release from jail. The results of the initial debriefing were cabled in MEXICO CITY-7900. LIRING-3 indicated that LIRING-4 was very nervous and upset, and that he wanted all his own activity and association with RONTON to be kept from her. LIRING-3 has been meeting fairly frequently with LIRING-9, who has been debriefing him on his encarceration in Guatemala. (See MEXICO CITY-8159 and -8228.)

E. PBRUMEN Maids: The Station decided to mount an operation against the PBRUMEN maids, and selected LIEMBRACE-3 as a suitable access agent. (See MEXICO CITY-7861.) The Station is in the process of turning LIEMBRACE-3 over to LIREALM-1, who will be the outside Case Officer on this operation. (See also MEXICO CITY-8124.)

F. Chief, LIRING: The Station has corresponded with Headquarters about a false flag cold approach against Chief, LIRING. This still is in the exploratory stages. (See MEXICO CITY-8242.)

7. Harassment of LIRING: There were no new Huarache leaflets put out during this period.

8. LICONET Debriefing Center: MEXICO CITY-8066 reported that the charitable sponsorship covering the overt activities of the debriefing center ended on 31 October 1968 and that the extra financial cover for the office space would end 30 November. Headquarters' assistance was requested in resolving this problem. (See also MEXICO CITY--8179 and -8287.) HMMA-35887 forwarded more detailed LICONET-2 reports on the LICONET cover problem.

HMA- 36185

9. QUIOON: There were no operations against QUMOON during this period. QUMOON's activity in Mexico remained normal.

10. Double Agents: LISASSY-1 returned from his European trip on 17 November and was recontacted by LIRING-9, who levied requirements on him as reported in MEXICO CITY-8339. LISASSY-1 continues to have difficulty satisfying LIRING-9 requests for information on the activities of the PBRUMEN community in Mexico City and Miai. The CI aspect of the LISASSY-1 operation was virtually at a standstill for two reasons: first, at one time or another, either LIRING-9 or LISASSY-1 was out of Mexico; and second, the Station has been unable to come up with information which LISASSY-1 could pass to LIRING-9. In this last respect, LISASSY-1 continues to be an excellent channel of WOFIRE-controlled information to the PBRUMEN Government via LIRING-9.

11. Operations Against PBRUMEN Subversive Activities in Latin America:

A. LIRING-3: See MEXICO CITY-7900 for ROSTON'S initial derivation of LIRING-3 on conditions in Guatemala. MEXICO CITY-7945 reported that LIRING-3 received a letter from Guatemala which he interpreted as a check on a new commo channel between the Guatemalan rebels and him. LIRING-3 reported at length to LIRING-9 on his contacts with FAR members while in jail. At LIRING-3's suggestion, LIRING-9 may send LIRING-3 to PBRUMEN to make a personal report on this. (See MEXICO CITY-8159.) More detailed reports were forwarded in HMA-35905. HMMA-35904 forwarded a report of LIRING-3's imprisonment in Guatemala.

B. Letter Drops: The PBRUMEN letter drops being covered by the Station only produced one interesting letter during this period. (See HMMA-35873.) The Station suggested that Headquarters follow up on the lead provided.

C. LIRING-7: LIRING-7 continued to see his Mexican leftist student "friends" during this period. (See HMMA-35823.) He also escorted a high-ranking member of the Orthodox Church during a visit to Mexico. One intelligence dissemination was made on the basis of information produced by LIRING-7 during this visit.

D. LIHACK-4: When he was in jail in mid-November, LIHACK-4 was approached by some Mexicans arrested in connection with the student disturbances. He was asked to take a walkie-type radio into jail for their commo, and was asked if he would be willing to assist them with his ham radio equipment for direct commo between the revolutionaries and PBRUMEN, since going through LIRING was not satisfactory. The Station is taking a wait-and-see attitude to see how this develops. (See MEXICO CITY-8213.)

E. Subject of HMMA-35572: Via LIFEAT, LIENTRAP, and the LIEMBRACES, the Station identified a Mexican student contact of LIRING. Background information on this person, including photos, was passed to the LITEMPOS on 21 November 1965 with a suggestion that they arrest and interrogate the person. (See HMMA-35872 for details.)

12. Miscellaneous:

A. AMECOK-3: AMECOK-3 is employed by a local Mexican television station and apparently does not intend to return to PBRUMEN. The Station had no ops contact with AMECOK-3 during the period of this report. He planned to travel to the United States to cover the Apollo/8 launching at Cape Kennedy in late December 1968, but this was not definite.

B. Travel Control Information: LIFIRE, LICOMET, and LITENTO continued to provide this type of information.

C. PBRUMEN Fishing Fleet: There was no activity against this target. Several fishing boats, however, did seek shelter at Isla Mujeres, and on each occasion several crew members sought asylum. The LICOMETS were alerted each time to try to obtain debriefings of these men. (See MEXICO CITY-8039.)

D. MHVIPER: The LICUBELIS continued to provide QUMOON cargo manifests, and LIRENO-1 provided crew and ship manifests. The manifests were pouched to JMCOBRA and Headquarters for processing. (See HMMA-35912.)

E. AMDESTINE-1: AMDESTINE-1 was terminated per Headquarters direction. See MEXICO. CITY-7661, DIRECTOR-42579, and MEXICO CITY-7739.

F. ANDAUB-1: On 17 October ANDAUB-1 asked for assistance from LAPURE. (See MEXICO CITY-7709.) On 25 October he left Mexico for Miami, where he was met and handled by WH/Miami. (See JMCOBRA-1427.)

G. LIAMATOL-1: LIAMATOL-1 was met on 17 October 1968 and agreed to cooperate with the Case Officer by furnishing information on the activities of the PBRUMENers in the Veracruz area. LIAMATOL-1 requested that his main line of communication with the Station be through LIRENO-1 for security reasons. (See HMMA-35913 and -35917.)

H. Subject of MEXICO CITY-7515: The Station notified Headquarters of the arrival in Mexico of a person on the list of "40." The Station was asked to contact this Subject's brother to determine the present status of Subject. This was done, and the report submitted in MEXICO CITY-7754 indicated that he was content with his life in PBRUMEN and was not interested in contacts, even with his own brother, if there was to be pressure applied for him to remain outside PBRUMEN.

I. During a baseball game between PBRUMEN and the United States during November, the PBRUMEN players attacked several spectators. Through LITANIL-3 the Station is trying to arrange to have one of those attacked sue a LIRING employee. (See MEXICO CITY-8044, -8048, -8078, and -8285.) However, the Station-cleared lawyer ran into difficulties with the Mexican Government. Court authorities who passed the lawyer a transcript of the original charges against the LIRING employee advised the lawyer he

would be wasting his time on this case because orders
from an unidentified high Mexican Government official
indicated that the planned charges against the
employee would not be accepted for trial.

J. ANSTET-1: AUSTET-1 sent a letter to the
home of AMSTRUT-8, who in turn notified the Station
to come and pick it up. The contents of the letter
were forwarded to Headquarters in MEXICO CITY-8130.
This is a Headquarters case in which the Station
participates only as a letter drop via AUSTRUT-8.

13. As can be seen, all the above has been previously
    reported to Headquarters. In view of this, and the fact that
    the PBRUMEN Section, in addition, submits regular quarterly
    progress reports on its projects, it is felt that reporting
    on the Station's activities against the PBRUMEN target is
    inadequate. Therefore, the Station once more suggests that
    formal PBRUMEN Section monthly or bimonthly reports be
    discontinued. Please advise.

1. Forwarded attached are the two last contact reports written by Wallace B. ROWTON on LIRING-3 before ROWTON'S departure on TDT in late January 1969. These reports are dated 15 and 22 January. ALSO forwarded is another report by ROWTON, dated 28 November 1968, which the Station somehow failed to forward.

2. That LIRING has forwarded information to the Mexican Communist Party casting suspicion on LIRING-3's past activities did not come as a great shock. Heraclio ZEPEDA is known to the Station as a previous teacher at the University of Jalapa who said in 1960 that he would accept a teaching position in PBRUMEN, a country he has visited on several occasions at the invitation of its government. ZEPEDA also spent some time

in 1965 in the U.S.S.R., where he was described as Foreign Correspondent of *La Voz de Mexico*, an official organ of the Mexican Communist Party (see HMMA-27727, 24 November 1965). ZEPEDA apparently also visited Communist China. He appears to be well acquainted with LIRING-9. In view of the above, the Station instructed ROWTON to ask LIRING-3 to refrain from attempting to use ZEPEDA to obtain a "bootleg" copy of the LIRING letter to the Mexican Communist Party. The Station feels a copy of this letter would add little to the known fact that LIRING-3 is a person that LIRING continues to view as "suspect." LIONHEART has been asked for up-to-date informa- tion on ZEPEDA's Party position. Any information passed by LIONHEART will be forwarded to Headquarters.

ATTACHMENT #1
28 November, 1968 HIMA-36408

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Meeting with LIRING/9.

1. LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at 0915 on 27/11/63 that he had met with LIRING/9 at the LIRING establishment from about 1745 until 1900 on 26/11/63. He stated that he gave LIRING/9 his written report on his recent experiences in Guatemala and the conclusions be drew from talking with FAR members there. L/3 also stated that he did his best to assure L/9 that, although he sympathized with the laments of the León Barrios brothers, he was really on the PBRUMEN side and offered to do all he could to assist the LIRINGs in their attempts to assist the revolutionary forces. The following is Rowton's reconstruction of the conversation, based on LIRING/3's report:

L/3: "I'm sorry to be late, but I had to finish the report."

L/9: "Alright. I've been waiting here at the gate so there wouldn't be any further delay. Let's go to my office so we can talk privately."

Upon entering office, L/9 removes jacket and offers L/3 a seat in the office.

L/3: "Well, here's my report. I must apologize that it's in rough draft form. I had to write it rather hurriedly when my wife was not around. It's really just a series of badly organized thoughts and ideas but I'll be glad to explain. There's a great deal more, of course, that I could explain on the subject. Do you wish me to read it?"

L/9: "No, that's alright.

L/9 glances through the report and continues:

"I'll read it carefully later. I really didn't expect such a long report. I appreciate it. In the meantine, how are you doing in your personal affairs?"

L/3: "Well, as I told you last time, I'm very much up in the air at the moent. My exposition has started but is not going as well as can be expected - as well as I had hoped. You know, these things have their up's and down's. I'll sell some things, at least to cover my current expenses, but I'll really have to get better organized financially in the near future. The first problem that I'm really worried about is my wife, and I frankly feel that I must appeal to you for help."

L/9: "Of course. Well, what is the problem?"

L/3: "As you know, some time ago my wife and I had a series of unpleasant situations that alzost led to a separation.."

L/9: "Is that right! has it that serious?" "anything political?"

L/3: "No, absolutely not. It was purely a domestic misunderstanding. Now I feel that I must be very frank with you. I was probably responsible

because of an affair I had with the Carmen, - you know, the daughter of the doctor we just said hello to as we came in, the one talking with LIRING/2.

L/9: "Is that so? I had no ideal"

L/3: "Well I assumed you knew, since Carmen's father is a close friend of your Chief. In any case, it's over now, and I don't expect any trouble from that quarter. However, I feel that I should explain that I have an obligation to my wife for all that she did not me while I was in jail with no help from anyone, as you well know."

L/9: "Yes, it was difficult for her."

L/3: "You see, my wife is a sincere revolutionary, but she really doesn't want any part of the activity that a revolution demands. She's like so many others, including my former cell-mate and his famous uncle, who talk a great revolution, but fall apart when the chips are down."

L/9: "Yes, we know plenty of those types."

L/3: "Well, anyway, my wife wouldn't approve of my reinvolvement and keeps pressing me to take a *respectable* job which she knows I could obtain through my friends. What I really want to do is to somehow calm her down and arrange things so that she won't have any idea of my political plans. As you know her father is very ill in New York, and she is anxious to see him before he dies. I can arrange an exposition in Montreal and then ask the father to come up to see us there. That would get around the problem of a U.S. visa, which I'm sure neither of us could get."

L/9: "No. I'm sure you couldn't."

L/3: "The only problem is transportation. Air passage is too expensive and unfortunately there are no boats going from here. They all stop at New York. Don't you have regular ship traffic to Montreal, so that we could go that way?"

L/9: "Yes we do. I'm sure that could be arranged. I see no problem."

L/3: "We could then kill two birds with one stone, by stopping off at the PERUMEN capital enroute."

L/9: "Yes, there's really no problem."

L/3: "I hope you understand my problem. I'm in a very serious way financially at the moment, and couldn't possibly solve this problem myself without your help."

L/9: "Well, how are you doing otherwise - I mean in meeting living expenses?"

L/3: "Just getting by. You know we live on a very modest - day to day basis."

"The exposition is not going as well as I expected. But the problem I'm really concerned about is that of my wife."

L/9: "Let her go to FBRUMEN."

L/3: "what do you mean? I don't understand."

L/9: "Well, I mean with you, when you go."

L/3: "Oh, yes, I see. Of course. She can see her relatives and there won't be a problem. You know my wife was getting pretty desperate about seeing L/SIXXXXXXIIIIIIIEXYIIII her father and she even talked of going to the Northamerican Anbassy for a visa so that she could go to New York. Imagine that! I told it would be no use just a waste of time since she woiulnd get the visa."

L/9: "For heaven's sake, tell her not to go! That would create no end of Interrocations in tae FBRUMEN capital. Calm her downsby all means."

L/3: "Getting back to my report, as I said, cany points can be expanded."

L/9: "Yes. Let's zeet again on, say, Monday, at a time convenient for you."

L/3: "You know I have plenty of time now. I'm up in the air, as I said, not doing much - just the exposition. On the other hand you're a busy man. You set the time."

L/9: "I taink about 1000 would be good. Is that okay with you?"

L/3: "Yes. I'll be back."

L/9: "I'm gald you covered the important point as to what the FAR thinks of us. This is very important to us. Also you say that you expect a contact with one of them here?"

L/3: "Yes, with a certain 'Pavel' but I don't know when. I am in contact as you can see. They have been writing me more or less regularly since my de- parture." ( L/3 takes two letters from pocket and shows them, but L/9 makes no move to take them or read contents.)

L/9: "Well, I'll be waiting for you at 1000 on Monday."

2. LIRING/3 told Roston at a subsequent meeting (1100,28/11/6800) that when he returned home the previous evening, he found to his surprise a note slipped under the door from LIKING/9 asking him not to forget to come by at 1000 on Monday, 2 December, 1968.

Att #1 HANA-36408

13 January 1969

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Activities for the Period 7-13 January, 1969.

1. Rowton met with LIRING/3 at the Camino Real Restaurant at 1000 on 10 and 13 January. He reported the following developments in connection with the accusations made against him to Marta Barrios de León by Identity A

(a) On the evening of 8 January, 1969, Identity B called on him at his home unannounced and made an effort to smooth over the hard feelings that had arisen between LIRING/3 and her husband. She denied any knowledge of charges made by her husband against L/3 and claimed that she could not believe them in any case. When L/3 stated that he had definite proof in the form of a letter Identity B insisted on seeing it. L/3 (who had given the original letter to Rowton) stalled promising to produce the letter on 10 January in the presence of her husband. L/3 told Rowton that when he attempted to contact Iden B and her husband by phone on the morning of 10 January, he found the phone constantly busy and suspects that the receiver was left purposely off the hook.

(b) On the evening of 12 January, 1969, Arturo Serrano of the CPM, visited LIRING/3 at his home and told him that the Central Committee of the CPM had discussed his feud with Identity A, in response to the letter LIRING/3 had sent to it alleging that Iden A was maligning him unjustly. Serrano continued that the CC of the CFM had found the letter too vague to make any sense, but in any case could not take Iden A seriously. Serrano told L/3 that Iden A and Identity B had been recently formally expelled from the party for ideological reasons, but still had a number of friends willing to vouch for them. On the other hand Serrano stated that the CC of the CFM had received information "some time ago" from the LIRING office alleging that LIRING/3 had been acting in a suspicious manner, especially with regard to certain information he had provided concerning Julián López that "could not have come from a source other than the police." Serrano continued that although the CFM had no love for the LIRING office it nevertheless had to take such a report into consideration and the burden of proof was really on LIRING/3.

"ATT #I HIDDA-36105

22 January, 1959

Subject: LIRDIG/3 Report of Address of Guatemalan Refugees in Mexico City.

1. At 1000 on 21/1/69 LIRING/3 told Rowton that his old Guatemalan friend Jacobo Rodríquez Padilla was residing at Calle Veracruz 14, apartment, and that the Carlos Vega, whom Jacobo had sent to LIKING/3'8 home with a note asking 1/3 to help Tega, was living in the azotea (servant's) room belonging to Jacobo's apartment.

2. L/3 also reported that Carlos Vega again called on hin unarsounced et his anartment on 20 January.and asked him to arrange through his PBRUMEN friends to send a package of medicine to a son of Turcios who was living in the PBRUMEN capital. Vega also asked 1/3 to send two "very important" letters to PEREKEN through friends who could bypass the usual censorship. L/3 promised to do what he could and askud Vega to deliver the letters tohin on 25 January.

3. Because of the obvious possibility of provocation in this rather unexplained behavior of Carlos Vega ( he originally told L/3 that he was a close friend of Identity A ), Rowton agreed with 1/3 that no attempt should be made to open the letters and that they should be delivered promptly to the LIKING office for whatever disposition that establishment might wnat to make of the letters. L/3 promised to note carefully the addressees of the letters.

4. Powton told 1/3 that he would have to leave town for a visit to Monterrey and was not certain when he would be able to finish his business there. He made at date, however, for 1000, 3 February, at the Camino Real restaurant, and asked L/3 to return to the saze place at 1000 on 7 February in the event that Rowton did not appear at the first time and date.

Serrano, as a friend, advised L/3 to "take the bull by the horns" and send as much data as possitle to defend himself to all "important progressive" organizations. He volunteered to pass a copy of the letter from Marta Barrios to the CFM and 1/3's version of the arrest and detention as soon as he had prepared it.

2. In response to Rowton's query as to any other friends 1/3 might have in the CPM who might be able to obtain a copy of the original letter from the LIRING Office, LIRING/3 recalled that an old acquaintance from Chiapas, invited him to dinner and appeared anxious to re-establish contact with him. 1/3 told Rowton that he had known Zepeda in the PERUMEN capital soce six years previously and recalled that Zepeda had traveled and studied in Communist China and the Soviet Union before re- turing to Mexico. Zepeda recently told L/3 that he was employed in CCNASUPO and that he had written several articles favorable to L/3 in "Renovación" a daily newspaper he controlled in Tuxla-Gutierrez, Chiapas. L/3 told Howton that he later learned that the newspaper was actually owned by Hank González, general director of CONASUPO, who apparently had political ambitions.

3. Howton suggested that L/3 get in touch with Zepeda not only to determine why he had recontacted 1/3 after so long a time, but to ascertain his current relationship with the CPH and the LIRING office, if any.

4. LIRING/3 stated that he had not been recontacted by "Rómulo" and promised to advise Rowton in advance of a future meeting so that Rowton could cover it in the hope of getting a good look at the FAR representative.

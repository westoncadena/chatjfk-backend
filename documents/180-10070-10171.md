## Select Committee on Assassinations

### U.S. House of Representatives

3369 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

December 28, 1978

District Unemployment Compensation Board
6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N. W.
Washington, D. C. 20001

Gentlemen:

Mrs. Anne Paul Wilander is one of the staff members from the Select
Committee on Assassinations who is being terminated as of December 31, 1978,
per copy of attached letter.

To protect Mrs. Wilander's medical benefits until she secures employment,
she is being restored to the Committee's payroll on January 1, 1979 at the
minimum salary of $100.00 per month allowed under the Rules of the House.

While she will work two days per month to earn the $100.00, she is tech-
nically unemployed.

When she applies for unemployment benefits, the Clerk of the House will
probably respond to your inquiry that she is still employed but at a reduced
salary.

I wanted you to know what the facts are about her continued employment
so that nothing would interfere with her application for unemployment benefits
in case she is not able to secure new employment.

Sincerely yours,

![signature of Thomas Howarth]

Thomas Howarth
Deputy Staff Director
and Budget Officer

DATE: 7/25/75

1 - Mr. W. O. Cregar

This memorandum records for the record my efforts to meet with Mr. Thomas K. Latimer, Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, on 6/25/75.

On the late afternoon of 7/24/75, Mr. Benson Buffham, Deputy Director, National Security Agency (NSA), made available to Liaison Agent Brian Murphy a copy of a "Top Secret" memorandum dated 4/20/71, written by Louis W. Tordella, who was the then Deputy Director of NSA. This Memorandum for the Record, Subject: Shamrock, copy of which is attached, makes reference to a file entitled Shamrock available in the office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, United States Army.

Pursuant to your instructions on the evening of 7/24/75, I personally contacted Mr. Latimer at approximately 8:00 a.m., 7/25/75. In my conversation with Mr. Latimer, I noted that it was imperative that I see him as soon as possible regarding the contents of the Shamrock file. Mr. Latimer was informed that the Bureau was attempting to establish the line of authority relative to the Bureau's procurement of foreign government's cable traffic sent through international cable companies in the United States.

Mr. Latimer indicated that he had received a call from Mr. Buffham on the late afternoon of 7/24/75 and was aware of the Bureau's interest in reviewing certain memoranda in the Shamrock file. Mr. Latimer indicated that this was a matter of interest to the General Counsel of the Department of Defense and that he would have to consult with them.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

He advised me he would have somebody from the General Counsel's office, Department of Defense, promptly contact me regarding a review of this file by FBI personnel.

Not hearing from Mr. Latimer by the late morning of 7/25/75, I telephonically contacted his office. He was not available and I asked his secretary to have him return my call. Shortly before noon, Mr. Latimer returned my call and explained that he had discussed my request with Mr. "Marty" Hoffman (phonetic) of the Department of Defense. It was Latimer's understanding that Mr. Hoffman had gone to the White House to discuss my request with Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President. Latimer promised that he would telephonically recontact me as soon as he could establish contact with Hoffman. I again reiterated to Latimer that it was imperative the Bureau have access to the Shamrock file in order that we could advise the Attorney General as to its contents hoping to clearly demonstrate that both the then Attorney General Thomas Clark and, in fact, President Truman himself were aware of certain information contained in the Shamrock file. Mr. Latimer said he understood clearly what was at issue here and that he would get back to me as soon as possible.

At 1:50 p.m., 7/25/75, I again called Mr. Latimer's office and his secretary informed me that Mr. Latimer had stepped out of his office and that she would give him a message to call me as soon as he returned. As of 4:00 p.m., 7/25/75, I had not received a return call from Mr. Latimer.

# TOP SECRET/LIMITED DISTRIBUTION

MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: SHAMROCK

DISTRIBUTION LIMITED

20 April 1971

![illegible handwriting]

Mr. Buffham and I had an opportunity this morning to read the SHAMROCK file in ACSI. Major General Joe McChristian gave us permission to view it but once we had read it, after careful consideration he decided that he would not feel free to give NSA either the file or a duplicate copy without personal permission from SecDef inasmuch as SecDef had entrusted the file to ACSI in 1949. All of us agreed that an approach to the Secretary would be unnecessary and perhaps would generate too many questions. He did agree after sealing the file again to limit access to the Secretary of Defense on demand, the Director or the Deputy Director, NSA, on demand, Chief of ACSI, and the Chief of the SSO, ACSI. This would be noted on the side envelope.

The file contained memoranda for record, one prepared after a meeting in Forrestal's office attended by senior officials from ITT, Western Union, and RCA plus Marks Leva (then Defense General Counsel), Secretary Forrestal, and a representative from the Attorney General's office. Colonel Carter Clark from ACSI, who was present, prepared this memorandum. A subsequent meeting was held in Secretary Louis Johnson's office attended by representatives of the same three companies and I believe the Attorney General himself. In Mr. Johnson's own handwriting is a note to the effect that he showed the memorandum for record to President Truman and a note that TCC, apparently Attorney General Thomas Clark, either was present or had also discussed the matter with the President. Both memoranda indicated that the companies were informed that the work they were doing was of very great importance to the U.S. and every effort would be made to protect knowledge of its existence as well as to protect the companies in the event of exposure.

The material is filed under TS Control No. 516652-3-5 in the SSO ACSI files.

My memorandum dated 7/23/75 captioned as above advised you that this Bureau had received from Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 190 pages extracted from a 693-page document prepared by CIA citing instances wherein CIA believed some of its activities may have exceeded its legal mandate. Some of the CIA activities cited in this document include references to Bureau operations of an extremely sensitive nature, and it was also noted that the Senate Select Committee has had access to this document. It was recommended that pertinent pages extracted from the CIA document be routed to the respective Bureau Division and/or Intelligence Division Section believed to have an interest in the material contained therein for the purpose of fully identifying the subject matter and making an assessment as to whether any compromise to this Bureau's operation is involved.

This is to advise that the following pages from the document were furnished to the following Divisions and/or Sections of the Intelligence Division on the morning of 7/24/75 for the purpose of review, assessment, and recommendations, if any:

# PROJECT MOCKINGBIRD

Project Mockingbird, a telephone intercept activity, was conducted between 12 March 1963 and 15 June 1963, and targeted two Washington-based newsmen who, at the time, had been publishing news articles based on, and frequently quoting, classified materials of this Agency and others, including Top Secret and Special Intelligence.

Telephone intercept connections were installed at the newmen's office and at each of their homes, for a total of 3. The connections were established with the assistance of a telephone company official 'who responded to a personal request by the Director of Security, Col. Sheffield Edwards. Col. Edwards' authority for the activity was Mr. John A. McCone, Director of Central Intelligence. The latter conducted the activity in coordination with the Attorney General (Mr. Robert Kennedy), the Secretary of Defense (Mr. Robert McNamara), and the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (Gen. Joseph Carroll). In addition to Office of Security personnel directly involved in the intercepts and research of materials acquired therefrom, only 3 other Agency officials are on record as witting of the activity: the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (General Marshall S. Carter), the Inspector General (Lyman Kirkpatrick) and the General Counsel. (Mr. Lawrence Houston).

The intercept activity was particularly productive in identifying contacts of the newsmen, their method of operation and many of their sources of information. For example, it was determined that during the period they received data from 13 newsmen, 12 of whom were identified; 12 senators and 6 members of Congress, all identified; 21 Congressional staff members, of whom 11 were identified; 16 government employees, including a staff member of the White House, members of the Vice President's office, an Assistant Attorney General, and other well-placed individuals. A number of other sources were partially or tentatively identified, but the short span of the activity precluded positive identification. It was observed that through these contacts the newsmen actually received more classified and official data than they could use, and passed some of the stories to other newsmen for release, establishing that many "leaks" appearing under other by-lines were actually from the sources of the target newsmen.

Since the termination of Project Mockingbird, those materials related to it which were retained, have been maintained under strict security access of two Office of Security professionals.

SUBJECT: Soviet Defector

A Soviet defector, defected to a representative of this Agency in 1964. The responsibility for his exploitation was assigned to the then SR Division of the Clandestine Service and he was brought to this country. After initial interrogation by representatives of the SR Division, he was moved to a safehouse in Maryland, where he was confined and interrogated until 13 August 1965 when he was moved to a specially constructed "jail" in a remote wooded area at I-SOLATION. The SR Division was convinced that he was a dispatched agent but even after a long period of hostile interrogation was unable to prove their contention and he was confined at ISOLATION in an effort to convince him to "confess."

This Office together with the Office of General Counsel became increasingly concerned with the illegality of the Agency's position in handling a defector, under these conditions for such a long period of time. Strong representations were made to the Director (Mr. Helms)-by this Office, the Office of General Counsel, and the Legislative Liaison Counsel, and on 27 October 1967, the responsibility for his further handling was transferred to the Office of Security under the direction of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, then Admiral Rufus Taylor.

The Soviet defector was moved to a comfortable safehouse in the Washington area and was interviewed under friendly, sympathetic conditions by his Security Case Officer, Mr. Bruce Solie, for more than a year. It soon became apparent that the Soviet defector was bona fide and he was moved to more comfortable surroundings with considerable freedom of independent movement and has continued to cooperate fully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and this Office since that time. He has proven to be the most

valuable and economical defector this Agency has ever
had and leads which were ignored by the SR Division were
explored and have resulted in the arrest and prosecution
of Soviet recruited agents -in several
countries throughout the world. He currently is living
under an alias; secured a divorce from his Russian wife
and remarried an American citizen. He is happy, relaxed,
and appreciative of the treatment accorded him and states
"while I regret my years of incarceration, I have
no bitterness and now understand how it could happen."

I. SURVEILLANCES

A. SIESTA

During the periods 1-20 February, 12 April-7 May, and 9-20 August 1971, a surveillance was conducted of Miss Deborah Fitzgerald, a former staff employee, and Orlando Toro Nunez, a Cuban national with whom Miss Fitzgerald had become professionally and emotionally involved. Surveillance was predicated upon information that Miss Fitzgerald had been seeking from employees information in Information Processing Division files, and that employees were visiting a photographic studio operated by Miss Fitzgerald and Nunez in Fairfax City, Virginia. In addition to physical surveillance, one surreptitious entry of the photographic studio was made, and an attempt to enter the apartment of Nunez was aborted because of a door lock problem.

B. PARAGON

Pursuant to a request from the CI Staff, approved by the DCI, surveillances were conducted of Iden 69 and her associates at various times from May to September 1971. Iden 69, an acknowledged Latin American revolutionary, had long been a source of the WH Division and had given information regarding a plot to assassinate or kidnap Vice-President-Agnew and the DCI. Surveillances included coverage of the activities of Iden 69 during two visits to the United States, technical coverage of debriefings of her by WH Division representatives in New York City, and surveillance, including mail coverage, of several American citizens alleged to be part of the plot. Although most of the surveillance occurred in New York City, surveillance of one of the individuals included extensive coverage of a commune in Detroit.

C. CELOTEX T

At the direction of the DCI, a surveillance was conducted of Iden 180 of the Washington Post during

the periods 6-9 October, 27 October-10 December 1971 and on 3 January 1972. In addition to physical surveillance, an observation post was maintained in the Statler Hilton Hotel where observation could be maintained of the building housing his office. The surveillance was designed to determine Iden 180 sources of classified information of interest to the Agency which had appeared in a number of his columns.

## D. MUDHEN

At the direction of the DCI, surveillance was conducted of Jack Anderson and at various times his "leg men," Britt Hume, Leslie Whitten, and Joseph Spear, from 15 February to 12 April 1972. In addition to the physical surveillance, an observation post was maintained in the Statler Hilton Hotel directly opposite Anderson's office. The purpose of this surveillance was to attempt to determine Anderson's sources for highly classified Agency information appearing in his syndicated columns.

## E. BUTANE-

At the direction of the DCI, a surveillance was conducted on Victor L. Marchetti from 23 March to 20 April 1972. The purpose of this surveillance was to determine his activities and contacts both with Agency employees and other individuals in regard to his proposed book and published magazine articles exposing Agency operations.

## II. POLICE SUPPORT

### A.

During 1969, 1970, and 1971, on several occasions, the Intelligence Division of the Metropolitan Police Department was provided a communications system to monitor major anti-Vietnam war demonstrations in the Washington area. This system consisted of a radio receiver and an Agent at the Intelligence Division Headquarters and several automobiles from an Agency Field Office equipped with radio receivers and transmitters and manned by two Agency employees, as well as a representative of the Intelligence Division, Metropolitan Police Department. The benefit to the Agency was that the communications over this system were monitored at the Headquarters Building to provide instant notice of possible actions by the dissidents against Agency installations.

B. During the period from 1968 to 1973, several items of positive audio equipment consisting primarily of clandestine transmitters and touch-tone dial recorders were loaned to the Metropolitan Police Department, Fairfax-County, - Virginia, Police Department, Montgomery County, Maryland, Police Department, New York City Police Department, and the San Francisco, California, Police Department.

## III. GENERAL SUPPORT

A. SRPOINT-ER-

Since 1953, this office has operated a mail intercept program of incoming and outgoing Russian mail and, at various times, other selective mail at Kennedy Airport in New York City. This operation included not only the photographing of envelopes but also surreptitious opening and photographing of selected items of mail. The bulk of the take involved matters of internal security interest which was disseminated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This program is now in a dormant state pending a decision as to whether the operation will be continued or abolished.

B. AELADLE

For several years the Office of Security has provided support to a Russian defector of interest to the CI Staff. This support has consisted of numerous things, including documentation for a change of identity on three occasions.

C. REDFACE I

In July 1970, this office made a surreptitious entry of an office in Silver Spring, Maryland, occupied by a former defector working under contract for the Agency. This involved by-passing a contact and

sonic alarm system, entering a vault, and entering a safe within the vault. The purpose of the operation was to determine whether the individual had any unauthorized classified information in his possession.

D. BUREAU OF NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS

In January 1971, the Director approved a request from the Director, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, to provide covert recruitment and security clearance support to BNDD. This has been accomplished through the medium of a proprietary of the Office of Security operating in Falls Church, Virginia. Support includes covert recruitment, investigation, polygraph, medical clearance, and training. It has been divided into three phases: (1) A CI operation to place individuals in BNDD field offices to monitor any illegal activities of other BNDD employees; (2) Recruitment of Chinese or Spanish speaking covert Agents; and (3) Recruitment of an individual used as an Agent by BNDD but actually employed by BNDD, although this fact is known only to the Director and Chief Inspector, BNDD. In this case, arrangements were made for all pay and other employee benefits to come from CIA on a reimbursable basis.

E. KITTENS PROJECT

As a result of a request from the Department of State, approved by the DCI, this office has, since October 1972, provided protection on a 24-hour basis to two sons of a foreign leader who are attending school in the United States. This support includes the financing of the protection and the detail to the Department of State of six armed Agents of this office who are documented as State Department Office of Security employees.

F. MERRIMAC

From February 1967 to November 1971, an Office of Security proprietary, recruited and handled several Agents for the purpose of covertly monitoring

dissident groups in the Washington area considered to be potential threats to Agency personnel and installations. One of these Agents_so successfully penetrated one dissident group that the Agent was turned over to the FBI for handling. In addition, during this period, the Office of Security field offices were tasked with collecting available intelligence on dissident groups. All such information was included in a periodic report distributed to appropriate parts of the Agency and to certain outside Government agencies.

F. ANTLERS

Several months ago, at the request of CI Staff, and with the approval of the DDP and the DCI, this office arranged to move a sensitive defector out of a European country via commercial transportation and gain entry into the United States without leaving any trace of his true identity.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: General: Office of Security Survey

11 May 1973

1.  At the Director's instruction, and with the concurrence of the then DD/P, the Office of Security developed informants in RID to report on the activities of RID employees on whom security questions had arisen. This program, which included upwards of a dozen informants at its peak, has declined to its present level of three, only one of whom is reporting regularly on matters of current interest.

2.  The principal object of Security's interest through this informant is a female who was employed in RID for a number of years until she resigned in 1969. Her resignation coincided with the initiation of a security review on her by the Office of Security, but Security does not know whether the employee was aware of this security review at the time of her resignation.

3.  Security's interest in this employee was occasioned by reports that she had developed an increasingly intimate acquaintance with a Cuban national. Reporting by one informant, who was also being developed by the Cuban, suggested that the Cuban might have an intelligence interest in the female. The same informant also subsequently reported that the Cuban had numerous other contacts among clerical and secretarial employees of the Agency. Among these employees is one girl who works in a biographic section in SB Division.

4.  Subsequent to her departure from the Agency, the ex-RID employee entered into a common-law marital relationship with the Cuban and joined him as partner in a photographic business. In this capacity she solicited business among CIA employees, especially those requiring passport photos. Recently, she and the Cuban sought to employ Security's informant in this business on a part-time basis.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 25

5. Information on the background of the Cuban is fairly extensive, but it is inconclusive. He is known to have been a member of anti- Castro organizations this country. There are all reports that his mother was imprisoned in Cuba at one time. There are other episodes in his life that suggest intelligence involvement on his part with some hostile service, but this is not yet definitely established.

6. The Office of Security has had at times a second informant in this case. His reporting has tended to confirm reporting by the principal informant.

7. There is conclusive evidence that the Cuban expressed interest in certain 201 files in the Agency, and there are good grounds for believing that the RID female employee delivered at least one such file to the Cuban while she was still in RID. There is also evidence that the female employee in SB Division has continued in frequent contact with her friend, the ex-RID employee, and the Cuban. On one occasion, she served as intermediary for contact instructions from the Cuban to O/S's principal informant. The informant has no knowledge, however, of any other requirements that may have been levied on or satisfied by the SB employee. Neither does he know of the extent of contacts by this couple with other Agency employees except social contacts.

8. The Office of Security has been running this operation for over two years, in an effort to obtain conclusive proof of its intelligence nature. CI Staff has been kept informed. The FBI, which was informed of the case at an early stage, has declined to take responsibility for it, on grounds that it concerns CLA's internal security. As a result, the Office ofSecurity has been inhibited in the actions it can take against the Cuban suspect. On the other hand, Security has not taken any action against Agency employees for fear of compromising the operation.

9. It would appear to me that the Office of Security has dallied with this case long enough. Apparently unable through positive measures to resolve doubts about the case, O/S has followed the course of watchful waiting, hoping the Cuban would take precipitant action himself that would give us the evidence we seek. In the meantime, our knowledge of the relationship between the Cuban and the several other current Agency employees with whom he is known to have contact continues


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 26

• to be quite limited. Neither the Cuban nor his girlfriend have made any further approaches to Security's informant recently, although he continues to see them ocially. Thus, there is slineason to believe that further waiting will produce a break in the case.

10. There are two courses open to the Office of Security now. It can attempt to have the Agency employees known to be in contact with the Cuban transferred to nonsensitive positions. This might alert the Cuban to our penetration of the operation, particularly since a plausible reason for transfer would be difficult to develop for some of the persons involved. Alternatively, Security could move overtly and charge the Agency employees with violation of the security regulation requiring reporting of contacts with foreign nationals. This would, of course, terminate the Office of Security's operation.

11. One of these courses of action should be chosen promptly. The possibility that the employee in SB Division may be passing information on CLA's Soviet operations is too great to warrant further delay in moving against her. Moreover, it is possible that the Cuban has current productive penetrations of RID. Thus, the risk of damage to the Agency seems clearly to outweigh any.possible gains from continuing this CI effort.

9 May 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management & Services

SUBJECT: Press Allegations re Use of Agency Polygraph

1. This memorandum is for your information only and confirms a report I made to you by telephone earlier today.

2. On 22 July 1971, an article was carried on American proposals relative to the SALT talks in The New York Times over the by-line of Iden 181. It was devastatingly accurate and contained direct quotes from a Presidential advisory memorandum the White House had sent to Mr. Gerard Smith, Director, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, a few days earlier. The President was alleged to be furious with this unauthorized disclosure of classified information and directed a sweeping investigation within the United States Government to determine the source of the disclosure. Investigation was conducted under the direction of Mr. Egil Krogh and Mr. David Young, Staff Assistants to Mr. John Ehrlichman, Counsel to the President for Domestic Affairs.

3. On the basis of investigations conducted by State Security and Defense officials, four individuals--one individual in the Department of Defense and three individuals in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency--were tabbed as leading suspects. Mr. Egil Krogh contacted me on 26 July 1971 and requested that we arrange to polygraph the three suspects in the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and volunteered the information that the Federal Bureau of Investigation would be asked to polygraph the one suspect in the Department of Defense.

ADMINISTRATIVE-INTERNAL USE ONLY

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

4. I informed Mr. Krogh that from time to time in matters involving the national security the Agency had detailed to Mr. G. Marvin Gentile, Director of State Security, a polygraph operator and a polygraph machine for his use in polygraphing State Department employees who were recipients of allegations concerning their loyalty. I emphasized that this procedure had the Director's approval and that State clearly understood that the examin- ation was their total responsibility. I further informed him that this was the only way we could undertake to enter- tain his request and that even then it would require the specific approval of the Director. Mr. Krogh asked me to obtain such approval and work out such arrangements with Mr. Gentile.

5. Later that same day, Mr. Krogh called Mr. Gentile and inquired as to whether the arrangements had been made. Mr. Gentile indicated they had and suggested that the same polygraph operator be used to examine the Defense suspect. Mr. Krogh informed Mr. Gentile that he considered this an excellent idea and that he would instruct Defense officials to make their man available to Mr. Gentile for a polygraph examination.

6. The four individuals were Iden 182 of the Department of Defense and Iden 183, Iden 184, and Iden 185 of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The polygraph examinations resulted in clearing the four men and the results of the examinations were forwarded over my signature to Mr. Gentile on 29 July 1971. A copy of my covering memorandum is attached.

7. Iden 186, a staff writer for The Washington Post, in an article dated 3 September 1971, stated that a State Department spokesman had acknowledged at a news briefing that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had polygraphed State Department employees suspected of leaking information on the SALT talks in July. Mr. John Edgar Hoover, then Director of the Federal


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 29

ADMINISTRATIVE-INTERNAL USE ONLY

Bureau of Investigation, denied this allegation in a letter to The Washington Post and said that the polygraph examinations had been conducted by another agency. Speculation centered around the Agency, but after a day or so, press speculation in this regard died away.

8. Iden 186 apparently has never been satisfied and has been pressing Mr. Charles Bray, State Department spokesman, for confirmation of Agency involvement. Mr. Bray learned today that Iden 186 plans to use a press conference to be held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon to press this point further. Mr. Bray has been given guidance by Mr. Gentile to avoid confirmation but if this is impossible he will indicate the examinations were conducted by State Department Security officials utilizing an operator and a machine detailed to the Department for this purpose. I do not know whether or not the fact that the government-wide investigation was directed by Mr. Egil Krogh is known to Iden 186 but I suspect that it is and that this is the reason why the matter has been raised again. Mr. David Young was instrumental in pushing my office to conduct an internal Agency investigation of this disclosure and the White House was satisfied that no Agency employee was the source.

SUBJECT: Items in John Clarke Memorandum to the Director of Central Intelligence, dated 9 May 1973

1. Two items in the attached memorandum had not previously been reported. The first: "-- Use of CIA funds and facilities to acquire U.S. real estate for FBI and provision of technical equipments by NSA (MHDOZEN) for use against a common target in the U.S."

2. In a follow-up meeting with Mr. Clarke, he advised that involved here was the use of funds appropriatedfor CIA being given to the FBI in cashiers checks for the purpose of buying an apartment building.

There was also Agency help given in handling the purchase. Further, other CIA monies in cashiers checks were given to NSA who, with some OTS assistance, was working on new gadgetry for the surveillance. Mr. Clarke said he thought the only problem here was in the use of funds, not in the operation. He thought the only source of additional information on this subject was Mr. Ray Rocca of the DDO/CI Staff.

3. The second item: "-- Use of CIA funds to help State Department defer Presidential representational expenses of President Lyndon B. Johnson's trip to Southeast Asia."

4. Mr. Clarke said the total amount of money requested by State Department was $3,000,000 but that the Director would not agree to this amount. The Director did supply funds in those instances where some operational activity was involved or could be inferred, i.e., crowd control, politicalaction influence activity, etc. Mr. Clarke was not sure of the amount of Agency

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management and Services

SUBJECT: Special Report

1.  This memorandum is in response to a request to provide information on situations or associations that might appear to be irregular on the surface.

2.  Details to the White House and Government Agencies -
    Background: For many years the Central Intelligence Agency has detailed employees to the immediate office of the White House per se and to components associated intimately with the immediate office of the President such as the Council on International Economic Policy and the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. We have furnished secretaries, clerical employees and certain professional employees on a reimbursable and non-reimbursable basis. At the present time, he, we have no clericals or professionals assigned to the immediate White House office, but we do have one young man detailed to their Communications Section. There are detailees to PFIAB and CIEP. I might point out that we had detailed to the White House as late as the fall of 1970 couriers, telephone operators, a laborer assigned to the grounds and a graphics man who designed invitations for State dinners. By October of 1970, more funds were apparently available to run the White House and most of our detailees were hired as bona fide White House employees. CIA is not the only Agency furnishing the White House with detailees. Levies have been made by this Administration and others on Defense and State and other Government entities whose employees have Top Secret clearances.

Professional officers have been and are at the present time assigned to the National Security Council and we have seven clericals on detail to NSC on a reimbursable basis.

In addition to the above, we have technical specialists detailed to NSA, an instructor at the National War College and security officers detailed to the Department of State to

CONFIDENTIAL E 2 IMPDET C1 By 003935

00105

NW 88296 Docld:32989624 Page 36


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

protect foreign visitors. Recently, John Hay was detailed to the Secretary of the Treasury along with ur other Agency employees. We have even, in rare. instances, detailed our people to Congressional Staffs for short periods of time.

3. Details to the White House and Government Agencies
   Discussion: Details to NSC, the White House, NSA and the National War College are probably quite defensible. On the other hand, there may be those who would question Agency employees currently working at the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs and Mr. Peter Peterson having an Agency employee as his secretary when he was the Secretary of Commerce (she also made a trip with him to Moscow). She is still with him in his present assignment but we expect that she will report to NSC for a new detail sometime this month. Iden 112 served for over ten years as Director of the Office of. Public Safety for AID. This information has been kept "close to the vest" during that entire period of time. He has been approved for disability retirement and is presently on sick leave and will retire automatically at the expiration of this leave.

Each detail of an Agency employee to the White House or other Government agency has been carefully considered and approval at a higher level obtained when professionals were involved.

4. Project TWOFOLD: I believe the support we are providing to Project MOFOLD is an activity that should be. reported under your guidelines. Since this is an extremely sensitive Project and the Office of Security is reporting on it, I will not repeat the details in my memorandum.

5. Individuals Engaged in Domestic Activities: In a more general sense, Contract Personnel Division prepares and executes contracts with individuals engaged by the Agency to carry out domestic activities. We also process Staff Agents who are domestically assigned. None of these assignments are decided in OP. I really have no way of knowing with any degree of certainty what the specific duties of these individuals will be.

6. Arrangements with American Firms: In the interest of reporting "too much," I would remind you that Contract Personnel Division writes "agreements" with domestically based American firms to provide cover for Agency assets. The actual assignments are overseas. The arrangements, however, are backstopped, in the main, in the United States.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 38

# 7. Contractual Relationship - USJPRS:

The Agency organization, USJPRS, has a contractual association with approximately 1,500 independent contractors and 45 contract employees. These individuals are unwitting of the fact that they really work for CIA in the performance of their domestic activities. USJPRS (United States Joint Publications Research Service) is a part of FBIS. They perform a translation service of unclassified documents for the Government. The independent contractors work in their own homes and are given assignments as the need arises. The contract employees are "integrated" into the Bureau of Standards and are located in Washington, D. C. They are paid and administered by the Bureau. CIA reimburses the Bureau. Their basic contracts of employment are prepared in Contract Personnel Division.

# 8. Hunt Requests a Lockpicker:

This is a record of External Employment Assistance Branch's action on a request from Howard Hunt for a lockpicker who might be retiring or resigning from the Agency.

Sometime in the spring of 1972, Iden 38 of EEAB received a call from Howard Hunt who asked Iden 38 if he had a retiree or resignee who was accomplished at picking locks. Iden 38 sent him a resume on Thomas Amato who retired 31 July 1971. Iden 38 did not document his EEAB record to show the date of this exchange, but Mr. Thomas-Hester (who also works in EEAB) opines that it occurred sometime between March and May 1972.

All of the above information was reported to the Office of Security on 4 October 1972 following the FBI's contact with the Agency regarding Howard Hunt.

# 9. Resume Sent to McCord:

Ross Lambert, a contract employee who retired in September 1971, was a client of the External Employment Assistance Branch in his search for a job after retirement. One of the leads given to Lambert was James McCord's security business. EEAB sent a resume to McCord, but Lambert was not hired.

In mid-summer 1972, Mr. Lambert telephoned EEAB from Chicago. (He had a job there with the Halifax Security Co., a lead provided by EEAB, but until this telephone call he had


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 39

not notified EEAB that he had the job and had moved from the D.C. area.) Heaid he had been visited a Special
Agent of the FBI who told Lambert that his resume had been
found among McCord's papers. The. Agent wanted to know if
Lambert had any connection with McCord. Lambert explained
how the resume got to McCord. After the Agent left him,
Lambert telephoned EEAB. Mr. Kennedy of OP and Iden 29
OS were notified immediately.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

THROUGH : Deputy Director for Management and Services

SUBJECT : Sensitive Activities Performed by the Office of Logistics

1. This memorandum contains *information* for the Director of Central Intelligence.

2. This memorandum is submitted pursuant to advice given by the Deputy Director for Management and Services on 7 May that Office Directors report on activities, either under their cognizance or otherwise known to them, the nature of which could possibly need explanation or justification when viewed within the statutory responsibility and authority of the Director of Central Intelligence. The responsibilities of the Office of Logistics (OL) are such that in all matters herein reported, except two, the actions undertaken were at the request of another Agency component. We have prepared a brief description of each action involved and then have included the name of the sponsoring component. The substantive reason for the requests for action by this Office will have to be determined by inquiry to the designated sponsoring component.

3. Facts pertaining to both actions undertaken at the initiative of this Office are as follows:

a. A covert procurement proprietary concern, dedicated to the acquisition of firearms, ammunition, and related police-type equipment, is operated in Baltimore, Maryland. It was organized in 1969. This proprietary is operated in order to give the Agency a capability to obtain such materiel without associating the procurement action with the United States Government. It is legally necessary that the proprietary be licensed by both the State and Federal jurisdictions. Since it is located in Maryland, it is appropriately licensed by the Maryland State Police to buy and sell firearms and ammunition.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 41

# SUBJECT: Sensitive ctivities Performed by th. Office of Logistics

The Maryland State Police have been briefed on the Agency's association with this proprietary and have assisted us in obtaining the appropriate State license. Similarly, a Federal license has been obtained for the proprietary through an arrangement with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms of the Department of the Treasury. They, too, have been briefed on the Agency's association with this proprietary.

b. Under Title 18, Chapter 2512 of the U. S. Code (1968), the sale of electronic intelligence equipment is prohibited except to Federal agencies, and state and local law enforcement agencies. In essence, this law makes it almost impossible to procure electronic intelligence equipment in a covert manner so that no tie or relationship to the United States Government is made. In order for the Agency to covertly obtain such equipment and hide any Government interest, the Covert Procurement Staff of the Procurement Division. has relied on an established working relationship with a U.S. firm. This firm, a prominent supplier located in Maryland, deals in a wide range of law enforcement, police supplies, and equipment. The Covert Procurement Staff has, had a relationship withan officer in the firm for over 15 years. The officer agreed to allow us to place orders through his corporation to major suppliers of this equipment with a billing to an Agency national proprietary.There is an understanding that. if any inquiry is raised by the Department of Justice, the firm's officer would immediately call the Chief of the Covert Procurement Staff who would, through appropriate liaison channels, contact the Department of Justice, identify the Agency's interest in the procurement action, and clear the officer of any responsibility. On 10 September 1971, there was an inquiry about the proprietary fron an FBI agent making a routinė investigation of the officer's books. Through Office of Security liaison with the Department of Justice and the FBI, the agent was informed that it is an Agency notional proprietary. This disclosure closed the inquiry and, since that time, there has been no further inquiry. Most of the DD/O area divisions from time to time submit requisitions to us to acquire surveillance equipment. The majority of the transactions are on behalf of the intelligence service with whom liaison is conducted in various foreign countries. By agreement between this Office and

the DD/O, we will not honor any requisition for surveil- lance equipment unless it has been approved by the CI Staff of the DD/O.

4. Within the area of contractual responsibilities, the following items are pertinent:

a. In February 1971, Colonel L. K. White, the then Executive Director-Comptroller, called me to attend a meeting in his office, also attended by Mr. William Colby. Colonel White explained that the Technical Services Division (TSD) had been requested to provide assistance to the FBI for a sensitive project

Colonel White did not disclose the purpose of the assistance being provided by TSD but did instruct me to assist TSD on purely contractual matters. Since the Office of Logistics has no information concerning the mission or purpose of Project sub- stantive questions concerning the subject should be addressed to TSD. Other procurement actions accomplished for the FBI are reported below. Specific mention is made, however, of the Project because of the dollar magnitude, approximately $1 million, and the complex technical equipment that has been involved in the undertaking.

b. The Procurement Division, OL, currently has two requisitions in hand from TSD which would involve reimbursable sales to the FBI. One such requisition in the amount of $36,900 is for two Kestinghouse television cameras. The second requisition in the amount of $11,200 is for two wide-angle surveillance probes manufactured by Bausch and Lomb. No action is being taken on either of these requirements pending further instructions which will be sought from the Deputy Director for Management and Services.

c. Over the years, this Agency has often supported other Government agencies from a contractual or materiel standpoint. Upon the submission of an officially approved request, supported by a transfer of funds, the Agency would either enter into "accommodation procurements" for the requesting agency or support the requesting agency by the issuance of materiel from stock. Such actions are legally accomplished under the Economy Act of 1925. This Act authorizes one agency to support the needs of, or provide a service for, another Government agency when such

action would be more economical and eliminate the need for one agency of the Government to duplicate facilities readily available from another. A typical example of this procedure is purchasing photointerpretation gear for the Defense Intelligence Agency element located at NPIC. In connection with the current reporting requirement, however, I have had our records researched for the past 2 years and Attachment 1 reflects those transactions which appear to be relevant to the subject of this memorandum.

d. In connection with the disclosures during the summer of 1971 that the Rand Corporation was not properly safeguarding classified documents, this Office undertook two acts. I directed the Security Officer from our: West Coast Procurement Office at the Iden 87

to visit the Rand Corporation and satisfy himself that classified material furnished them by the Agency was both properly safeguarded and accounted for. His report was affirmative. On 23 August 1971, the senior Security Officer assigned to this Office forwarded a letter to the Rand Corporation stressing and reaffirming the procedures Rand must follow in safeguarding classified information furnished them by the Agency. Of residual interest in this matter, there is summarized the contents of a memorandum of 2 July 1971 to the Executive Director- Comptroller from the DD/I which is in our possession.

This memorandum reports that FBIS regularly disseminated reports to the Rand Corporation but that instructions had been issued to cease distribution of classified reports. While no other direct dissemination went to Rand, other USIB agencies, primarily USAF, were passing "many" copies of DD/I products to Rand as au- thorized under USIB regulations. The memorandum also states that Rand personnel had requested searches and document retrieval from the CRS facility.

5. In connection with action taken for the Office of Security, there are three relevant items:

a. The Printing Services Division, OL, was requested by the Office of Security to print a book written by Harry J. Murphy, Office of Security. The book was prepared by Mr. Murphy under a Brookings Institution Federal

NW.88296.Docld:32989624 Page 43

![EYES ONLY SECRET]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

SUBJECT: Sensitive Activities Performed by the Office of Logistics

Executive Fellowship.-- The book is entitled "Where's What -- Sources of Information for Federal Investigators." It is a full treatise on the existence of sources of information that may be useful to an investigator. The book's first printing of 300 copies was made in June 1967. Due to demand, a second printing of 600 copies was made in September 1968. The title page of the book gives attribution to Office of Security, Central Intelligence Agency, and the Brookings Institution Federal Executive Fellowship. The book is classified Confidential, and it is our understanding that the distribution was made to appropriate agencies of the Federal Government. A copy of Mr. Murphy's book can be made available for review if desired.

Sometime in 1972, a representative of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) requested that the Agency give consideration to our publishing, at LEAA expense, an unclassified version of this volume. It was the intent of LEAA to make broad-scale distribution to Police Departments throughout the country. The Director of Security and I consulted on this matter and jointly determined that the LEAA request should not be honored because the Agency should not put itself in the position of publishing law enforcement material for general and unclassified purposes, and it would be an abuse of our printing facilities.

b. On 5 January 1971, the Director of Security requested that I approve his leasing up to eleven motor vehicles for use in connection with a special support operation which would last approximately 3 months. The Director of Security informed me, in his requesting memorandum of 5 January 1971, that "This support activity has been undertaken at the specific instruction of the Director and has his personal approval." The request was approved.

c. From 1968 to date, the Office of Security has requisitioned from this Office a considerable amount of materiel which we understand was to be given or loaned by them to local Police Departments. In certain cases some of this materiel was issued from Agency stocks and, in other cases, direct procurement of the materiel was made by funds furnished by the Office of Security. A complete listing of such materiel is found in Attachment 2.

6. In connection with the responsibility held by this Office to obtain, manage, and dispose of safe sites for all Agency operating components, the following information is relevant.

a. A safe site, identified as "Safehouse 562" which is Iden 88 was made available to General Cushman's office on 23 July 1971.

The subject safe site was acquired on 15 June 1970 as a replacement for a terminated OL standby safe site and in keeping with the approved requirement for a complement of five standby safehouses for all Agency use. The apartment has one bedroom and is located in an older high-rise building along Iden 89. The nominal lessee is Iden 90 a security-cleared attorney with offices located at Iden 91. The cover story utilized is that Iden 90, rents the apartment for business conferences, meetings, and occasional overnight stays by his staff and/or his out-of-town clients. The original lease term was for a 1-year period, 15 June 1970 to 14 June 1971, with month-to-month renewals thereafter. As an OL standby safe site, the apartment has been used by various Agency components to meet their short-term or crash requirements. Control of the standby safe site and its security is the responsibility of this Office. A record is maintained of each user, component, and date of use; however, no record is made of those persons being met at the site nor for what purpose the site is being used (meetings, training, etc.). Such information is maintained by the operating component requesting the safe site. Records maintained by this Office disclose only that the apartment involved was made available to General Cushman's office on 23 July 1971 in answer to a telephonic request.

b. This Office is aware, although it had no cognizance nor responsibility, that an apartment was rented in Miami Beach, Florida, during the period of the Democratic National Convention, 10-14 July 1972, and the Republican National Convention, 21-24 August 1972. The apartment was used as a meeting place for officers of the Miami Station who were in liaison with members of the Secret Service and rendering

assistance in connection with the political conventions that were being held. WH Division is the cognizant operating component on this matter.

7. The above recitation of facts represents, to the best of my knowledge and memory, those matters which appear to be relevant to subject tasking given by the Director.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Summary, Special Programs Division (SPD),
Office of Communications, Operational
Contacts with Other U.S. Government Agencies

1. Prior to 1969 the OC COMINT intercept unit, which was then in Miami, had relatively frequent contact with the Miami bureaus of the FBI and FCC, Miami Police and the Miami Beach Police. The staff provided support to these activities in monitoring, identification and DF of specific illegal agent transmissions conducted by foreign nationals and American citizens in the greater Miami area. Arrangements for this support were made through the DDO's Chief, WH, Miami.

2. In late September 1972, NSA, through Division D/ DDO, requested that the Special Programs Division initiate a hearability survey of certain HF long-distance commercial telephone circuits between the U.S. and South America. The circuits carried drug related long-distance calls of interest to the BNDD and other U.S. agencies. Because of the availability of personnel and technical capabilities, the survey was conducted at the OC Relay Station at Iden 92 Virginia, where the circuits could be satisfactorily inter- cepted. On 15 January 1973, formal NSA tasking of the intercept was instituted. On 30 January 1973, all coverage was terminated by Division D because of possible legal complications.

3. The Chief and Deputy Chief, SPD and SPD/Special Electronic Operations Branch have been engaged in informal technical liaison with operating components of the FBI for a number of years. Initial contacts and arrangements for support of specific activities have been made by the Division D/DDO. Support has been provided in the form of

In the past several years, support has been rendered to sensitive FBI projects MOHAWK, UNION and WUGRAVEL. Support has been and is presently being given to FBI projects ORKID and ROSE. These projects are described in the attached sealed envelope.

4. An operational test of an NSA-developed HF/DF system was jointly conducted by NSA, Division D/DDO and OC-SPD personnel in the early part of the summer of 1972. A location in Miami Beach, Florida was selected for the tests because of similarity to the actual target site and environment in Saigon. Receiving antennas were placed on the roof of the hotel being used as the receiving/DF site. A hotel employee asked why the materiel was placed on the roof. A team member in effect told him that the group was an advance security segment for the Democratic National Convention. No further questions were asked; the tests were completed and the equipment was returned to the Washington area.

SUBJECT: Mr. Colby's Request to Inspector General to Determine Subject Referred to by Two Notes in a PP/B Memo to DD/M&S

REFERENCE: D/PPB Memo to DD/M&S dated 23 May 1973, Subject: Watergate Principals - Direct or Indirect Involvement

1. The two notes of 13 and 20 January 1972 refer to approval by the DCI (at that time Mr. Helms) for the expenditure of $30-32K for a sensitive CS project. No further details were given, Mr. Colby asked that DDO records be checked.

2. DDO records show that the funds went to the CI Staff for a project called Iden 99. This is a joint operation with the Iden 100 service for the collection of ELINT intelligence. The activity is handled by the Special Intelligence Group of the CI Staff.

3. The funds cited in the notes was transferred to CI on 13 January 1972. It is believed by DDO/MPS and the CI Staff that the two notes refer to the same appropriated amount,ie., $30 to 32K and not to two separate allocations.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management and Services

SUBJECT: Watergate Principals - Direct or Indirect Involvement

1. This memorandum responds to the Director's request for a report of any involvement in any capacity since 1 January 1969 with Messrs. Hunt, McCord, Liddy, Young, or Krogh.

2. I have had none with Hunt, Liddy or Young.

3. My McCord contact was indirect and occurred sometime during the late 1960's when I was Director, Office of Computer Services. I opposed plans for Technical Division, Office of Security (under Mr. McCord) to acquire a separate computer for Iden 101.
   Ted Hines of DD/S&T (then ORD) was the computer individual working with TD and, I think, would have details.

4. The Krogh contact also was indirect and involved his request, first through OMB, that CIA fund foreign travel on behalf of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control. Individual phone discussions are noted in the attached. The Agency focal points were Iden 32 and Iden 3; I understand Iden 3 has forwarded relevant documentation. Copies of memoranda from Messrs. Krogh, Iden 3 and Colby are attached also.

5. I held a staff meeting yesterday to pass the request to all OPPB employees. One officer who was attending a funeral will not be available until tomorrow.

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

19 Jul 972

SUBJECT: Conversation with Jack Bauman

1. While on leave visiting Disney World in Florida, I dropped in to see Jack Bauman who lives in Winterhaven, Florida. Jack retired from the Agency about five years ago on disability due to a serious heart condition. He was with the Office of Security for about 20 years prior to his retirement.

2. During a private conversation Jack told me that he had been interviewed three or four times by the FBI in connection with the McCord-Hunt affair. I asked him why he had been interviewed, and he told me that in late 1971 he had been contacted by Howard Hunt who suggested that he consider an assignment as Security Officer for the Republican Party. Jack visited Washington in January 1972 to discuss the proposed position with Howard Hunt who apparently was acting on behalf of the Republican Party. Jack furnished a resume to Hunt and discussed the position with him. Ultimately, he decided not to accept the position because he felt that his heart condition would not allow him to become involved in such activity.

3. According to Jack, during the meeting with Mr. Hunt they discussed some of the requirements of the job. At that time they discussed a need for both a positive and a counteraudio program and a need for a good security system both before and during the National Convention. Jack indicated that he sincerely believed that the Republican Party did need a security officer and a good security programmer but felt that he could not afford to accept the job even. though it was a very lucrative offer. Apparently, money was not a problem.

4. When Jack declined, he indicated the Mr. Hunt asked
   for any other recomendations he might have. According to Jack
   he told Mr. Hunt that most of the people he knew were still in the
   Agency, but he did furnish the name of! IDEN-108 who might be
   possibly ready to retire from the Agency.

5. Jack informed me that he assumed that the Bureau
   obtained his name due to the resume he furnished Mr. Hunt. He
   said that the Bureau had talked to him on three or four occasions
   and that he had written up about a 40 page statement concerning
   his dealings with Mr. Hunt. When asked about Mr. McCord, Jack
   said that he really did not know McCord that well and declined any
   knowledge of Mr. McCord's technical capability.

6. Mr. Bauman indicated that he had not been in touch
   with Mr. Hunt since the early part of 1972 and knew nothing of
   the Watergate operation. He stated that he had gained the impres-
   sion from the Bureau interview that the technical devices were being
   removed at the time of the arrest and were not being installed as
   originally reported.

7. All of the above information was volunteered by Mr.
   Bauman, and I really did not get involved in any discussion on the
   matter other than to comment that I hated to see the Agency's name
   connected with such an incident in any way. The above conversation
   took place during a 10 or 15 minute period and no other discussion
   relating to this incident was held. It is being reported for the record
   and for information of the Director of Security.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Management and Services

SUBJECT: Contacts with Individuals Named in the Watergate Matter

1. I am addressing this to you instead of to the Director of Central Intelligence since I doubt that the information contained herein is of such significance to warrant his interest and because it has been on record with the Agency since July 1972. However, if you feel that the information is of such interest that it should be forwarded to the Director I shall put it in the proper format to do so.

2. My only contact with anyone named in connection with the Watergate and related matters was through Mr. Jack Bauman a former Agency employee now retired and living in Winterhaven, Florida. In December 1971 Mr. Bauman called me from Florida and advised that he wanted to get in touch with Howard Hunt. He said that he did not have Hunt's home phone number and that it was probably unlisted but that since Hunt was a former employee, could I contact Hunt and ask him to give Mr. Bauman a call. I had only met Hunt once about 10 years before but I agreed to relay the message. I called Howard Hunt at his home and told him that Mr. Bauman did not have his home phone and requested he call Mr. Bauman. Mr. Hunt thanked me for relaying the message and said that he would call Mr. Bauman. This seemed of little consequence to me in December 1971 but in July 1972 Iden 17 of the Office of Security contacted me in regard to the FBI investigation of the Watergate situation. At that time I informed Iden 17 of the telephone call from Mr. Bauman in December 1971. Attached is a copy of a Memorandum for the Record prepared by Iden 17 as a result of our conversation.

3. In the summer of 1972 I took my family to Disney World in Florida and took that occasion to drop in to see Jack Bauman. Mr. Bauman told me in a private conversation that he had been interviewed three or four times by the FBI in connection with the Watergate affair and he related to me his contact

with Howard Hunt. On 19 July 1972 after my return from Florida I reported this conversation to the Director of Security and made it a Memorandum for the Record. This memorandum was sent to Mr. Colby and a copy of the memorandum is attached.

4. Other than knowing Mr. McCord through his employment with the Agency and meeting Howard Hunt once in about 1959, I do not know nor have I had any contact with any individuals named or knowledge of related matters now receiving attention in the press.

Iden 108

1. Last week Special Agent Arnold Parham of the FBI con-tacted the Acting DD/OS. He asked whether or not the Subjects worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. Previously, requests of this nature were followed up by the FBI with an interview of the subjects.

2. I briefed Mr. Colby who is the Agency's focal point on the "Watergate" case and the Acting DD/S of the FBI inquiry. Mr. Colby suggested that we determine the extent of involvement and indicated that we advise the Bureau of their employment.

3. When Agent Parham was again contacted and advised of the Subjects' employment with the Agency, he indicated that the Bureau does not wish to interview them.

4. The office of the DD/PS will interview Iden 108 the same fashion as Mr. True was previously interviewed.

5. I called Mr. Kane both at his office and his residence 'and learned that he is in Florida and will return to duty on 17 July. I called Mr. Kane this morning to advise him of the inquiry.

6. Mr. Kane stated that he has no firm conclusion as to how the Bureau obtained his name. He stated that he has seen Mr. Hunt on only one occasion in 1959. At that time Hunt was the Chief of Station, Montevideo. The meeting was occasioned

by the fact that Mr Kane accompanied a technic sweep team to the Montevideo station. Mr. Kane stated further that around Christmas time of 1971 he received a call from Jack Bauman who wanted to get in touch with Mr. Hunt. Mr. Bauman asked Mr. Kane how he could get in touch with him. Mr. Kane obtained Mr. Hunt's telephone number through telephone information channels whereupon he passed the number on to Mr. Bauman.

7. Mr. Kane stated that he has information that Jack Bauman has talked to the FBI on several occasions in connection with the current investigation and that he surmises that the Bureau may have obtained his name from him.

1. On 16 October 1972 Messrs. Freckinridge and Heintzelman,
   in the course of a Survey, were briefed on activities of the
   Atlantic/Pacific Division of the Office of Economic reports. One
   project cited was a query from the Director, apparently at the re-
   quest of Secretary Shultz, to the effect, "What do we know about
   Vesco," the man then running IOS. Two of OCR's analysts were assigned
   to the project and, working through the Domestic Contact service,
   spent a day going over the files of the Securities and Exchange
   Commission. There apparently was some contact also with EUR Division
   of the Deputy Directorate for Plans and with the Office of Current
   Intelligence.

2. The information above is based on rough notes and obviously
   is sketchy. It is cited now not to suggest any wrongdoing but because
   of the current publicity about Vesco and the probability of continuing
   probes into the subject by the press and the courts.

FROM : Deputy Director for Intelligence

SUBJECT : Activities Possibly Outside CIA's Legislative Charter

1. This memorandum responds to your instruction to report any activities which might be considered outside CIA'S legislative charter.

2. All Office and Staff chiefs in the Intelligence Directorate have reviewed the past and present activities of their components. I have received responses from all of them, and none reported any activities related to either the Watergate affair or the break into the offices of Ellsberg's psychiatrist. Although contacts with three of the people allegedly implicated in these incidents were reported, these contacts were on matters other than the two improper activities:

Hunt: Col. White, Richard Lehman, and I talked to Hunt in late 1970 regarding his preparation of a recommendation in support of the Agency's nomination of R. Jack Smith for the National Civil Service League Award.

Mitchell: While Mr. Mitchell was Attorney General, an OCI officer was assigned the task of providing him with daily briefings on foreign developments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 70

- Young:
  Harry Eisenbeiss and Clarus Rice of CRS had frequent contacts with Young during the summer of 1972 in connection with Executive Order 11652 and the implementing NSC directive. This involved visits by Young to CIA to discuss information storage and retrieval and several meetings of an inter-agency group dealing with the implementation of the Executive Order and directive.

3. In accordance with my instructions, several Offices reported domestic activities which might appear questionable to outsiders. Their responses are attached. Most of these activities are clearly within the Agency's charter, but there are a few which could be viewed as borderline.

- DCS collects information on foreign students studying in the US.

- DCS collects information on physicians practicing in the US who have studied abroad (mostly foreign nationals).

- DCS accepts information on possible foreign involvement in US dissident groups and on the narcotics trade when sources refuse to deal with the FBI and ENDD directly.

- DCS assesses the suitability and willingness of US citizens to cooperate with CIA.

- DCS, for six months in late 1972 and early 1973, was acquiring telephone routing slips on overseas calls.

- Information deleted because it reveals sensitive operational techniques and methods.

- NPIC and COMIREX review satellite imagery from NASA programs to identify photography too "sensitive" for public release.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 71

- NPIC has examined domestic coverage for special purposes such as natural catastrophies and civil disturbances.

- OCI, in 1967 and 1968, prepared intelligence memoranda on possible foreign connections with the US anti-war movement and world-wide student dissidence (including the SDS) at the request of the White House.

- CRS is regularly involved with Customs in examining the contents of motion picture film cans addressed to the Soviet, and occasionally other foreign, embassies to acquire positive foreign intelligence.

- FBIS has on occasion supplied linguists to work directly for another agency, e.g., to the FBI to translate Arabic in Washington.

- FBIS monitors radio press dispatches and reports covered by copyright. These are circulated within the Government and stamped "Official Use Only". This has gone on for three decades without problems.

- FBIS has monitored and reported on foreign radio broadcasts of statements and speeches of US citizens such as those by US POWs in Hanoi, Jane Fonda, and Ramsey Clarke.

- FBIS has run the Joint Publication Research Service under Department of Commerce cover since 1957. JPRS is a facility for obtaining translations of unclassified publications in foreign languages and contracts with private individuals to do this work. Most of these individuals are not witting of the CIA-JPRS relationship.

SUBJECT : Activity Related to Domestic Events

1. OCI began following Caribbean black radicalism in earnest in 1968. The emphasis of our analysis was on black nationalism as a political force in the Caribbean and as a threat to the security of the Caribbean states. Two DDI memoranda were produced on the subject: "Black Radicalism in the Caribbean" (6 August 1969), and "Black Radicalism in the Caribbean--Another Look" (12 June 1970). In each a single paragraph was devoted to ties with the US black power movement; the discussion primarily concerned visits of Stokely Carmichael and other US black power activists to the Caribbean and other overt contacts.

2. In June 1970, Archer Bush of OCI was asked to write a memorandum with special attention to links between black radicalism in the Caribbean and advocates of black power in the US. The record is not clear where this request originated, but it came through channels from the DCI. The paper was to be treated as especially sensitive and was to include material provided by the Special Operations group of the CI Staff. The CI Staff material was voluminous but did not provide meaningful evidence of important links between militant blacks in the US and the Caribbean. This, in fact, was one of the conclusions of the paper. The memorandum was produced in typescript form and given to the DCI.

SUBJECT: DCS Domestic Activity

To the best of my knowledge, DCS has not engaged in any activity outside the CIA charter or that could be construed as illegal. Some of the functions that we perform under HR 1-13f (i) of providing operational support within the US to all elements of CIA and to the USIB-member agencies, however, are perhaps borderline or could be construed as illegal if mis- interpreted. For example:

1.  Provide personality and assessment data on certain foreign students and visiting foreign scientists and officials.

2.  Identify foreign students in the US through collection of foreign student lists from certain universities.

3.  Provide personality and assessment data on US citizens to determine their suitability and willingness to cooperate with the Agency.

4.  Introduce cooperative US businessmen and academicians to Agency personnel who are in alias but using CIA credentials.

5.  Collect information on possible foreign involvement or penetration of US dissident groups, but only in a passive manner and only when the source has refused to pass the information directly to the FBI.

6.  Collect information on the narcotics trade, but again only in a passive manner when the source has refused to pass the information directly to BNDD or the FBI.

SUBJECT: DCS Domestic Activity

7. Collect specific information and supply duplicate or master keys for foreign hotels.

8. Collect medical information from cooperative contacts on foreign leaders who have received medical treatment or examinations in the US.

9. Obtain computer tape records of physicians practicing in the US who have studied abroad. Although most were foreign nationals, some were US. The taped information included school, present business address, date of birth, and specialty.

10. Acquire routing slips recording the fact of overseas telephone calls between persons in the US and persons overseas and telephone calls between two foreign points routed through US switchboards. This activity lasted for approximately six months but has ceased.

11. This information deleted because it reveals sensitive operational techniques and methods.

SUBJECT : Activity Related to Domestic Events

1. In late spring of 1968 Walt Rostow, then Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, tasked the DCI with undertaking a survey of worldwide student dissidence. Confronted by timult at campuses like Columbia and mindful of the violence accompanying student outbursts at Berlin's Free University and elsewhere, Rostow sought to learn whether youthful dissidence was interconnected: spawned by the same causes; financed and hence manipulated by forces or influences hostil to the interests of the US and its allies; or likely to come under inimical sway to the detriment of US interests.

2. The paper was prepared by Paul Corscadden of OCI with the assistance of the CA and CI Staffs. The DDI, D/OCI, and Corscadden met with Rostow to elicit the reasons for his or the President's concerns and to agree on the sources to be examined, the research methods to be followed, etc.

3. Written during the summer of 1968, the most sensitive version of *Restless Youth* comprised two sections. The first was a philosophical treatment of student unrest, its motivation, histor, and tactics. This section drew heavily on overt literature and FBI reporting on Students for a Democratic Society and affiliated groups. In a sense, the survey of dissent emerged from a shorter (30 page) typescript study of SDS and its foreign ties the same author had done for Mr. Rostow at the DCI's request in December 1967. (We no longer have a copy.)

4. Because of the paucity of information on foreign student movements, it was necessary to focus on SDS which then monopolized the field of student action here and abroad. A second section comprised 19 country chapters--ranging from Argentina to Yugoslavia--and stood by itself as a review of foreign student dissidence.

5. Because SDS was a domestic organization, the full paper *Restless Youth*, including the essay on world-wide dissent went only to nine readers. A copy may be in the Johnson Library.

6. Following the paper's favorable reception by the President and Mr. Rostow, the DCI briefed the NSC on student dissent. The sensitive version subsequently was updated and sent to the White House in February 1969.

7. The less sensitive text was disseminated in September 1968 and then updated and issued again in March 1969 and August 1970.

The main purpose of these reports, prepared at the request of the White House, was to determine whether any links existed between international Communist elements or foreign governments and the American peace movement. The conclusion reached was that there was some evidence of ad hoc contacts between anti-war activists at home and abroad but no evidence of direction or formal coordination.

2. In October 1967 President Johnson expressed interest in this subject and ordered a high level inter-departmental survey. In response to his personal request to the DCI, Mr. Helms asked the CI Staff to collect whatever information was available through our own sources and through liaison with the FBI and to pass it to OCI, which was directed to prepare a memorandum from the DCI to the President.

3. A book message requirement was sent to all stations to report whatever information was on hand relevant to this subject. Although agent reports on Communist front operations overseas were of some value, the primary source of information on the activities of US activists--and that was quite limited--was sensitive intercepts produced by NSA, which had been similarly tasked by the White House.

4. A draft memorandum was jointly prepared by OCI and CI Staff and forwarded to the DCI. He passed this typescript memo, dated 15 November 1967, to the President personally. The White House copy is now in the files of President Johnson's papers at the library in Austin.

5. Brief follow-up memoranda were prepared and forwarded to the White House on 21 December and 17 January 1968. According to our best recollection, no further finished intelligence reports on international connections of the peace movement were produced.

MEMORANDUM FOR: O/DDI

SUBJECT: Involvement In Domestic Affairs

1: This memorandum responds to the DDI's request for a listing of any questionable involvements in domestic affairs. I do not believe that CRS is doing anything that a reasonable man could construe as improper.

2. CRS does, of course, have several programs to acquire still pictures, movies, videotapes and books either privately, secretly or without acknowledgement that CIA is the actual end user. CRS is regularly involved with Customs in looking at the content of film cans addressed to the Russian Embassy in Washington. Customs occasionally also provides access to other film from denied areas. It may be addressed to private citizens or organizations or other embassies. These efforts are aimed at acquisition of positive foreign information.

3. CRS files do not generally bear on U.S. citizens or organizations. The biographic file-building criteria specifically excludes U.S. nationals unless the person has become of such major importance in the political life of a foreign country that the file is essential. (To my knowledge, only 2 persons so qualify. One is the wife of the opposition leader of Guyana and the other is Hope Lang. Our Cuban files probably include some persons who are now U.S. citizens but we have no way to separate them; we have files on U.S. defectors to Cuba.)

SUBJECT: Involvement In Domestic Affairs

4. The CIA Library has several informal snag files intended to aid the librarians in answering the kinds of questions that they know they will get on a continuing basis. An appointments file is a collection of clippings on appointed federal officials: who holds what job when and what is his background? The extremist files are a collection of folders on a variety of organizations and a few people with intricate organizational links. Any sort of extremism is grist for these particular files. And a few persons, e.g., Rap Brown and Eldridge Cleaver, have dossiers consisting almost exclusively of clippings from public media. These files are unclassified and consist mostly of clippings from the public press: U.S., foreign, underground, scholarly.

5. I am not aware of any other kind of involvement in domestic activities that is not related to development of techniques or logistics or legitimate training of CRS personnel.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DDI

SUBJECT: Sensitive Activities

1. FBIS has been engaged in no activities related to the Ellsberg and Watergate cases.

2. FBIS operations occasionally extend to the domestic arena. From time to time, FBIS linguists are made available to DDO or Office of Communications components for special operations (usually abroad) involving close-support SIGINT work or translation of audio take. On one occasion recently DDO, on behalf of the FBI, requested the services of several FBIS linguists skilled in Arabic to work directly for the FBI on a short- term project here in Washington. The arrangements were made by Mr. Oberg of the DDO CI Staff. He said the project was very highly classified and that FBIS participation was approved by Mr. Colby and the Director. FBIS participation was approved by the Director of FBIS after a check with the ADDI.. Other examples of sensitive linguistic support work are help in the handling and resettlement of defectors, the recent assignment of an employee to the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs to transcribe recordings in a rare Chinese dialect, and the detailing of another Chinese linguist on two occasions to assist in the U.S. military training of Chinese Nationalist cadets.

3. Within its responsibility for monitoring press agency trans- missions for intelligence information, FBIS publishes and distributes some material which falls in a "gray" area of copyright protection, libel, and privacy of international communications. Press services controlled by national governments and transmitted by radioteletype without specific addressees, e.g. the Soviet TASS service and the PRC's NCNA, are monitored by FBIS and the material is disseminated without restric- tion. The legality of this has been affirmed by decisions of the Office of General Counsel. However, we also monitor some in-house, correspondent-to-headquarters dispatches which are considered private point-to-point transmissions. FBIS therefore avoids public distribution of material monitored from these circuits by labeling them with an "Official Use Only" caveat. The same caveat is used on material which we monitor from other press agencies which are protected by international copyright, e.g. Agence France Presse (AFP), the Middle East News Agency (MENA), and the Iraqi Nes Agency (INA). This procedure has allowed FBIS to disseminate news

SECRET

NW 88296 Docld: 32989624 Page 82


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 83

# SECRET

agency material for nearly three decades without problems. Recently, however, the Office of General Counsel has ruled that an "Official Use Only" caveat will not bar such material from the general public under the Freedom of Information Law and we are accordingly looking into alternative measures, among which are: (1) the purchase of news services with rights to publish and disseminate; and (2) the classification of those items vital to the government's business which we must continue to monitor and report. An ultimate decision will be weighed against the risk of present procedures.

4. The routine FBIS monitoring of foreign radio broadcasts often involves statements or speeches made by U.S. citizens using those radio facilities. Examples are statements made or allegedly made by American POW's in Hanoi, by Jane Fonda in Hanoi and by Ramsey Clark in Vietnam. At the request of FBI and the Department of Justice, and with the approval of the CIA Office of General Counsel, we have on occasion submitted transcripts of such broadcasts to the Department of Justice as part of that Department's consideration of a possible trial. In such cases, we have been required to submit nanes of FBIS monitors involved, presumably because of the possibility they might be required as witnesses. (In one case in 1971, an FBIS staff employee was directed to appear as an expert witness in the court-martial of a Marine enlisted man charged with aiding the enemy in a broadcast from Hanoi.) FBIS views all this with misgivings. Monitoring of such broadcasts is incidental and we rue attribution of their news to FBIS, and we should not be considered policemen maintaining surveillance of traveling Americans.

5. FBIS is an overt organization, but one aspect of its operations is under Department of Commerce cover. The Joint Publications Research Service (JPRS) was established in 1957 to provide the means through which great volumes of material from unclassified foreign publications could be translated by large numbers of independent contractors in the United States on a piece rate basis. Contractors are not witting of their CIA employment. This use of cover is an anomaly in FBIS and contains some risk of embarrassment to the Agency and to Commerce if it becomes public knowledge. The surfacing of JPRS was given study in 1969, but after consideration of all the pros and cons it was decided at the Executive Director-Comptroller level not to proceed at that time. FBIS is presently taking a second look.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Science & Technology

SUBJECT : TSD Support to Other Agencies

1. Technical Services Division's charter (CSI 1-8) requires that it provide technical assistance to both CIA operations and other activities as may be directed by the Deputy Director for Operations.

2. Over the years the chief non-CIA recipients of this support have been the Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of State, United States Postal Service, Secret Service, Agency for International Development, and the White House.

3. While varying widely among the different recipients, these services have included training and materials, and in a few instances participation in the fields of audio and visual surveillance, secret writing and related communications, personal protection, disguise, concealment devices, electronic beaconry, illicit narcotics detection, and counter-sabotage/terrorism.

4. In most instances requirements for this support are received by TSD through higher echelons (Office of the Director or Deputy Director for Operations). Unless the service involved is a trivial or continuing one, the request is referred to the Foreign Intelligence Staff Departmental Coordination Group for coordination and approval at the appropriate Agency levels. Approval within TSD by the Chief of Operations or Development and Engineering and the Chief of TSD or his Deputy also is required.

5. The attachment lists the primary services provided to the organizations named in Paragraph two.

This information deleted because it reveals sensitive operational techniques and methods.

8. Provision of forged documentation to non-DDO requesters, whether they be CIA or other Agency requesters, always requires approval of non-TSD offices. Support to the military for instance would be validated by FI Staff/Departmental Coordination Group at Headquarters or by the COS overseas having responsibility for coordination of the operation. BNDD requests are coordinated with DDO/NARCOG. Requests for documentation of Immigration and Naturalization Service is coordinated via the Alien Affairs Staff.

9. Authentication items are issued on a loan basis and must be returned to TSD or accounted for. After any documentation has been issued, TSD retains photographs and records of such support until the documentation has been returned to TSD. If the material is not returned after a reasonable time, the requester is reminded of the outstanding documentation.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

TSD has had a close working relationship with the FBI over the past few years. The FBI is the only organization that has been fully briefed on TSD audio techniques and equipment. The following are situations where TSD equipment and guidance were involved in operations:

(A) Identity 59 - Four masked transmitters were installed. Two have failed and two remain workable.

(B) Identity 60 - A TSD built masked transmitter was-installed to collect emanations from a crypto- graphic machine. The system continues to function when samples of the emanations are needed.

(C) Identity 61 - Two transmitters have been installed and are operating. One is specifically designed to collect the sounds of typewriting, the other is a straight audio transmitter to collect con- versations. A FBI agent is manning the listening post. A third system is not oper- ating, probably due to battery expiration. The tape made from this room was made by the National Security Agency before failure.

(D) Identity 62 - TSD furnished equipment and con- sultation covering Identity 62

First masked switched trans- mitters were used in two apartments used as tempor- ary quarters. Later masked switched transmitters and microwave transmitters were installed in the permanent quarters along with mic and wire installa- tions, entirely furnished by the Bureau. This install- ation is not fully operational because the full comple- ment of personnel have not yet arrived.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 91

(E) Iden 4 - This is an operation with additional participation by National Security Agency. It is designed in anticipation of the Identity 64 in Washington. The listening post was obtained by using the Agency covert mechanisms for procuring the property. New systems are being designed and produced by using TSD's covert contractor mechanisms and TSD engineers.

(F) Identity 65 - Ten masked audio devices purchased from TSD were installed in Identity 65 by the FBI. Part of the equipment was installed in November and December 1971, the remaining equipment was installed 17 - 25 March 1972. Tests made by a TSD officer from a temporary FBI listening post on 8 - 9 November 1972, proved that the target equipment no longer functioned and was believed discovered by the occupants.

(G) TSD has furnished equipment items which constitute an on-the-shelf capability to engage in photo and audio surveillance operations which might not be known to the Agency. In one case it is known that a relatively unsophisticated device was used against a domestic target.

TSD/SDB Memo #138-73

8 May 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, TSD

ATTENTION: Executive Officer

SUBJECT: Contacts with Domestic Police Organizations

1. In December 1968, July 1969 and December 1970, SDB provided basic countersabotage familiarization training for selected members of the Washington metropolitan area police departments. The training was given at the Fairfax County police pistol and rifle range. Authorization for the training came from DDP and Chief, Office of Security.

2. On occasion during the past few years, under the auspices of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration of the Department of Justice and with the approval of CI Staff and Office of Security, SDB provided training and familiarization to police officers of several domestic police departments in the uses of the Explosives Residue Detection Technique and Trace Metals Detection Technique. These techniques had been declassified and are currently available to the law enforcement community. The National Bomb Data Center publishes periodic guidance in their uses.

3. In order to augment the SDB mission responsibilities in the field of countersabotage and counterterror, SDB officers have in the past two years visited, under appropriate covers, the explosives disposal units of the New York City police department, Dade County (Miami) Florida Dept. and the Los Angeles Police Dept. Also, in March 1973, two SDB officers attended the Explosives and Ordnance Disposal Conference in Sacramento, California, sponsored by LEAA. When the recent letter bomb menace began in September 1972, our liaison with the NYCPD bomb squad paid off in that we had complete information on letter bomb construction in hours, enabling the Agency to make worldwide dissemination within a day.

# DOMESTIC TESTS FOR
AGENCY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS

1. As a normal part of ORD's efforts in the research and development of equipment and techniques for Agency applications in foreign intelligence, we conduct experiments and tests in the United States. Clearly, the design and development of our intelligence equipments can be done more economically and more securely in this country. Although most of the tests of our R&D equipments are performed in closed laboratories or in secure areas simulating the foreign environment, some of the tests and experiments, of necessity, reveal domestic information.

2. A review of the surveillance equipment or techniques which have at some time or other been exposed to domestic testing is as follows:

a. Laser Probe - About 1967, the laser probe developed by ORD was tested by TSD in San Francisco under very closely controlled conditions. The ORD Project Officer witnessed portions of the test. Recordings that were made of laser probe output were carefully controlled as classified material and it is believed that the tapes have long since been destroyed. (Wood/TA)

b. Microwave Intercept System - About 1968, this system was tested in a light aircraft near the Naval Ordnance Test Station in Identity 127:, California. This system is designed to permit intercept of microwave telephone communication channels of systems such as Identity 130
It works equally well against the Bell Telephone TD-2, as they are generically the same. Recordings of these telephone intercepts were carefully controlled and were destroyed several years ago.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

# SUBJECT: Domestic Tests for Agency Research and Development Efforts

c. Telephone Intrusion Study - The objective of this current program is to develop a means to utilize foreign telephone systems as a communication link without the knowledge of the host system. In order to carry out this objective, it is necessary to learn the complete supervisory signalling and sequencing control system hierarchy for the various foreign telephone systems. Many of these are patterned after the U.S. system and, for this reason, limited monitoring to test the operation of intercept equipment in the United States is planned. The data to be collected would be merely the signal tones from which supervisory codes can be extracted. Message content is of no interest and will not be recorded. Overseas testing is planned at a subsequent date. To date, some domestic testing of this concept has been carried out at the contractor's plant. No recordings have been made of such data. Extremely brief tests exercising U.S. and foreign telephone systems through supervisory tone signalling have been carried out to verify initial concepts. The duration of testing was less than one-half hour.

d. Other Sensor Testing - Examples of engineering development tests of special sensors within the United States include infrared and high-altitude photography, forward-looking IR (FLIR) flights, laser scanners, industrial effluent sampling for isotopes, and airborne magnetometer surveys for metal (rifles and trucks). In all these cases, the data output of such testing has been used for engineering development and the content has been restricted to dissemination to those in Government involved with the engineering design.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

# SUBJECT: Dometic Tests for Agency Reserch and
Devdopment Efforts

e. Remote Physiological Measurements -
An ORD-developed cryogenic magnetometer is
being tested at a contractor's site for use
as a remote cardiograph (magnetocardiograph).
Some test subjects are witting, but most tests
are on naive subjects (they do not know they
are being tested). The magnetometer is com-
pletely harmless to the subject and the test
results are closely helá.

f. Personality Structure of Defectors
Study - ORD undertook to determine the per-
sonality structure of defectors during the
period 1966-69. The work primarily involved
an analysis of the open literature on known
defectors. An ancillary effort was concerned
with a study of the phenomenon of defection
itself, i.e., leaving one religion for another,
or changing one set of political beliefs for
another. The work was conducted at Stanford
University. Identity 125/LS)

g. Trained Birds - Birds have been trained
and tested in the United States to carry small
intelligence collecting packages such as audio
surveillance devices, small cameras, and cur-
rent measuring devices. Any data collected
from unwitting domestic sources would have been
used only for engineering purposes and then
destroyed.

h. Communications Link Loading Study - In
the period from 1970 through 1972 various means
were used to check out an intercept system designed
to operate against Iden 93 communications links.
Under carefully controlled conditions, some U. S.
microwave communications were recorded and passed
through the intercept system under test to prove
quality of performance. All intercept material
connected with this was destroyed within a few weeks
of the time of intercept and the material was never
checked for substantive content. NSA participated
and controlled most elements of the U. S. material.

29 MAY 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Secretary, CIA Management
Committee

SUBJECT: Reported Identity 61, Burglary

1. Attached is a report summarizing what we know about the reported break-in of Identity 61. An investigative report by an officer of the Executive Protective Service states that the offices were ransacked and a number of personal items stolen.

2. The attached summary also describes a separate audio operation conducted against Identity 61 by the FBI, at the Agency's behest and with its technical support. This presents a related question that should be noted. James McCord's' testimony indicates that he placed telephone calls to the Identity 75 and Identity 61. He says he picked the numbers at random, hoping that if his phone was tapped his attorneys would be able to challenge the evidence as being tainted. Another witness, John Caulfield, says McCord called the two named Iden 75 and Iden 61 because he "was sure" they "were subjects of national security wiretaps."

3. In fact, there has been a long-standing telephone tap on the Identity 75, run by the FBI, about which CI Staff believes McCord knew. It is possible that he also had an inkling of some sort of operation against Identity 61, and assumed that it was also a telephone tap. One must speculate that he played for double insurance, hoping that both his telephones and those of the Iden 75 and Iden 61 were tapped, and that one way or another his case would be dismissed or dropped because of tainted evidence or to avoid revealing the sensitive operations. At this point, given the publicity of the Iden 61 break-in, and the testimony of McCord and Caulfield, the current investigations may lead to exposure of the operations.

# 24 May 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT: Reported Burglary of the Identity 61

1. The press reported a burglary of Identity 61 13-14 May 1973. An investigative report by an officer of the Executive Protective Service states that the offices were ransacked and a number of personal items were stolen. There were some latent fingerprints, but no identification was made. The FBI, which states that the incident was on 15 May, did not investigate because it determined that it did not have jurisdiction. The Identity 61 registered a formal complaint and American regrets were expressed, Identity 61 making it clear that they suspected something other than ordinary robbery. We have no additional information on the subject. There had been an earlier intelligence operation against the Identity 61 which is described below.

2. On 16 April 1971 the Agency proposed to the FBI the installation of technical coverage of Identity 61 The opportunity for such an installation came about when a domestic asset of Foreign Resources Division reported that he had been asked to submit a bid for a contract to renovate Identity 61 Upon securing the contract the asset was willing to augment his work force as appropriate or install material which would be provided him. The Agency proposed to turn this asset over to the FBI and to provide technical and logistic support. The value of such an operation to the intelligence community was cited.

3. On 23 April 1971 FBI Director John Edgar Hoover turned down the Agency proposal. That same day CIA Director Richard Helms sent a letter to Attorney-General John Mitchell requesting that the FBI turndown be reversed, citing the importance of the Iden 61 target and national intelligence needs to collect positive intelligence. On 24 April the Attorney-General reversed the FBI decision and the Washington Field Office of the Bureau was instructed to proceed with the operation.

![signature and classification markings]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

4. During the period from 26 April to 18 May all the technical equipment from the Agency to the FBI was delivered, installed and tested. Everything seemed to be working. No Agency personnel were involved in any way with actual installation of equipment in Identity 61 From May to February Agency technicians helped calibrate, reset and do other repair work on occasions of equipment failure in the FBI listening post. On no occasion did they enter Identity 61.

5. The Agency requested that coverage of Identity 61 be stopped on 3 February 1972 after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover advised that he was scheduled shortly to testify in Congress and might have to advise them that the installation in Identity 61 was initiated at CIA's request. The operation and equipment, to the best of the Agency's knowledge, was dormant until 8 December 1972 when the FBI was asked by the Agency to reactivate coverage. The request at this time was occasioned by the knowledge that a Iden 76 delegation would be arriving in Washington for discussions on nationalization of foreign holdings, While the FBI was still in the process of reactivating the equipment, the Department of State on 20 December 1972 requested the FBI to institute all possible coverage of Identity 61 and on 22 December 1972 coverage was partially reinstituted with full coverage in effect by 26 December 1972.

6. A review of the take from the operation, weighed against the risks involved, led the Agency to conclude that the activity was not worth continuing. On 16 February 1973 CIA requested the FBI to discontinue the coverage. On 22 February 1973 the FBI advised that microphone surveillance of Iden 61 was discontinued.

SUBJECT: Break-in at Identity 61

1. Information has been received from WH Division which indicates that there was a break-in at Identity 61 on the weekend of 13-14 May 1972. The Iden 76 Desk of WH Division has no knowledge of Bureau coverage at that time.

2. I discussed the Iden 76 matter with Iden 66 of CI Staff (Red 1731), who advised that the FBI did have coverage of Identity 61, and the Agency supported this operation. He indicated that this was identified as Operation WUDOOR and he would be able to provide additional details on this if Mr. Colby requests it.

SUBJECT: WII Comments on Jack Anderson Column

REFERENCE: Jack Anderson's Washington Merry-Go-Round Column of S March 1972: "Chilean Break-ins Reflect watergate"

1. WII Division has reviewed the referenced column (copy attached) by Jack Anderson and finds that it contains no new information. To the best knowledge of the Division, there is no foundation to the allegation that 2. Howard Hunt was engaged on behalf of ITT in breaking into Chilean diplomatic installations in Washington and New York.

2. Any connection between ITT and these break-ins is purely conjectural and the column takes care to point this out.

3. Harold Hendrix, ITT Latin American representative, has told us that he had no relationship with Hunt on this or any ITT matter. He had anticipated that Anderson might inply such a relationship in his column and had assured us that this was not true.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Identity 61 Break In on 15 May 1972

1. On 24 May 1973 I telephoned Mr. James Robinson,
   General Crime Section, Department of Justice and asked if he
   had any information as to criminal prosecution of persons involved
   in a break in at Identity 61 in Washington, D.C. on
   15 May 1972. Mr. Robinson stated he had no knowledge of this but
   suggested that it would be better to check with Mr. G. Marvin Gentile,
   Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security, Department of State, and
   the Secret Service since they had responsibilities for the Executive
   Protective Service (EPS). I telephoned Mr. Gentile and he identi-
   fied two State Department cables relative to the incident; one from
   the embassy in Santiago to the Department, No. 2450, dated
   15 May 1972, Subject: Unauthorized Entry Outlining the Protest
   of the Iden 76 Covernment presented to the American Embassy,
   and the State Department reply to Santiago, No. 084655, dated
   15 May 1972. Mr. Gentile also identified the EPS report of
   investigation and suggested that I get a copy from the Secret Service.
   I then called Mr. Tom Kelly at Secret Service and he had his liaison
   man deliver me a copy of the EPS report of investigation.

2. On 25 May 1973 I received a call from FBI Agent
   Ray Mullens on green phone No. 5303 stating that he had received
   a telephone call from Mr. James Robinson relative to my inquiry
   about prosecution. Mr. Mullens indicated that the FBI Washington
   Field Office had recontacted the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD)
   on 24 May and reviewed the report No. 248-424 filed with the 3rd
   District, MPD which states that a break in occurred at Identity 61.
   between 5:00 and 8:00 a.m. on 15 May 1972.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 122

Reported loss at tha me consisted of four am/fmadios
and one electric razor. The police investigation identified
some latent fingerprints but no identification of those prints
was made. Since the reported loss was under $5,000 and there
was. no evidence of a crossing of state boundries, the FBI did
not make an investigation of the incident. The MPD reported
that there had been no prosecution and no suspect was identified.

1. June 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. William E. Colby

SUBJECT: Special Activities

1.  Following our recent conversation, I have searched my memory and Mr. McCone's files for examples of activities which to hostile observers or to someone without complete knowledge and with a special kind of motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities exceeding CIA's charter.

2.  First, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962, DCI McCone, under pressure from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, agreed to tap the telephones of columnists Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott in an effort to identify their sources for classified information which was appearing in their columns. Because the primary source appeared to be in the Department of Defense, McCone ordered me personally to brief General Joe Carroll, Director of DIA, orally, which I did. I understand more complete information on this operation is available from the Director of Security. I, personally, managed to avoid gaining any knowledge of what precise actions were taken, what information was gained, what was done with it, and when the operation was terminated.

3.  As a result of a developing relationship with IDEN-122 theIDEN-123representative in Washington, and also as a result of certain information conveyed by IDEN-124, James Angleton, with the approval of Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation against the IDEN-95 in Washington. This involved breaking and entering and the removal of documents from

the IDEN-126 On 18 June 1962, DCI McCone and Helms briefed Secretary of State Rusk generally.on the operation without going into operational details. Later on the same day, President John F. Kennedy was briefed. Actual breaking and entering occurred somewhat later, and on 15 April 1963, DCI McCone met with President Kennedy alone and briefed the President on the details of this new phase of the operation. On the same day, the Attorney General was briefed and he agreed that he would not mention it to the FBI unless the FBI themselves raised it with him. On 3 February 1964, DCI McCone met alone with President Lyndon B. Johnson and briefed him on the operation. On 4 February McGeorge Bundy was briefed. On 6 February 1964 in a briefing of Secretary of State Rusk on the results of the operation, Rusk expressed reservations about the propriety of such an operation. He raised this same concern in subsequent conversations with McCone on 17 April 1964, 28 May 1964, and 14 June 1964. On 12 September 1964 Rusk continued to express grave reservations and repeatedly suggested that the IDEN-95 be informed directly that we knew about their espionage operations in the United States and ask them to desist. In a meeting on 28 May 1964 Rusk expressed these reservations in the presence of DCI MeCone and President John F. Kennedy. Secretary of Defense McNamara was also present, and there is no record that he had previously been made aware of this operation.

4. Although certain activities never got beyond the planning stage, there are, I believe, three examples of such planning which could be subject to misinterpretation. One involved chemical warfare operations against the rice crops in both Cuba and North Vietnam. A second involved a paramilitary strike against the Chi-Com nuclear installations. Outside the United States Government, General Eisenhower was briefed on such planning. A third, which assumes a new significance today, involved a proposal by Angleton and Helms for a greatly increased intelligence collection effort against foreign installations in this country. This planning also involved a scheme for selected

exposure of KGB activities and counteractions against the Soviet intelligence service. The reasons are still unclear to me as to why the FBI chose to brief the PFIAB to the effect that CIA was planning to wiretap extensively and indiscriminately in this country, to greatly increase the Agency representation in the Moscow Embassy, and generally to use KGB-type tactics, also extensively and indiscriminately. This led to a heated exchange between DCI McCone and Mr. Belmont of the FBI, one such meeting taking place in the presence of the Attorney General. It is clear that the FBI was opposed to any such proposal then, as now, and the plan never went forward.

5. During the period when Des FitzGerald was in charge of the Cuban Task Force, DCI McCone's office learned, quite by accident, that FitzGerald had secured the cooperation of several prominent US business firms in denying economic items to Cuba. There was no question but that the businessmen were glad to cooperate, but knowledge of this operation had to be rather widespread.

6. On 17 April 1964, Mr. Robert B. Anderson came to DCI McCone on behalf of American business interests, offering to insert some $300,000 to try to secure a favorable result in the elections in Panama. Shortly after this approach, IDEN-128 of IDEN-129 made a similar proposal to MeCone in connection with elections in Chile. On 12 May 1964 at a meeting of the 303 Committee, it was decided that the offers of American business could not be accepted, it being neither a secure way nor an honorable way of doing such business. This declaration of policy at this time bears on the recent ITT hearings, but I am not surprised that McCone has forgotten that he helped to set the precedent of refusing to accept such collaboration between the Agency's operations and private business.

7. At the direction of Attorney General Robert Kennedy and with the explicit approval of President Kennedy, McCone injected the Agency, and particularly IDEN-36

into the US labor situation, and particularly to try to ameliorate the quarrel between George Meany and Walter Reuther. IDEN-36 steered a very skillful course in this connection, but the Agency could be vulnerable to charges that we went behind Meany's back, or were somehow consorting with Reuther against Meany's wishes.

8. There are three examples of using Agency funds which I know to be controversial. One was the expenditure of money under Project MOSES in securing the release of Cuban Brigade prisoners. Details of this operation are best known to Larry Houston, Mike Miskovsky IDEN-131 , and James Smith. Second, as you well know, when Lou Concin received his summons to report to the Joint General Staff Headquarters on 1 November 1963 a large amount of cash went with him. My impression is that the accounting for this and its use has never been very frank or complete. Third, at one of the early Special Group meetings attended by McCone he took strong exception to proposals to spend Agency funds to improve the economic viability of West Berlin, and for an investment program in Mali. His general position was that such expenditures were not within the Agency's charter, and that he would allow such spending only on the direct personal request of the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense, or the White House.

9. I raise these issues of funding because I remember the Agency's being severely criticized by the House Appropriations Subcommittee for having spent $3,000 for stamps in connection with a program to buy tractors to secure the release of prisoners from Cuba.

10. Under the heading of old business, I know that any one who has worked in the Director's office has worried about the fact that conversations within the offices and over the telephones were transcribed. During McCone's


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 127

SECRET/SENSITIVE

tenure, there were microphones in his regular office, his inner office, his dining room, his office in East Building, and his study at his residence on White Haven Street. I do not know who would be willing to raise such an issue, but knowledge of such operations tends to spread, and certainly the Agency is vulnerable on this score.

11. Also under the heading of old business, I well remember the hue and cry raised, especially by Carl Kaysen in the White House, when the Agency injected a contaminating agent in Cuban sugar bound for the Soviet Union. Shortly after the Cuban missile crisis, there was a disposition in Washington to reexamine the Bay of Pigs, and the fact that several Alabama National Air Guard officers lost their lives in the Bay of Pigs was surfaced with surprisingly little excitement at the time.

12. During my stint on the 7th floor there was a special arrangement with the Office of Communications whereby the Director's office gained access to non-CIA traffic. This surfaced briefly at one point shortly after Admiral Rayborn became DCI. He had visited the Signal Center and removed a copy of a telegram from the Embassy in the Dominican Republic for Under Secretary George Ball, Eyes Only. He returned to his office and proceeded to discuss this telegram with George Ball who was naturally quite curious as to how Rayborn knew about it, and also as to how Rayborn had it in his possession before Ball did. Ben Read in the Secretary of State's office and I spent several weeks putting this one to rest.

13. Finally, DCI McCone, as you and I well know, operated on a very lofty plane, and I think certain of his activities could be misunderstood: One example was his decision in July of 1964 to have Aristotle Onassis and Maria Callas flown from Rome to Athens on Air Force KC 135. Their arrival in Athens in this airplane attracted the attention of the local press and in due course Mr. John

![image of illegible text]

EVES ONLY

Hightower, Chief of the Associated Press Bureau for Washington, came to see me to ask about the propriety of this action.

14. The use of IDEN-132 aircraft has been remarkably secure, but DCI McCone himself forgot about the cover arrangement and became quite exercised when he saw Candidate Goldwater land in the San Francisco airport for the Republican National Convention in 1964 aboard the IDEN-133 with the highly visible tail number IDEN-134. This was, I explained to him carefully, a perfectly legitimate charter, but he didn't like it.

15. McCone dealt quite extensively with newsmen in Washington. In fact, they gave him a gift and a luncheon when he left Washington, which is perhaps indicative of the press's relations with him. However, in the case of the Ross and Wise book, *The Invisible Government*, he did try to bring pressure on the publisher and the authors to change things. They did not change a comma, and I doubt that this old saw will ever sing again.

16. Finally, and this will reflect my Middle Western Protestant upbringing, McCone's dealings with the Vatican, including Pope John XXIII and Pope Paul VI, would and could raise eyebrows in certain quarters.

17. The above listing is uneven, but I have a sinking feeling that discipline has broken down, and that allegations from any quarter which cast these things in the wrong light would receive great publicity and attention, and no amount of denial would ever set the record straight. If I may be of any assistance in tracking down further details, I am of course at your disposal, but I would point

NW 88296 Docld:32989624 Page 128


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

out that I was very much in the position of the enlisted man who knew that the commissioned officers were aware of these activities and better able to judge their propriety and possible impact or misinterpretation.

Although targetted overseas these agents are often exposed to and directed against American radical, leftist, and communist targets to gain a practical knowledge of the leftwing, radical, communist world. There is a possibility that an asset might become suspect and be accused of being an employee of the Agency or the Bureau; or it might happen some asset would, for some reason, become disenchanted with his role and expose his Agency relationship and his activities, with resultant embarrassment. To minimize potential problems, therefore, each case is cleared with the FBI and through CI/SO the Bureau is kept. informed on a regular basis.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Technical Operation Against IDEN-76 Embassy in 1971 and 1972

1. A technical penetration of the IDEN-76 Embassy in Washington, D. C. was mounted by the FBI with the support of this Agency in April-May 1971. This operation, which used Agency equipment and technical expertise but was managed operationally by the FBI, was initiated only after then-Director Richard Helms had gone over the head of former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to obtain the approval of then-Attorney General John N. Mitchell. The operation was discontinued at the Agency's request on 2 February 1972 when it appeared that Director Hoover intended to testify before Congress concerning audio installations in the U.S. and identify this operation as CIA instigated.

2. The operation consisted of the following three technical devices:

a. An AC-powered, masked transmitter and two switches in the office occupied by the Deputy-Chief of Mission.

b. An AC-powered, masked transmitter in the office of the Ambassador's secretary which was


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 132

designed to pick up high quality audio of typing in the office. It was hoped to break these audio signals into clear text using advanced computer techniques developed by Division D. No useful product, however, was ever obtained.

c. A battery-powered, masked transmitter and switch concealed in the door of the Embassy, which would supply crytographic information for NSA. (Produced excellent quality signals until it became inoperative in early 1972 because of battery failure.)

3. In December 1972 the Agency requested reactivation of the operation for a 60-day trial period in spite of the limited value of intelligence produced previously (22 disseminations of only moderate interest). Reactivation was requested because of strong interest in the special IDEN-76 government mission arriving in Washington in late December to conduct high-level talks with U.S. State Department officials concerning debt renegotiation and other major items outstanding between-the-two-countries. The operation was reinitiated on 21 December 1972 but was discontinued again on 22 February 1973 by Acting


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 133

Director L. Patrick Gray at this Agency's request. Our request was prompted by a decision that the intelligence production of this operation did not justify the risks involved in continuing to run it in the sensitive political climate caused by the mounting disclosures about CIA involvement in LWEN-76 This was especially so because of our reservations about maintaining proper security for the listening post which, as with other operational aspects of the case, was under FBI management.

e. Alias Social Security Cards. 171 backstopped accounts have been established for contract personnel whose relationship with the Agency cannot be revealed but who are entitled to Social Security coverage. Following expiration of the contractual relationship, at an appropriate time the alias and true name accounts are merged permitting the individual to receive complete benefits upon reaching the age of eligibility.

f. Alias IRS Tax Accounts. 54 Social Security numbers have been registered for the purpose of opening 54 new bank accounts since 1 July 1972. 87 individual tax accounts have been established with IRS on an unwitting basis in 14 cities in the United States.

g. Notional Facilities. 311 notional facilities (43 corporations: 61 sole-proprietorships; 207 lawyers and 61 telephone answering service addresses are maintained by CCS in 58 cities in the United States.

k. Credit Union Arrangements for Selected Non-official Cover Torsonnel. Dividends (interest) earned on Credit Union accounts by individuals under cover are not reported to the Internal Revenue Service based on 50 U.S. Code 403g or Internal Revenue Code Section 6041.

Individuals under cover may borrow money from the Credit Union for the purchase of real estate; however, the mortgage is recorded in the name of a cleared lawyer and not the actual lendor (Credit Union).

Paragraph 1. deleted because it contains sensitive Agency operational methods and techniques.

# CORPORATE COVER

1.  Central Cover Staff (CCS) is responsible for the placement of Agency operational personnel under the cover of bona fide U.S. companies abroad and in the U.S. This process involves the selection of companies; research on their locations and key personnel; clearances; contacts with companies to solicit cooperation with the Agency; arrangements for integration of Agency personnel into the companies, including letters of understanding; funding of salaries, allowances and expenses; and, continuous monitoring of each integrated case throughout the course of the cover use. The overall objective is to match the individual being placed, the company, and the location, in a manner that will ensure achievement of the Agency purpose and protection of the company integrity.

2.  Currently, there are 191 integrees for whom cover is provided by 140 companies; 179 integrees are located in 47 foreign countries and 12 are located in the United States. To maintain this placement level, CCS personnel are researching and monitoring approximately 250 to 300 companies at any given time.

3.  To minimize the adverse consequences to a cooperating company, and to preserve the Agency's operational equity in the event of exposure of an individual under cover, it has been established policy that no more than two individuals would be furnished cover by the same company. At the present time this ratio is confined to approximately 25% of the total number of companies now being used and efforts are under way to effect further reductions toward the goal of one individual per company.

4.  In addition to the primary corporate cover function described in paragraph 1. above, CCS maintains continuing contact with two U.S. car rental firms and two U.S. credit card firms for the purpose of obtaining backstopped credit cards in alias for operational use in the United States and abroad by Agency personnel. 42 such cards are now being used by 34 individuals.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 137

SECRET

DEVISED FACILITIES COVER

1. Central Cover Staff (CCS) maintains 311 back-stopped notional facilities which were created to provide cover for Agency personnel in the United States and abroad and to provide an attributable source for Agency funds used in operations and requiring concealment of Agency or U.S. Government interest. The facilities comprise 43 corporations providing personal status cover, payrolling and tax attribution sources, and other miscellaneous support such as title to property, funding, etc.; 61 sole-proprietorships providing status and operational cover, including payrolling and tax attribution; and 207 non-registered companies providing support for high risk operational requirements, agents abroad, corporate reimbursements, and proprietary funding.

2. 224 Agency personnel engaged in operational activities are payrolled by the facilities, an essential procedure permitting the reporting of Agency salaries without documenting the Agency as the source.

3. The facilities provide a capability for passing Agency funds to 30 Agency proprietaries and 97 bona fide companies on a continuing basis. 225 bank accounts located in 36 banks throughout the United States provide the mechanisms for transmittal of these funds.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 138

SECRET

PROPRIETARY ENTITY COVER

1. Central Cover Staff (CCS) maintains three domestic proprietary management companies which provide funding and operational support for 49 Agency entities, including 13 controlled and directed by CCS.

2. The three proprietary management companies are staffed by 9 employees; they furnish assistance in the commercial, business and investment aspects of on-going operations, manage the legal and commercial affairs of entities supporting operations, and provide cover and funding channels for operational activities as required. Most importantly, professional services are furnished in a manner responsive to required security standards and at a cost considerably less than would be charged by bona fide management firms.

3. The 13 proprietary entities directed by CCS provide cover for ten individuals in the United States and three overseas. Operationally, the companies provide commercial funding channels on a world-wide basis and serve as corporate owners of equipment, inventory and aircraft and as collection mechanisms for outstanding notes and loans in order to conceal U.S. Government affiliation or interest.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Items for Possible Use in Briefing the DCI

1. This Memorandum is submitted in order to identify to you for possible briefing of the Director activities which in certain contexts could be construed as delicate or inappropriate.

2. At the request of the Director of Security, from approximately mid-October 1972 to mid-January 1973 safesite number 583 was made available to the U.S. Marshal's Service for use as a secure residence by an Assistant U.S. Attorney who reportedly was under threat of assassination by organized criminal elements.

3. SB Division over the past three months has interviewed four graduate students as prospective candidates for assignments under American business cover in the USSR. They were encouraged to locate cover jobs on their own.

4. For approximately two years the SB Division has had the cooperation of the Commander of the Morals Division of the District of Columbia Police Department in training officers scheduled for assignment to the USSR and Eastern Europe in how to conduct themselves if placed under arrest. The arrangement was made through the Office of Security.

5. Since late 1972 CIA has taken part in seven FBI training courses at Quantico, Virginia in response to requests from the FBI. We have shared with them through lectures and discussions lessons we have learned which are relevant to their counter- espionage responsibilities.

6. As a means of sharing more fully our operational experience we have invited three FBI officers to be students in our Soviet Operatims Course from 14 to 25 May 1973.

7. A Soviet defector was confined at a CIA facility from April 1964 to September 1967 while efforts were being made to establish whether he was a bona fide defector. Although his present attitude toward the Agency is quite satisfactory, the possibility exists that the press could cause undesirable publicity if it were to uncover the story.

# FOREIGN DISSEMINATION TO DISSENT ABROAD

23 FEB 1972

SUBJECT: Foreign Support For Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Republican National Convention

1. There are only limited indications thus far of foreign efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of activities designed to disrupt or harass the National Convention of the Republican Party in San Diego, 21-23 August 1972.

2. Some American participants at the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina, held 11-13 February 1972 in Paris/Versailles, attempted unsuccessfully to include a call for international demonstrations to take place at the time of the Republican National Convention. A representative of the San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC), one of the domestic action groups targetting on the Republican Convention, requested the American Delegations' Steering Committee at the World Assembly to include a specific call for international support of activities against the Republican convention in their proposal to the Action Commission of the World Assembly. This request, however, was dropped as too divisive by the Steering Committee, despite initial indications that the proposal would be taken to the floor of the Assembly.

3. John LENNON, a British subject, has provided financial support to Project "YES", which in turn paid the travel expenses to the World Assembly of a representative of leading antiwar activist Rennie DAVIS. (DAVIS' representative is tentatively planning to assist in preparations for disruptive actions at the San Diego Convention.) Project "YES" is an adjunct to another LENNON-supported project, the Election Year Strategy Information Center (EYSIC), of which Rennie DAVIS is a key leader, which was set up to direct New Left protest activities at the Republican National Convention. In Paris Rennie DAVIS' representative to the World Assembly met at least once with officials of the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam; it is not known if the Republican National Convention was discussed.

# Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

Indications remain limited, thus far, of foreign efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of activities designed to disrupt or harass the National Convention of the Republican Party in San Diego, 21-23 August 1972. The concept of coordinated international support for domestic activities in the United States was generally endorsed at the recent World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina; however, the Conference issued no specific call for international support of disruptive actions at the American national political conventions.

BACKGROUND:

At the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina, held in Versailles from 10-13 February 1972, there was mention of American plans for demonstrations at both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions. The final draft resolution from the Conference's "Action Commission" contains an appendix submitted by American delegates whose goal was to secure global coordination for domestic actions in the United States. It calls for international support to six weeks of domestic antiwar actions and demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with the statement: "This campaign will lead up to the Democratic Party Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly for the Peace and Independence of the Indochinese People" of 13 February 1972, drafted by the "Political Commission" states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest against the war is voiced more and more strongly, under various forms, such as draft evasions, desertions, resistance, demonstrations which now affect even the soldiers. The Assembly calls for support to these progressive and antiwar forces in the United States, and asks the governments to grant asylum to deserters and to support their right to repatriation. All together, the peoples of the world will efficiently help to impose on the U.S. Government the restoration of peace, and independence and freedom in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

## DEVELOPMENTS:

The San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC), one of the domestic action groups targetting on the Republican Convention, is planning, in addition to demonstrations, for a "large exposition in the campsights (sic) called Expose 72, which with movies, exhibits, displays will portray the struggles of people all over the world." Plans for activities at Expose 72 are believed to include (a) the use of a special television network to broadcast video-taped messages from other countries, including coverage of sympathetic demonstrations elsewhere; and (b) broadcasts over public address systems of live telephone calls from the Vietnamese in Paris and from the Communist Chinese and others at the United Nations. In addition, the SDCC has suggested that, in order to "outflank NIXON domestically and internationally," international opposition can be expressed "by obtaining the authority of other countries and liberation movements to carry their flags in SDCC demonstrations."

# Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Republican National Convention

## SUMMARY:

There is little new evidence of foreign plans or efforts to inspire, support, or take advantage of actions designed to disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in San Diego, 21 to 23 August 1972. The Students for a Democratic Society, in joining the ranks of domestic groups planning actions at the Republican Convention, has adopted a proposal to cooperate with Mexican workers and students in a demonstration in Tijuana, Mexico, during the Convention. The San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC), another domestic group targetting on the Convention, has received a letter of solidarity from the North Vietnamese. The letter is of interest as an indication of North Vietnamese contact with the SDCC; such contact will be required for the SDCC to implement its earlier-reported plans for broadcasts over public address systems during the Convention of live telephone calls from the Vietnamese in Paris.

## DEVELOPMENTS:

At its recent convention in Cambridge, Massachusetts, held 30 March to 2 April 1972, the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) adopted a proposal to hold demonstrations at the San Diego-Tijuana border during the Republican National Convention. The proposal included a call for SDS to cooperate with Mexican workers and students in an action to occur during a fiesta in Tijuana, where Convention delegates will be entertained.

The North Vietnamese have given their endorsement to the San Diego Convention Coalition (SDCC) in the form of a letter from the Vietnam Committee for Solidarity with the American People (VCSWAP), a quasi-official organ of the North Vietnamese Government. The letter, which has been circulated by the SDCC and is dated 27 January 1972, expresses "great delight" with the formation of the SDCC, and conveys the Committee's "best wishes of militant solidarity and friendship." The VCSWAP requests that the SDCC write often and "send us materials you have."

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY:

Indications remain limited of foreign plans or attempts to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed to disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21-23 August 1972. A member of the Swedish Committee for Vietnam, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam, has stated that the U.S. National Elections are playing a role in the Swedish Committee's work. The British-based International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace (ICDP) has distributed a "Spring Offensive Calendar" of activities in the United States against the war based on a submission by the Peoples' Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ). The calendar includes actions planned in connection with the Republican Convention.

DEVELOPMENTS:

I. mid-April 1972, a member of the Swedish Committee for Vietnam, who is also an influential and well-informed staff member of the Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam, stated in a private discussion of the Swedish Committee's unusually heavy work load that "things will be hectic right until the elections in the U.S."

The International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace, a British-based antiwar organization and one of the more prominent member organizations of the Stockholm Conference, has attached a "Spring Offensive Calendar" to the April-May 1972 issue of its regular international publication Vietnam International. The calendar had been furnished by the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and included the following entry:

August 21-23 Republican Convention, San Diego.
Demonstrations organized by the San Diego Convention Coalition, Box 8267, San Diego, Ca. 92103.

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt
or Harass the Republican National Convention

SUMMARY:

The only new indication of foreign plans or efforts
to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed
to disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in
Miami, Florida, 21-23 August 1972, is an expression of
interest by a member of the North Vietnamese Delegation to
the Paris Peace Talks in the plans of the major antiwar
organizations in the United States for demonstrations in
connection with the political conventions of both major
parties.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In mid-May 1972, a member of the North Vietnamese
Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks invited a visitor to
contact him again when the visitor returned from an imminent
trip to the United States. The North Vietnamese official
gave the visitor the New York City addresses of the People's
Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and the National
Peace Action Coalition (NPAC), and asked the visitor to
inquire at their offices regarding their plans for demonstra-
tions during the coming summer. The North Vietnamese
official stated that he was especially interested in plans
for actions in connection with the Democratic and Republican
National Conventions.

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Republican National Convention

## SUMMARY:

New indications of foreign plans or efforts to inspire, support, influence, or exploit activities designed to disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21-24 August 1972, consist of the following: A leader of the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) has stated that demonstrations will be organized to take place at United States and allied military installations abroad during the period immediately before and during the Republican Convention. The PCPJ leader also stated that representatives of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam will participate in activities in connection with the Convention. The Anti-War Union (AWU), a domestic organization which has been active in planning demonstrations in connection with the Republican National Convention, has sent a delegation to Paris, France, to meet with officials of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam (PRG). No information is presently available, however, indicating that actions at the Republican Convention have been discussed at these meetings.

## DEVELOPMENTS:

In an early July 1972 meeting with prominent members of foreign antiwar organizations, a representative of the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ), who occupies an important position within that organization, discussed the plans of the PCPJ in connection with the upcoming election campaign in the United States. The PCPJ representative stated that during the period 14-23 August, a "Peoples Campaign Against Bombing" would be waged in U.S. cities involved in the manufacture and shipping of materials for use in Vietnam, and that similar actions will be organized at United States and allied military installations abroad. The PCPJ representative further stated that "dramatic demonstrations" in protest

of the bombing in Vietnam are being organized by the "Republican Party National Convention Coalition" to occur on 21 August 1972. In an apparent reference to the 21 August actions, the PCPJ leader added that representatives of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam will speak on the subject of the alleged American bombing of dikes in North Vietnam. (Comment: We have no present information concerning plans of Stockholm Conference representatives to travel to the United States during the Republican National Convention; nor do we have any additional information concerning plans of Stockholm Conference representatives to participate in activities connected with the Republican Convention.)

The Anti-War Union (AWU), a domestic group engaged in organizing counter-activities at the Republican National Convention, has sponsored the travel of a delegation of activists to Paris, France, to meet with officials of the Democratic Republic of North Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam (PRG). An advance party has already met with DRV and PRG representatives to discuss the agenda for meetings with the full AWU delegation. Although no information is presently available indicating that actions at the Republican Convention have been discussed or are scheduled to be discussed at meetings between the AWU delegation and the DRV/PRG officials, it is known that members of the AWU advance party have asked for advice from the PRG officials regarding the stance the AWU should take on certain questions relating to the presidential elections. It is also know that the DRV officials have questioned the AWU advance party about the political mood in the United States. One of the AWU delegation. members has stated that upon their return to the United States about 26 July 1972, some of the members will speak at rallies, over the radio, and on television, to "educate the American people about the consequences of voting for Nixon, and the need to end the war and defeat Nixon." The delegation member added that the demonstrations at the Republican Convention will be "unique."

# Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Republican National Convention

2 AUG 1972

## SUMMARY:

There are no new indications of specific foreign plans or efforts to inspire, support, influence, or exploit activities designed to disrupt or harass the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida, 21-24 August 1972. Although meetings have been held recently in Paris, France, between American antiwar activists and representatives of the Democratic Republic of North Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam (PRG), currently available information indicates that the DRV/PRG officials made no efforts to encourage or give guidance to the American participants with respect to the upcoming Republican National Convention. Private discussions, separate from the meetings with the entire American delegation, were conducted by both the DRV and the PRG officials; at present, we have no information regarding the substance of these private exchanges. A second group of activists, considered more important than the first delegation, is scheduled to travel to Paris on or about 1 August 1972 for further consultations with the PRG and DRV representatives.

## DEVELOPMENTS:

In recent meetings in Paris, France, with members of an American delegation sponsored by the Anti-War Union (AWU), representatives of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam (PRG) were very guarded with respect to discussing activities at the Republican National Convention. Although the Vietnamese repeatedly questioned the Americans concerning the mood of the antiwar movement in the United States, they made no direct reference to the Republican Convention, except for one instance when PRG Deputy Chief Nguyen Van TIEN accused President Nixon of using the private and public sessions of the Paris peace talks as "propaganda for the Republican Convention." TIEN then urged the Americans to promote and propagandize the Seven Point Plan offered by the PRG. The Americans, too, for the most part, refrained from discussing the Convention, other than to estimate that demonstrators will number about 10,000 at the Convention.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 158

Following their meeting on 22 July 1972 with the AWU delegation, the PRG officials held additional talks with sub-groups of the delegation. Additionally, at least one of the American participants was invited by the DRV officials to return for further discussions. At present, there is no information available concerning the substance of these private exchanges.

A second, more important delegation of Americans connected with the Anti-War Union is scheduled to travel to Paris circa 1 August 1972 for further consultation with DRV and PRG representatives. This second group is scheduled to be led by Rennie DAVIS, founder and leader of the AWU. This will be DAVIS' second trip to Paris within recent months for discussions with DRV and PRG representatives. Upon his return from his first trip, DAVIS publicly stated that the AWU would demonstrate at both the Democratic and the Republican Convention, but that the AWU's chief target would be the Republican Convention.

# Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt
Or Harass the Democratic National Convention

## SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION:

There are no direct indications thus far of foreign efforts to inspire, support or take advantage of activities designed to disrupt or harass the National Convention of the Democratic Party in Miami, 10-13 July 1972. The concept of coordinated international support for domestic activities in the United States was generally endorsed at the recent World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples of. Indochina; however, the Conference issued no specific call for international support of disruptive actions at the American national political conventions.

## BACKGROUND:

At the Soviet-controlled World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples' of Indochina, held in Versailles from 10-13 February 1972, there was mention of American plans for demonstrations at both the Republican and Democratic National Conventions. The final draft resolution from the conference's "Action Commission" contains an appendix submitted by American delegates whose goal was to secure global coordination for domestic actions in the United States. It calls for international support to six weeks of domestic antiwar actions and demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concludes with the statement: "This campaign will lead up to the Democratic Party Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican Party Convention in. San Diego on August 21, 1972."

The final "Resolution of the Paris World Assembly for the Peace and Independence of the Indochinese People" of 13 February 1972, drafted by the "Political Commission" states:

"In the United States particularly, the protest against the war is voiced more and more strongly,

under various forms, such as draft evasions, desertions, resistance, demonstrations which now affect even the soldiers. The Assembly calls for support to these progressive and antiwar forces in the United States, and asks the governments to grant asylum to deserters and to support their right to repatriation. All together, the peoples of the world will efficiently help to impose on the U.S. Government the restoration of peace, independence and freedom in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

# Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMMARY:

New indications of foreign efforts or plans to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in Miami, 10-15 July 1972, are limited to a reiteration by a member of the Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam of a statement previously issued by the World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina. The Assembly's pronouncement generally endorsed the concept of international support to a campaign of anti-Vietnam War activities in the United States leading up to the Democratic and Republican Conventions, but made no specific call for support of disruptive actions at the conventions themselves.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In early April 1972 an influential and well-informed staff member of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam discussed, in private, the international anti-Vietnam War activities conducted on 1, 15, and 22 April. The Stockholm Conference member stated that these actions were part of an international campaign in support of domestic American antiwar efforts during the period 1 April to 15 May 1972, and "will culminate at the election conventions in July and August."

The World Assembly for Peace and Independence of the Peoples of Indochina, of which the Stockholm Conference was a major organizer, had earlier enunciated a similar statement in an appendix to the final draft resolution of the Assembly's "Action Commission." The appendix called for international support to six weeks of domestic antiwar actions and demonstrations, from 1 April to 15 May 1972, and concluded with "the statement: "This campaign will lead up to the Democratic Party Convention at Miami on July 9, 1972, and the Republican Party Convention in San Diego on August 21, 1972."

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMMARY:

Indications remain limited of foreign plans or attempts to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in Miami, Florida, 10-13 July 1972. A member of the Swedish Committee for Vietnam, who is also a member of the Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam, has stated that the U.S. National Elections are playing a role in the Swedish Committee's work. The British-based International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace (ICDP) has distributed a "Spring Offensive Calendar" of activities in the United States against the war based on a submission by the Peoples' Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ). The calendar includes actions planned in connection with the Democratic Convention.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In mid-April 1972, a member of the Swedish Committee for Vietnam, who is also an influential and well-informed staff member of the Secretariat of the Stockholm Conference on Vietnam, stated in a private discussion of the Swedish Committee's unusually heavy work load that "things will be hectic right until the elections in the U.S."

The International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace, a British-based antiwar organization and one of the more prominent member organizations of the Stockholm Conference, has attached a "Spring Offensive Calendar" to the April-May 1972 issue of its regular international publication Vietnam International. The calendar had been furnished by the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and included the following entry:

July 9 - 12 Democratic Convention, Miami Beach. Demonstrations organised by Florida People's Coalition, Box 17521, Tampa, Florida 33612.

Foreign Support for Activities Planned to Disrupt or Harass the Democratic National Convention

SUMMARY:

The only new indication of foreign plans or efforts to inspire, support, influence, or exploit actions designed to disrupt or harass the Democratic National Convention in Miami, Florida, 10-13 July 1972, is an expression of interest by a member of the North Vietnamese Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks in the plans of the major antiwar organizations in the United States for demonstrations in connection with the political conventions of both major parties.

DEVELOPMENTS:

In mid-May 1972, a member of the North Vietnamese Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks invited a visitor to contact him again when the visitor returned from an imminent trip to the United States. The North Vietnamese official gave the visitor the New York City addresses of the People's Coalition for Peace and Justice (PCPJ) and the National Peace Action Coalition (NPAC), and asked the visitor to inquire at their offices regarding their plans for demonstrations during the coming summer. The North Vietnamese -official stated that he was especially interested in plans for actions in connection with the Democratic and National Conventions.

# MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director/Comptroller

VIA: Acting Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: Agency Support to the U.S. Secret Service (USSS) for National Democratic (10-14 July 1972) and National Republican (21-24 August 1972) Conventions

1. This memorandum is for the information of the Executive Director/Comptroller.

2. Authorization for CIA support to the U.S. Secret Service for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions is contained in a memorandum of 7 April 1972 from Chief, CI Staff to the DCI which was concurred in by the ADDP and approved by the DCI on 10 April 1972 (copy attached).

3. On 13 April 1972 the COS, WH/Miami met with the Miami USSS representative and Mr. Mastrovito of USSS Headquarters to discuss preliminary planning for Station WH/Miami support to the USSS prior to and during subject conventions. On 17 April 1972 the C/WH/COS and C/CI/LSN met with Mr. Mastrovito at Headquarters to implement the preliminary planning agreed upon in Miami and to determine the extent of Headquarters support required by the USSS.

4. The basic agreement mutually concurred in by the USSS and Headquarters representatives provided that:

a. Station WH/Miami would conduct name traces on all Cubans of interest to the USSS.

b. CIA Headquarters would conduct name traces on all other foreign born persons of interest to the USSS.

c. CIA would keep the USSS informed of any events in the Caribbean and Latin American areas that would have any bearing on the USSS protective mission during the convention periods. This would include briefings on Cuba and Cuban policies toward the United States and on activities of Cuban intelligence operations which could affect the security of the conventions.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

# -2-

d. Coverage of Latin American exile groups in the United States would be the responsibility of the FBI since CIA had ceased the extensive coverage formerly targeted against these groups since it was now considered an internal security function.

5. On 27 April 1972 a meeting was held at a buffer office of Station WH/Miami with the USSS Chief of Communications, Station personnel and a Headquarters representative. It was agreed that name traces would be handled by Miami security Field office courier from the USSS to buffer office until the USSS established communications links from their command post in convention center, at which time trace requests would be sent from the command post to USSS headquarters and relayed to CIA Headquarters. Cuban name traces are relayed to Station WH/Miami by the Signal Center and non-Cuban traces are conducted by WH/COG. Replies to USSS requests on non-Cubans are coordinated with CI/SO.

6. Station WH/Miami has arranged the rental of a safehouse about five minutes from convention center which will provide a secure and nearby meeting site for USSS and Agency personnel. This safehouse will be available just prior to and during both conventions. A Headquarters officer will TDY to Miami prior to the conventions and remain until the conventions adjourn to assist the Station in providing the support described in paragraph four above.

7. Station WH/Miami is in daily contact with the USSS in Miami, utilizing buffer office as a meeting site when necessary. The location of Station WH/Miami has not been revealed to the USSS. (Station is located some distance from buffer office.) Additionally, the Miami Security Field Office maintains normal liaison with the local USSS Miami unit.

8. The Station understands that no personnel will be present at the convention hall, that they will not provide any equipment unique to the Agency, nor will it provide the use of any other facilities other than the safehouse described in paragraph six.

SUBJECT: Request for Information on Sensitive Activities

You will recall that in Fiscal Years 1971 and 1972, I believe, Agency funds were made available to the FBI. These funds may still be possibly held in a special account for that use. This is one of the areas where TSD has been very much involved. Chuck Briggs would have the details as this was handled through the Executive Director's office and of course Angleton would have additional information.

MEMORANDUM FOR :
Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT : Areas of Possible Embarrassment to the Agency

1. Sometime in the spring or early summer of 1971, Mr. John Dean levied the requirement on the Agency for information relating to the Investors Overseas Service (IOS). The original request was non-specific but it gradually emerged that Dean was concerned with the possible adverse publicity that might develop regarding the President's nephew, who was employed by IOS.

2. There were multiple channels from the White House to the Agency on this subject:

a. Presumably Haldeman and/or Ehrlichman to Director Helms.

b. Someone (unnamed) in the White House to the DDCI, General Cushman (see attached telephone conversation). Note that Ehrlichman is mentioned, and

c. John Dean to the CI Staff. These various channels were sorted out in time and six reports were passed by the CI Staff to Mr. Fred Fielding for Mr. John Dean.

3. The telephone call of General Cushman's is of interest since it gives the flavor of White House concern. It took several days to uncover the fact that the White House interest centered on the involvement of the President's nephew with IOS and possible adverse publicity. The reports submitted to Dean's office were routine in nature and were coordinated with the DCI. After a few months, interest in this subject died down and we did not pursue it further.

4. Please return the attachments when they have served your purpose.

5. I also include a short note on the Intelligence Evaluation Committee and Staff prepared by Richard Ober. The original meetings were held in the office of John Dean at the White House and the principal sparkplug for this group activity was the then Assistant Attorney General for Internal Security, Robert Mardian and then later his assistant, William Olsen. It is noted that Mr. Mardian is now appearing before the Grand Jury and it is always possible that he might draw in the Agency.

6. Before appointing Ober to the IES Staff as the Agency representative, I had attended various inter-agency meetings pre- sided over by Mardian. I expressed the view to Director Helms that Mardian would require very careful handling due to his inexperience. Furthermore, Mardian was deeply involved in the split between Bill Sullivan and Mr. Hoover. On a confidential basis one or two senior FBI officials stated that Sullivan was secretly passing files to Mardian without Mr. Hoover's permission. This was one of the important reasons why Sullivan was dismissed from the Bureau.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Counter Intelligence Staff, Police Group Activities

1. Counter Intelligence Staff, Police Group (CI/PG) is responsible for Staff coordination within the Office of the Deputy Director for Operations for activities and programs involving assistance to foreign police/security forces for the purpose of exploiting such activities and programs for intelligence purposes.

2. CI/PG maintains liaison with the Office of Public Safety, Arency for International Reveionont (SP3/) and its training facility, the International Police Academy (IPA). CI/PC also administers and supervises Project IDEN-171- and its training proprietary facility, IDEN-172. In addition, CI/PG coordinates a joint CPS/ATD Technical Services Division, Central Intelligence Agency (TSM/CIN) Technical Investigations Course. CI/PG provides guidance and counsel to the Area Divisions in matters pertaining to molice/security functions and activities. Specific details of these functions are as follows:

LIAISON WITH OPS/AID

CI/PG liaison with OPS/AID and IPA is conducted on a daily basis and consists principally of:

A. exchange of information on IPA participants, some of whom later attend IDEN-172 courses and who are of interest to Agency components,

B. arranging for inclusion of Agency sponsored participants in IPA/CPS/AIDS training prograns,

C. arranging for IPA/OPS/MID briefings and tours for foreign police/security representatives sponsored by CIA Area Divisions,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

D. obtaining biographic and assessment data.on IPA/OPS/AID trainces,.

E. providing general information pertaining to police/security organizations, activities, equipment, and personalities requested by Agency operating components,

F. coordinating the Agency's participation in the Technical Investigations Course designed to familiarize the trainees with the technique required to properly investigate terrorist activities wherein explosives have been utilized,

G. obtaining OPS/AID cover for CIA personnel to serve abroad. At one time as many as 50 CIA employees were covered in Latin America, the Far East and Africa. This total has been reduced during the past several years to 10 serving in Thailand, *

H. arranging contact between Desk officers and OPS/AID sponsored participants.

PROJECT IDEN-171 - PROPRIETARY IDEN-172- training function of IDEN-168

IDEN-172 Training Academy is a commercial interprise. It was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland in 1952 and conducts its business in the District of Colombia. It is engaged principally in training foreign police/security personnel under an overt contract with OPS/AID, and selling police/security equipment to foreign police/security ty personnel and organizations.IDEN-172 also provides special training programs and briefings to foreign police/security personnel of interest to Agency operating divisions. It provides biographic and assessment data on trainces to country desks. PecentlyIDEN-172 has acquired the capability of providing training to foreign policc/security personnel in VIP protective security for Chiefs of State.

* CIA personnel under this cover will not be replaced as such and all will be phased out by June 1974.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 176

### COMMENT

CI/PG does not maintain direct contact or liaison with any law enforcement organization, local or federal, at home or abroad. When the need arises, such contact is sometimes made on our behalf by OPS/AID or DEN-172 without divulging Agency interest. OPS/AID has such contacts at home and abroad because of the nature of its activities (training of foreign police/security personnel at home and abroad), and its Public Safety programs around the world. IDEN-172 has such contacts at home - local and federal level - because its personnel are personally acquainted with law enforcement officers throughout the United States. Members of the [DEN-172 staff (not identified) as CIA) have appeared as guest lecturers at such federal institutions as the U.S. Park Police, IPA, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. Treasury Enforcement Division.

3. In addition to the liaison mentioned in the previous paragraph, the Agency maintains liaison in varying degrees with foreign police/security organizations through its field stations. The existence and extent thereof, however, is a decision to be made by the Area Division, and is not the responsibility of CI/PG.

4. The CIA station as a member of the Country Team in Montevideo, Uruguay, may have had some contact with Jan Mitrione, who was murdered by the Tupanaros. Dan Citrione, an experienced and respected law enforcement officer, was a bona fide OPS/AID officer assigned to the AID mission in Uruguay, and was never a CIA employee or agent.

SUBJECT: The MHCHAOS Program

1.  The MHCHAOS program is a worldwide program for clandestine collection abroad of information on foreign efforts to support/encourage/exploit/manipulate domestic U.S. extremism, especially by Cuba, Communist China, North Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Korea and the Arab fedayeen.

2.  The MHCHAOS program has not and is not conduct- ing efforts domestically for internal domestic collection purposes. Agency efforts are foreign. Foreign-oriented activity in the United States has been of two types:

a. Selected FBI domestic sources who travel abroad in connection with their extremist activity and/or affiliations to make contact with hostile foreign powers or with foreign extremist groups have been briefed and debriefed by Headquarters officers. The briefing has included appropriate operational guidance, including defensive advice.

> [Figure: a partial image of handwritten note]

b. Americans with existing extremist creden- tials have been assessed, recruited, tested and dispatched abroad for PCS assignments as contract agents, primarily sources offered for such use by the FBI. When abroad they collect information re- sponsive to MHCHAOS program requirements, as well as other Agency requirements. They are thus used primarily for targeting against Cubans, Chinese Com- munists, the North Vietnamese, etc., as their back- ground and their particular access permits. It should be noted that the MPTROIKA aspect of the MPLODESTAR project of the East Asia Division is similar to the MHCHAOS PROGRAM.

3.  As indicated earlier, MHCHAOS is a foreign program, conducted overseas, except for the limited activity described above. The program is and has been managed so as to achieve the maximum feasible utilization of existing resources of the Operations Directorate. No assets

have been recuited and run exclusively for the MHCHAOS
program. Instead, emphasis has been placed on the exploi-
tation of new and old Agency assets who have a by-product
capability or a concurrent capability for provision of
information responsive to the program's requirements.
This has involved the provision of custom-tailored collec-
tion requirements and operational guidance. This collec-
tion program is viewed as an integral part of the recruit-
ment and collection programs of China Operations, Vietnam
Operations, Cuban Operations, Soviet Bloc Division opera-
tions and Korean Branch operations. Agents who have an
American "Movement" background or who have known connec-
tions with the American "Movement" are useful as access
agents to obtain biographic and personality data, to dis-
cern possible vulnerabilities and susceptibilities, and
to develop operationally exploitable relationships with
recruitment targets of the above programs. These assets
are of interest to our targets because of their connec-
tions with and/or knowledge of the American "Movement."
Over the course of the MHCHAOS program, there have been
approximately 20 important areas of operational interest,
which at the present time have been reduced to about ten:
Paris, Stockholm, Brussels, Dar Es Salaam, Conakry, Algiers,
Mexico City, Santiago, Ottawa and Hong Kong.

4. The MICHAOS program also utilizes audio opera-
   tions, two of which have been implemented to cover tar-
   gets of special interest.

Paragraph a. deleted because it reveals a sensitive
foreign operation.

Paragraph b. deleted because it reveals a sensitive

5. MHCHAOS reporting from abroad relating to the program originates in two ways: Individuals who are noted in contact with Cubans, the Chinese Communists, etc., and who appear to have extremist connections, interests or background are reported upon. Other individuals are reported upon in response to specific Headquarters requirements received from the FBI because such individuals, are of active investigatory security interest to the FBI.

6. All cable and dispatch traffic related to the MHCHAOS program is sent via restricted channels. It is not processed by either the Cable Secretariat or the Information Services Division. The control and retriev- ability of information obtained, including information received from the FBI, is the responsibility of the Special Operations Group.

7. Information responsive to specific FBI requirements is disseminated to the FBI via special controlled dissemination channels, i.c., by restricted handling cable traffic or via special pouch and specially numbered blind memoranda.

8. Information of particular significance, when collected, has been disseminated by special memorandum over the signature of the Director of Central Intelligence to the White House (Dr. Kissinger and John Dean), as well as to the Attorney General, the Secretary of State and the Director of the FBI.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Foreign Resources Division Operational Activities with Possible Flap Potential

1. At thr risk of stating the obvious, almost all of the operational activities carried on by FR Division in the United States run the risk that unauthorized disclosure could create embarrassment to the Agency. We have accepted this as a condition precedent and have proceeded with our operational activities in the most professional manner possible under the circumstances. There are certain rather unusual activities in which FR Division has participated and/or is participating that contain some-what greater possibility for embarrassment if discovered. I have listed these below, not necessarily in order of embarrassment potential:

a. The New York Base provides a fairly considerable amount of support to Dr. Kissinger in his contacts with the Chinese. This support was authorized by Mr. Karamessines and Mr. Helms. Thus far there has been no problem other than the inordinate amount of time spent by New York Base personnel, not to mention the fairly sizeable amount of money that has been expended in support of these efforts.

b. A CIA Officer is to be assigned to FR Division. The CIA Officer is presently assigned overseas under deep cover; his cover is the Mullen Corporation. This is the cor-poration that employed E. Howard Hunt. In discussions between NOCAD and the ADDO, it was decided that the Officer would be pulled out and reassigned in the United States. FR Division was directed to accept this officer for assignment.

We have concluded that the best solution is to have this officer attend a university in the Midwest for at least a year, working towards an advanced degree until there has been time for the situation to clarify itself. We plan to make no operational use of the CIA Officer whatsoever, during the period of time that he is attending the university. Upon completion of his year's study, we will review the situation and decide the next course of action at that time.

Paragraph 1. c. is deleted because it contains sensitive Agency operational methods and techniques.

d. FR Division has been briefed in general on the existence of an audio operation done by the FBI but with close TSD support in San Francisco. This operation is directed against IDEN-62. I understand the operation has been exceptionally well done. However, the responsibility for this activity has come from Chief, TSD in conjunction with SB Division.

e. Three microphones were planted in various locations in the IDEN-61 by the FBI. The equipment was produced by CLA and the overall operation was joint, although no CIA personnel have entered the premises. The operation was deactivated and is presently dormant. The mikes, however, are still in place. If discovered the operation could cause some embarrassment to the American Government, but it is unlikely the finger would point to CIA.

VIII. Coordination

A. Internal

In developing its cadre of general support assets and access agents, the FR Division maintains close contact with the Domestic Contact Service of the Directorate for Intelligence, using their assets wherever and whenever possible to support FR's operational activities. To a more limited degree, FR Bases maintain contacts with Office of Security and Office of Personnel field representatives, pursuing the occasional leads surfaced by these officers and using their entre to specific individuals who can provide access to targets of operational interest.

B. External

FR officers in the field maintain coordination with their FBI counterparts. There is limited cooperation with Bureau offices on internal security cases involving Soviet and Bloc officials and the local FBI offices are of occasional help in operations involving other nationals. The local field offices of the FBI are made aware of the presence of FR officers in their jurisdictions and have on occasion provided backstopping on cases where there was some flap potential.

Coordination with the FBI of FR Division's agent recruitment activity is governed by an agreement between the Agency and the FBI dated 7 February 1966.

The Bases also have contact with local Immigration and Naturalization Service offices although these contacts are less frequent and less important than the contacts with the FBI offices.

Reference is made to the letter to the Attorney General dated May 28, 1975, and signed by Senator Frank Church and Senator John C. Tower.

A review of the central files of the FBI revealed that a file pertaining to your application for employment with the Department of Justice and a file which lists you as the victim in a case involving the Congressional Assassination Statute are maintained by this Bureau.

Enclosed herewith are pertinent documents from the Departmental Applicant file. Certain data in this file is exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the provisions of Title 5, United States Code, Section 552 (b) (2), (b) (5), and (b) (7) (C) and (D). As I am sure you are aware, these exemptions allow for the withholding of information related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency; inter- agency or intra-agency documents not available through discovery proceedings during litigation; information which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of another individual; and information which would disclose the identity of a confidential source.

The other file pertains to an investigation concerning a threat against your life. Although your name is carried in the title throughout the file as the "victim," only a minimal amount of information refers to you. The file indicates that the Denver Police Department received information that a particular individual was in Denver to kill you if you were elected as United States Senator from Colorado on November 5, 1974; that the polls indicated you would be elected; that you and your Denver Office were aware of this threat; that the Denver Police Department afforded protection for you until you departed Denver the morning of November 6, 1974, for vacation in Mexico; and that an Agent of this Bureau attempted to see you to display a photograph of the suspect, but was advised by your assistant that the Denver Police Department had

displayed the photograph to you and you did not recognize the suspect. For your information this is no longer an active investigation as the unknown subject was not identified and the original allegation was not corroborated. Other than the reasonably segregable portion of the references to you as set forth above, this file is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, Title 5, United States Code, Section 552 (b) (2), (b) (5) and (b) (7) (C) and (D).

Also, our records contain two documents from the United States Department of Justice concerning you which have been referred to the Attorney General.

If you wish to have any of the material reconsidered, it would be appropriate to discuss this matter with the Attorney General.

Senator Huddleston is identical with subject of Bufiles 166-5980, 94-67291, and 94-1-676-300. Huddleston was contacted by Bureau liaison to offer any assistance to the newly elected Senator, which is standard Bureau policy. Huddleston's Executive Assistant called the Congressional Service Office on 1/9/75, and requested a speaker from the FBI to address the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce Convention. Speaker granted. Huddleston was alleged to have taken a bribe of $15,000 while he was a State Senator in Kentucky. Several persons approached him to find out if they could establish a bank charter. His supposed reply was that this could be accomplished for a certain amount of money. The bank charter was eventually established and one of the individuals who originally approached him, hand-carried the $15,000 in cash to him at his office. On 9/5/73, the Department advised the FBI that it desired no more invest- igation in this case at that time. Senator Huddleston was never interviewed regarding this matter. Excised documents taken from 94-67291-3,2,1; 94-1-676-300; and 166-5980-9,7,5,4, and 1.

# Memorandum

TO : MR. CALLAHAN DATE: 7/24/75

FROM : J. B. ADAMS

SUBJECT: REQUEST BY VARIOUS SENATORS ON
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO REVIEW
THEIR FBI FILES

At the meeting between Mr. Kelley and the Attorney General, along with their respective staffs on 7/21/75, the Attorney General determined that there should be broad disclosure of material in the files of those Senators on the Senate Select Committee requesting access to same and that in the main the Bureau should only restrict access to revelation of live informants or information which would reveal the identity of live informants. In addition, he indicated that in his review of the file on Senator Hart he noted certain derogatory information on relatives which he felt Senator Hart should not see. Also, there may be criminal investigations against one of the Senators of such a nature that revelation should be restricted.

It was agreed that Deputy Assistant Attorney General O'Connor and I should review the files in order to determine problem areas and Mr. O'Connor would consult with Judge Tyler as needed.

Files have been reviewed and there is general agreement that almost all of the information can be revealed with certain limited excisions taking care of problem areas. Mr. O'Connor advised-on-7/24/75 that he has been in touch with the Committee and they will make arrangements to come to my office and review their fires along with Mr. O'Connor. Senator Goldwater has added his name to the list and Mr. McDermott has been advised in order to insure all pertinent material is accumulated.

Mr. Thomas V. Glynn
Assistant to the Commissioner
Internal Revenue Service
Washington, D.C. 20224

Dear Tom:

We would appreciate your advising the Select
Committee of the following regarding possible IRS
participation in or furnishing information to the Intelli-
gence Evaluation Committee: 1) whether the IRS had a
representative on the IEC and, if so, who; 2) if there
was such a representative, what duties he had; 3) what
information, if any, IRS furnished to IEC. We request
that the IRS identify for inspection and copying by the
Select Committee staff all documents relating to or
constituting information furnished by IRS either
directly to IEC or furnished to persons in the Treasury
Department or elsewhere which was ultimately provided to
IEC.

The Committee has reason to believe that at a
March 26, 1971, meeting of the IEC, Mr. Eugene T. Rossides,
then Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Treasury,
Enforcement and Operations Division, was introduced to the
IEC as the person responsible for, inter alia, intelligence
gathering by IRS, and that he would be called upon to make
contributions from that source to the Committee's work.

Essentially, the Committee requests that the IRS
come forward with all information it has regarding direct
or indirect IRS participation in the work of the IEC.

# FBI INFORMATION-GATHERING PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

There is a total of more than 6,500,000 files at FBI Headquarters. Most of these contain information gathered during investigation of matters--including some 100 types of criminal, security, and applicant-employee cases--assigned to the FBI by laws of Congress, directives of the President, and orders of the Attorney General.

The remainder of these more than 6,500,000 files include:

(1) Personnel files regarding FBI applicants.and employees;

(2) General files regarding FBI contacts and dealings with a variety of individuals and organizations concerning matters that do not require or involve FBI investigation; and

(3) Administrative-type files, such as those of a policy nature, those containing statistical reports, those detailing FBI cooperative services, and the like.

An unknown, but extremely small, percentage of these more than 6,500,000 FBI files contain information regarding present or former Congressmen and Senators which may have been accumulated prior to, during, or after their tenure in Congress.

WHAT FBI FILES CONTAIN ON CONGRESSMEN:

FBI Files contain substantially the same types of information regarding Senators and Congressmen as is contained in them about other citizens. Basically this information falls into the following categories:

Violations of Law

(1) Allegations that Congressmen or Senators have violated Federal laws within the FBI's jurisdiction.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

The FBI investigates such allegations whether they relate to Members of Congress or any other person. The results of these investigations are furnished to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecutive officials of the Department of Justice. The investigation may establish (a) that the Congressman or Senator has, in fact, violated a Federal law, (b) that a Federal law has been violated, but that the involvement of the Congressman or Senator in that violation cannot be established, (c) that a Federal law has been violated, but that the Congressman or Senator clearly had no involvement in its violation, or (d) that no violation of Federal law was committed.

Included among such allegations involving Congressmen and Senators have been the following types of violations within the FBI's jurisdiction: Bank Fraud and Embezzlement; Conflict of Interest; Conspiracy to Obstruct Justice; Election Laws; Fraud Against the Government; and Interstate Transportation in Aid of Racketeering.

(2) Violations of Federal laws within the FBI'S jurisdiction involving Congressmen and Senators as victims.

The results of FBI investigations of such violations are furnished to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecutive officials of the Department of Justice. In many instances, the original complaint in these cases is received from the lawmaker-victim himself; however, if the information originates elsewhere, the FBI promptly notifies the Congressman or Senator involved of the threat which has been made. In addition; other law enforcement agencies which have a legitimate interest in these cases are notified of the threat.

Violations of the Congressional Assassination, Kidnaping and Assault Statute, Bomb Threats, and Extortion are among the crimes within the FBI's jurisdiction which have involved lawmakers as victims.

(3) Allegations that members of the staffs of Congressmen or Senators have violated Federal laws within the FBI's jurisdiction, or that these staff members have been victims of such violations.

The FBI investigates such allegations and furnishes the results to United States Attorneys and/or other prosecutive officials of the Department of Justice. Where appropriate, the Congressman or Senator involved is also advised of the investigation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 210

Congressmen and Senators may be interviewed by the FBI in these cases involving Congressional aides--just as they may be interviewed in connection with other types of FBI investigations--and both the fact of, and the results of, such interviews are noted in the file reflecting the FBI investigation.

(4) Allegations that Senators or Congressmen have violated laws within the jurisdiction of other investigative agencies.

These allegations are brought to the attention of the agency concerned--Federal, state, or local. Such allegations are not investigated by the FBI. However, the cooperative services of the FBI Laboratory, Identification Division, and National Crime Information Center are available to other law enforcement agencies in the investigation of these, as well as other, crimes.

Applicant Investigations

(5) Present and former Congressmen and Senators often are considered for positions in the Executive or Judicial Branches of the Federal Government which require that the FBI conduct a thorough background investigation of them.

Dependent, upon the nature of the position involved, the results of these investigations are furnished to the White House, the Department of Justice, and/or other appropriate Government agencies.

(6) Congressmen and Senators often are interviewed in the course of applicant-type investigations regarding other persons who are being considered for Executive or Judicial positions--as well as during applicant-type investigations conducted by the FBI (at the request of the Committee chairman involved) concerning staff members of a limited number of House and Senate Committees. Both the fact of, and the results of, the interview of the Congressman or Senator are noted in the file reflecting the FBI's investigation.

Security Cases

(7) Either prior to, during, or subsequent to their tenure in Congress, there may be files pertaining to security- type matters which relate to members of the House and Senate, or Congressmen may be identified in FBI files as actual or intended victims of acts by subjects of security-type cases.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 211

The Statutes covering such matters are Title 18, Section 2383 (Rebellion and Insurrection), Title 18, Section 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy), and Title 18, Section 2385 (Smith Act - Advocating overthrow of Government by force).

Oral or Written Contact

(8) An unknown number of FBI files contain copies of correspondence between the FBI and Congressmen and Senators concerning a wide variety of matters which include bills pending in, or passed by, Congress; personnel matters; the Bureau's cooperative services; and FBI policies, procedures, and investigations. Many of these letters from Congressmen and Senators have been prompted by inquiries which these lawmakers have received from constituents or other interested citizens.

The FBI's files also contain memoranda regarding telephone calls and personal contacts the FBI has had with Congressmen and Senators regarding the above-cited variety of matters.

Miscellaneous Information About Congressmen

(9) An unknown number of FBI files contain information reflecting favorably or unfavorably upon the character, integrity, and loyalty of Senators and Congressmen--which information does not require investigative action at the time received on the part of the FBI or other law enforcement agencies. It consists of:

(a) Information contained in unsolicited letters received by the FBI from persons and organizations representing a variety of backgrounds, viewpoints, and walks of life.

(b) Information volunteered orally to FBI Agents by the same broad range of individuals and organizations as cited directly above.

(c) Newspaper clippings, as well as data from magazines and other news dissemination media.

(d) Miscellaneous information received from FBI confidential informants and/or other sensitive sources.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 212

# Fingerprints of Congressmen

(10) The files of the Identification Division contain the fingerprints of an unknown number of Senators and Congressmen. Some of these relate to their having been arrested for violations of Federal, state, or local laws. Others are noncriminal in origin and largely pertain to their having served in the Armed Forces or having been applicants for various positions. These fingerprint cards have been submitted to the FBI by Federal agencies, as well as by local, county, and state criminal justice agencies, throughout the United States.

Fingerprint records are maintained by the FBI's Identification Division, and they are kept entirely separate and apart from all other files and records of the FBI.

## HOW INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN REACHES FBI FILES:

There are two basic types of information regarding Congressmen and Senators in FBI files:

(1) Information which the FBI has solicited during investigations involving the Congressman or Senator as either a subject or a victim. This includes information of pertinence to the case which the lawmaker himself has furnished to the FBI.

(2) Unsolicited Information.

There are many sources of the unsolicited information that is included in FBI files:

(a) It is volunteered by citizens who are being interviewed during investigations of matters having no relationship to any of our Nation's lawmakers.

(b) It is volunteered in communications sent to the FBI by individuals and organizations.

(c) It is included in news articles and other reports publicly disseminated by our Nation's news media which come to the FBI's attention.

(d) It is received from FBI confidential informants and, very infrequently, from telephone taps not directed at a Congressman which have been installed with authority of a Federal Court and/or authority of the Attorney General.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 213

(e) In the case of information contained on fingerprint cards, it is sent to the FBI's Identification Division by authorized contributors, including criminal justice agencies throughout the United States.

## HOW AND WHERE INFORMATION ABOUT CONGRESSMEN IS MAINTAINED:

Information regarding Congressmen and Senators is included in the official FBI files--totaling more than 6,500,000 in number--that are maintained by the Files and Communications Division on an upper floor of the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building.

The area where these files are maintained is staffed and supervised 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assure continuous security.

### General Index

The essential key to the effective use of these FBI files is the Bureau's General Index which consists of 58 million index cards and which is located on a different floor from the files themselves in the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building. To determine what files (if any at all) contain information regarding an individual Senator or Congressman, it is necessary to search the name of that lawmaker in the General Index.

The General Index is staffed and supervised 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assure continuous security.

### Rules Governing Use of Files

These official FBI files are available only to FBI personnel--and they are available on a "need-to-know" basis only.

The Files and Communications Division maintains a record of files that have been charged out by Headquarters personnel. Such files must be returned to the Files and Communications Division as soon as possible; and during the period that a file is charged out, it cannot be left even momentarily in an unlocked room. If retained overnight, the file must be kept in a locked cabinet inside a locked room.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 214

The charge-out record is temporary in nature and
is destroyed five days after the file has been returned to
the Files and Communications Division.

## WHY THE FBI RETAINS INFORMATION REGARDING CONGRESSMEN:

The information regarding Congressmen and Senators
that is maintained in FBI files can be divided into three
major categories:

(1) The results of investigations (criminal-,
security-, and applicant-type) involving a Congressman or
Senator as a subject or victim;

(2) Information regarding a Congressman or Senator--
in addition to that gathered during investigation(s) of the
lawmaker involved--which the FBI has disseminated to other
Federal agencies (such as to the Internal Revenue Service if, for
example, the information involves a tax-related matter) and/or to
state and local law enforcement agencies (such as the police
department covering the lawmaker's home community if, for example,
the information involves an alleged threat against the lawmaker's
house or other property); and

(3) Other information that the FBI receives from,
or receives about, a Congressman or Senator that is included
in the FBI's files--without having been either investigated
or disseminated by the FBI.

The reasons this information is retained in FBI
files can be explained in legal and administrative terms,
as well as in practical terms.

## Legal and Administrative Reasons

All investigative files and other records of the
FBI involving Congressmen or Senators are within a class
of records which--under the FBI Records Retention Plan
developed in 1969 by the National Archives and Records
Service of the General Services Administration-are con-
sidered of enduring archival value to ensure their preser-
vation.

This FBI Records Retention Plan was prepared under
the authority contained in the Federal Records Act of 1950,
which is contained in Title 44 of the United States Code.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 215

Included among the FBI records to be retained
under the Records Retention Plan formulated by the National
Archives and Records Service are those which would have
historical value and would document policies, procedures,
functions, legislative and budget matters, and the like--
and reports of investigations of both civil and criminal
activities, including "crimes involving, and other records,
concerning, the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the
United States, members of and delegates elected to the
Congresses of the United States, cabinet heads, judges and
other officials appointed by the President."

In establishing the FBI Records Retention Plan,
the National Archives and Records Service noted, "Ordinarily
the records of a Federal agency that are worthy of permanent
retention amount to a rather small percentage of the total
volume of records generated. Many of the records produced
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, however, relate to
a number of controversial if not important aspects of the
history of the United States, particularly to the role of
the Federal Government in its relation to its citizens.
To be sure, many years will pass before these records can
be made available to the public for historical and other
sėrious research. Nevertheless, the archival value of these
records will not decrease nor will interest in them dissipate."

In addition, the FBI is also required by the
Federal Records Act to make records containing adequate and
proper documentation of its administration and operations
which, among other things, are designed to furnish informa-
tion necessary to protect the legal and financial interest
of the Government and of persons directly affected by FBI
activities.

## Practical Reasons for Retaining Information

Logic, reason, and lessons learned from more than
six decades of law enforcement experience dictate that the
FBI should maintain records of investigations it has conducted
(category #1 cited at the top of page 7) and records of
information it has disseminated to other agencies (category #2
on page 7).

Such records enable the FBI to answer questions or
challenges (including those arising in judicial or administra-
tive proceedinus) involving investigations FBI Agents have
conducted and/or information the FBI has disseminated to other


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 216

agencies. Such records also enable the FBI to furnish additional copies of investigative reports or other information that has been disseminated--should additional copies be needed by the original recipients or by other official agencies. Furthermore, the information contained in these files often proves of assistance in future investigations.

Less obvious may be the reasons why the FBI retains the third category of information about Congressmen and Senators (data that has neither been investigated nor disseminated by the FBI) cited on page 7.

If such information is of an administrative nature--that is, if the information indicates the lawmaker is interested in a specific FBI investigation, a specific area of the FBI's jurisdiction, or specific FBI policies, practices and procedures--it is filed for:

(1) the information and advice of FBI employees in connection with future contacts or correspondence with that Congressman or Senator;

(2) consideration of FBI personnel in connection with possible future changes in FBI policies, practices, and procedures.

If the information is of a personal nature--that is, if it reflects upon the loyalty, character, or integrity of a lawmaker--it is included in FBI files for the following reasons:

(1) The information may prove of value when a present or former Congressman or Senator is considered for a position in the Executive or Judicial Branch of Government which requires that the FBI conduct a background investigation of him.

(2) The information could prove of value in solving future crimes committed against the Congressman or Senator--or against members of that lawmaker's family. (A person who berates and defames a lawmaker would be a logical suspect if that lawmaker--or another Congressman or Senator whose views coincide with his--becomes the target of actual or threatened violence.)

(3) The information could aid the FBI in solving crimes committed against other persons. (For example, the handwriting, typewriting, stationery, and/or distinctive

- 9 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 217

phraseology in a letter defaming a Congressman could assist
the FBI in linking the writer of that letter to a subsequent
extortion note or written bomb threat that does not involve
any member of Congress.)

(4) The information frequently provides valuable.
insight into the character, stability, and reliability of
the person who has furnished it to the FBI. Thereby, it is
of value and assistance to the FBI in future contacts with,
contacts by, or inquiries regarding, this individual.

(5) The information provides a useful administra-
tive check on the performance of FBI field offices--
particularly with regard to the important consideration of
whether they are being fully responsive to the public needs.
Supervisory personnel regularly review complaints or
allegations received from the public to insure that the
appropriate action was taken--if, in fact, action was called
for.

### WHAT IS REQUIRED TO DESTROY FILE INFORMATION:

Barring a new law of Congress and/or receipt of a
revised FBI Records Retention Plan from the National Archives
and Records Service, the FBI cannot unilaterally undertake
the destruction of information regarding Congressmen and
Senators in its files.

This memorandum recommends that the Director raise the question of privacy and source protection with Senators of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) on the occasion of his anticipated meeting in Executive Session with the SSC tentatively scheduled for the week of 7/14/75.

By letter dated 7/9/75, Senators Frank Church and John Tower of SSC requested the Attorney General and the Director to appear before the Committee in Executive Session during the week of 7/14/75. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the matter of concern to Mr. Kelley and steps which might be taken to expedite the response to requests for documents essential to the Committee inquiry.

The Senstudy staff of the Intelligence Division is preparing for the Director's use copies of each of the written requests received from SSC annotated with the dates of our response to each request; the date it was delivered to the Department; and the date it was delivered to the SSC staff.

There remains, however, a serious problem precipitated by three recent written requests of the SSC dated 6/30/75 (received by the Bureau on 7/7/75); 7/1/75 (received by the Bureau on 7/8/75); and 7/8/75 (received by the FBI on 7/9/75). All three of these requests appear, in part, to disregard the privacy of certain individuals or requests the identity of sources cooperating with the FBI.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY '75

In this regard, in an exchange of letters dated 3/11 and 12/75, William Colby in his role as the Director of Central Intelligence, wrote to Senator Church stating that "I am particularly appreciative of your recognition that certain sensitive aspects of our intelligence activities must receive special consideration and treatment by the Select Committee in the course of your work. As we discussed, such matters as the identities of our sensitive sources . . . should be protected not only from exposure, but indeed from the risk of exposure. We should also work together to protect certain other information which, if improperly disclosed, might impair the privacy rights of the individuals."

By letter dated 3/12/75, Senator Church stated as follows, "It is the Committee's understanding that the members of the Committee and designated staff will have access to any or all information which the Committee deems necessary for its inquiry. We recognize, however, that the Committee inquiry may touch on sensitive areas, such as the identities of CIA personnel, sources, or cooperating organizations whose disclosure could place persons in actual jeopardy. In the event that the Committee inquiry touches on such sensitive areas, which matters we have already discussed in our meeting of February 27, we should discuss jointly, and as you suggested quickly, what procedures might be followed should the Committee decide it requires more information in these specific areas."

The 6/30/75 SSC letter requests among other things, a list of all police departments and personnel contacted relative to a particular COINTELPRO operation; a list of all media persons contacted in relation to this COINTELPRO and the media affiliation.

The 7/1/75 SSC letter requests a list of all persons outside the FBI (including, but not limited to, employees' relatives, friendly media personnel, members of clergy, federal, state and local law enforcement and other officials) contacted in relation to four persons who were subjects of

RE: SENSTUDY '75

COINTELPRO operations. This same letter also notes that one Morris Starsky, one of the four persons referred to above, was made known to the FBI during a conference on 6/12/75, as a person who would be the subject of a case study by the SSC. This is not so. Inquiry was made of those Bureau supervisors who attended the conference and a review of the memorandum written following the conference was made. Neither the memorandum nor the recollection of Bureau supervisors attending the conference indicates the name Morris Starsky was mentioned by SSC staff personnel.

The 7/8/75 SSC letter requests among other things:
(1) all memoranda and other materials which relate to a meeting between the President and Roy Wilkins, A. Philip Randolph, Whitney Young, Mrs. Dorothy Haight, James Farmer and Jack Greenberg on 11/19/64; (2) a copy of a November, 1964, telegram from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to Director Hoover and all notes, memoranda, and any other materials reflecting the disposition of, or actions taken as a result of the receipt of, said telegram; (3) all memoranda and other materials which relate to a meeting between the President and Dr. King on 2/9/65; (4) all other materials which relate to the transfer of former Special Agent Robert C. Nichols to the Oklahoma Office of the FBI in June, 1969; (5) all forms and attachments including forms entitled "Performance Rating Guide For Investigative Personnel," from 1959 until retirement for former Special Agents Robert C. Nichols and Alan Sentinella.

OBSERVATION:

It would appear the above-cited requests do, in fact, violate the privacy of individuals and possibly place in jeopardy the identity of persons who cooperated with the FBI. Consistent with the agreement in the exchange of letters between Colby and Church dated 3/11 and 12/75, it is believed the Director should raise these questions with the SSC and attempt to get relief from the requirement of revealing the names of FBI sources or violating the privacy of individuals. Certainly the request for information on former Special Agents Nichols and Sentinella goes to the heart of the privacy issue and appears to be a blatant disregard for their privacy.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. Cleveland

FROM : R. J. McCarthy

DATE: July 21, 1975

SUBJECT: UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
TO STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Reference is made to the Attorney General's letter, July 16, 1975, captioned as above, requesting information relating to the collection, analysis, use, and dissemination of organized crime intelligence.

On June 25, 1974, the Director testified before the FBI Oversight Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Bureau has "no statutory authority to collect intelligence per se" but that it operates under the general umbrella of 28 U.S.C. 533 (3), which authorizes the Attorney General to appoint officials "to conduct...investigations regarding official matters...as may be directed by the Attorney General." A listing of any directives issued by the Department or the Attorney General with respect to organized crime should be available in the office of the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice.

With respect to the FBI, all our investigations in the organized crime field are aimed at one ultimate objective: prosecution.

During the course of our investigation of individual hoodlums and the various criminal syndicates operating throughout the United States, we naturally acquire considerable data regarding the structure of the organized underworld, the identities of its principal leaders, the extent of its influence, its primary sources of income, its payoffs to corrupt officials, and the operations of its vast communications-networks.

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland
Re: United States Senate Select Committee
To Study Governmental Operations With
Respect to Intelligence Activities

Most of this information is obtained from paid
informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert
citizens, and from court-approved electronic surveillances
installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

None of it, however, is intelligence for intelligence's
sake. The experience of the FBI over the years has shown that
criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting
illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may
reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these
activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized
underworld are not aimed at developing general nonspecific
data but at establishing which criminal violations its members
are engaged in and then proving these violations in a court
of law.

Obviously, not every case opened, every lead followed,
or every bit of information received is going to wind up in
Federal court. On the contrary, much of this material relates
to offenses outside the investigative jurisdiction of the
FBI. When such is the case, we immediately disseminate the
information to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agency.
As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past
five years alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make
more than 17,000 organized crime arrests; confiscate over
$151,000,000 worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, $9,000,000
worth of cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia,
and $6,000,000 worth of counterfeit bills; and assess tax
liens against $19,000,000 worth of property arising out of
Federal gambling cases.

In addition, a considerable portion of the organized
crime intelligence information developed by the FBI is for-
warded to the various Federal Strike Forces coordinating
racket investigations throughout the country and to the
Criminal Division of the Department, which has entered this
information in its computerized data bank called "Racketeer
Profile."

Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

Pursuant to a request from SA Thomas J. McNiff
SA Daly of this Division contacted Michael Shaheen, Deputy Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination for the Department, on 7-22-75
concerning the current policy regarding excisions which may properly
be made on documents being furnished to the Senate Select Committee
for their review in Bureau space and the policy concerning notes being
taken during the Committee staffers review of such materials.

Shaheen stated that there is no agreement currently in
operation concerning *excisions*, however, he felt that excisions should
be properly restricted to the protection of sources, sensitive techniques
or methods concerning sensitive ongoing operations. He noted that this
is in general conformity with the proposed agreement concerning this matter
which was being reviewed at the White House. Regarding the question
raised concerning the taking of notes, Shaheen indicated that the proposed
new agreement allowed for the taking of notes on these documents which
notes may be taken to the Senate Select Committee offices. In fact,
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, K. William O'Connor, who
was present during this discussion pointed out it was the intent of the
aforementioned proposed agreement that "screened documents" may be
removed by the Committee staff members to the Senate Select Committee
offices. With this in mind, Shaheen stated we should allow the staff
members to take notes and remove same to their offices.

SA McNiff was orally advised of the results of this conversation.

# Memorandum

TO: Mr. W.R. Wannally

FROM: J.W. Redfield

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

PURPOSE:

To comment on items extracted from a 693-page document prepared by CIA citing certain instances wherein CIA believes its activities may have exceeded its legal mandate.

BACKGROUND:

Memorandum W.O. Cregar to Mr. W.R. Wannall, dated 7/24/75, captioned as above, described the above-mentioned CIA document and requested a review of certain items mentioned therein in order to fully identify the subject matter thereof and to assess whether same may involve any compromise of FBI counterintelligence operations.

CIA item captioned "Antlers," relates that CIA arranged to move a sensitive defector out of a European country by commercial transportation and gained entry into the U.S. without leaving any trace of the defector's true identity. FBIHQ COMMENT: Our files contain no information concerning the word "Antlers," in the context described by CIA. More than likely, "Antlers" is a CIA in-house code word used for the handling of a valuable and sensitive defector source. While we have no information relative to "Antlers," it is noted that we do have access currently to two CIA defector sources respectively code named TORTIS and TUMBLE, both of whom were Romanian Intelligence Service (RIS) officers whose whereabouts have been carefully concealed as both of these defectors are targets of the RIS. Specifically, the RIS has indicated a desire to kidnap and/or kill the two defectors mentioned herein. It is possible the CIA item referred to as "Antlers" may relate to either TORTIS or TUMBLE. It is firmly believed that public disclosure of the CIA item mentioned beyond that described in the attachment to W.O. Cregar's memorandum of 7/24/75, could adversely affect the safety and security of TORTIS or TUMBLE, if in fact, either one is the defector described in the CIA item.

Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

CIA item described as Project WESTPOINTER apparently involved the examination of mail to the U.S. from Mainland China during certain specific months of 1969, 1970 and 1971. CIA indicated that Project WESTPOINTER was similar to Project SRPOINTER. FBIHQ COMMENT: Our files contain no information concerning Project WESTPOINTER. Memorandum from Acting Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, dated 4/1/75, captioned "Jane Fonda v. L. Patrick Gray, et al.; Civil Action No. 73-2442-MML (C.D. Cal.)," describes a CIA covert operation known as SRPOINTER which involved examination of mail to and from the Soviet Union which was discontinued in 2/73. Apparently, CIA had examined certain mail addressed to Jane Fonda in connection with its SRPOINTER activity. While we were not aware of CIA's Project WESTPOINTER, it is noted that this Bureau did periodically examine mail coming from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Hong Kong to the U.S. and mail from the U.S. to the PRC and Hong Kong during the period 1956-1966. This activity, which was permanently discontinued 1/24/66, was carried under the code names CHIPROP and CHICLET. Public disclosure of the CIA item referred to above as Project WESTPOINTER might lead to a more detailed public examination of this Bureau's periodic control of mail in the CHIPROP and CHICLET operations.

ACTION: For information in connection with Senstudy 75.

Of the two inspections conducted of the Domestic Intelligence Division, FBI Headquarters, during 1971, and of the inspection of the San Francisco Field Office of the FBI during October, 1970.

Memorandum

TO : MR. CALLAHAN

DATE: 6/9/75

FROM : H. N. BASSETT

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

In response to a Senate Select Committee request for guidelines utilized by the Inspection Division, memorandum H. N. Bassett to W. R. Wannall dated 6/2/75, captioned as above, noted there would be no objection to a review of the Handbooks for Headquarters and field office inspections by Committee Staff members provided the review was conducted in FBI space with an Inspection Division representative present.

On 7/8/75 Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Select Committee Staff reviewed the FBIHQ Inspection Manual in the presence of SA Fred B. Griffith. Mr. Gitenstein was specifically advised these Manuals are used solely as guidelines for the Inspection Staff and are not binding on anyone but staff members. They cannot be used to document any deficiencies noted during an inspection. He was told such action would have to be based on applicable provisions in either the Manual of Instructions or the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

During the review it was noted Mr. Gitenstein made notes regarding the following Sections:

1.  Section 2 (Recording the Inspection Findings), pages 5 and 6 which deal with the assembly and distribution of inspection reports and work papers.

2.  Section 4 (Specific Division Operations), pages 4 and 5 which are concerned with surveys and audits.

3.  Section 8 (Inspector's Summaries), pages 1, 2 and 4 which deal with the summary for the Director, the letter to the Division Head from the Director and personnel write-ups.

Mr. Gitenstein stated he would return at a later date to review the field manual.

ACTION: None. . . for information.

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM: Legal/Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

DATE: 7-7-75

By memorandum, 6-18-75, you were advised the Department was considering preparing summaries of existing summaries of the so-called "Kissinger 17" wiretaps to be furnished the Senate Select Committee (SSC). The Department was awaiting our approval of this mode of response to the Committee. The referenced memorandum recommended we advise the Department that we agreed on the preparation of the summaries with the provision that we be allowed to review same prior to the Department seeking Court approval for making them available to the Senate Select Committee. This recommendation was approved.

Michael Shaheen, Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the Department, inquired of Special Agent Paul V. Daly as to when the aforementioned summaries would be completed. He was informed it was the Bureau's understanding the Department would prepare the summaries. Mr. Shaheen, after consulting with K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, stated it was the Department's desire that the Bureau prepare the summaries. He advised the Departmental attorneys concerned with the litigation arising from these wiretaps will review the summaries and seek Court approval prior to furnishing to the Committee.

RECOMMENDATION:

Intelligence Division with the assistance of Legal Counsel prepare the necessary summaries for forwarding to the Committee.

SUBJECT SENATE-SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
ACCESS TO WITNESSES

DATE: 7/18/75

At 11:40 a. m. on July 18, 1975, K. William O'Connor,
Special Counsel in the Deputy Attorney General's Office, telephonically
advised me that his negotiations with the Committee concerning more
restrictive limitations on Committee access to witnesses were not
successful. He said that the Department has determined that the
procedure in effect previously whereby the FBI Director would receive
a request for the availability of FBI personnel for interview and would
determine whether such personnel should be released from applicable
secrecy agreements would be reinstituted.

I asked Mr. O'Connor whether this meant that the Department
no longer regarded all requests for interview of present or former employees
as "demand" situations requiring the specific authorization of the Department
as if a subpoena had been issued. Mr. O'Connor said that the Department
would not consider such requests in that manner and that the FBI should
make all determinations necessary for the appearance of witnesses for
interview.

RECOMMENDATION: EX-106 REC-36

For information. We will continue to discuss requests for
interview with individuals named by the Committee in their requests,
and authorize waivers of the secrecy agreements on a case-by-case
basis.

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

DATE: 6/27/75

ALLEGATION BY JOHN ELLIFF CONCERNING
INTERFERENCE WITH COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION

At 5:14 p. m., on 6/27/75, K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, advised me that he had received a call from John Elliff of the Senate Select Committee complaining of what he described as an attempt to interferewith the Committee's investigation by supplying information to the press that the Committee had been furnished material which it had declined to use or to inquire into because of its sensitive nature. O'Connor said that Elliff claimed that a journalist who is friendly with the Committee had advised the Committee that he had information from a Justice Department official that the Committee had been furnished information originating in the FBI that Communist funds were used to finance Martin Luther King; that King had been related to the CP, USA, and that the Senate Select Committee had treated this matter as a "hot potato" and that the information also indicated that "King laughed all the way to the bank."

O'Connor said that Elliff protested the apparent disclosures by the Justice Department to the press and claimed that it appeared an effort was being made to interferewith the Committee's work. O'Connor told Elliff he had no knowledge of anyone in the Justice Department furnishing any such information to the press and further, he told him that he did not believe that information concerning CP funding of King had been furnished to the Committee.

O'Connor said that he did not believe that the FBI had furnished such information to the news media but he wanted us to be aware of Elliff's complaint. O'Connor said that it is possible that during interviews conducted by staff of the Committee, they have received statements indicating that Communist funds were used by King, but he does not believe that any documentation of that has been furnished to the Committee as vec

ADDENDUM - INTELLIGENCE DIVISION SFP:1hb 7/2/75

INTD has received no report or has any information concerning the alleged leak referred to in this memorandum.

Concerning to the allegation in this memorandum that information originated with the FBI that communist funds were used to finance Martin Luther King, Jr., and that King had been "related" to the CPUSA, the following is noted. We have never had any information that communist funds, literally, were used to finance King. We did have reliable reports that King was helped in a financial way, particularly as to advice regarding fund raising, by a close advisor, Stanley David Levison, who was a secret member of the CPUSA. However, none of our reports are known to have claimed that "communist funds" were financing King. King was never known to have been a member of the CPUSA. It is true that he had a number of close associates such as Levison who at the time were either current or past CPUSA members.

INTD is unable to pinpoint the report that "King laughed all the way to the bank."

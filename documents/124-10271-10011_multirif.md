## Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

DATE: 6/2/75

At 2:30 p.m. on June 2, 1975, a conference was held with the Deputy Attorney General attended by K. William O'Connor, Kevin Maroney, Philip White, and Robert McDermott of the Department. Bureau representatives were Mr. Callahan, Mr. Adams, Mr. Wannall and me.

Mr. O'Connor discussed the request by the Senate Select Committee for access to the 39 page report by former Assistant Attorney General Petersen concerning COINTELPRO. Though objections were presented by the Bureau representatives that the report should not be furnished to the Committee, and its enclosures, particularly the legal memoranda should not be made available, the Deputy Attorney General decided and instructed that the 39 page report should be made available to John Elliff on Tuesday, June 3, 1975, for his review, at which time he would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff request the attachments to the report, Mr. O'Connor should offer as an alternative the memoranda which initiated each of the COINTELPROS.

Upon our return to the Bureau, Mr. Adams requested that the Intelligence Division undertake an analysis of each of the summaries which were attached to the Petersen report in order to make a damage assessment based on factors that would affect current Bureau operations should they be revealed to the Committee. He also requested that this information be compiled and available to brief the Deputy Attorney General as to the difficulties that would be involved upon disclosure.

Honorable Charles E. Wiggins
House of Representatives
Washington, D. C. 20515

Dear Congressman Wiggins:

Reference is made to your letter dated April 9, 1975, enclosing a resolution adopted by the State Bar of California condemning the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for placing an informant on the staff of a legal service agency to communicate information learned in that capacity to the FBI and our response dated April 28, 1975.

Contact with the State Bar of California has enabled us to identify the situation to which they were referring.

Between April, 1968, and November, 1968, one Rudolph Leamer Muse was operated as an informant by our New Orleans, Louisiana, Division. Muse furnished information regarding black extremist activities and he was paid for services rendered. Muse was unemployed when initially volunteering his assistance to the FBI and subsequently, on May 10, 1968, began working as an investigator for the New Orleans Legal Assistance Corps (NOLAC), an organization funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity.

Information in the files of our New Orleans Division indicates during June, 1968, Muse advised it had become necessary to tell his supervisor at NOLAC of his relationship with the FBI. His supervisor became aware of Muse's association with black nationalist groups and attempted to discharge him. To avoid discharge, Muse told his supervisor he was cooperating with the FBI. Subsequently Muse's supervisor from NOLAC contacted the New Orleans Division and advised he wanted to assure the FBI that the relationship between


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

Honorable Charles E. Wiggins

Muse and the FBI would be maintained by him and would go
no further. Muse's supervisor said he was cognizant of
the importance of Muse's cooperation with the FBI remaining
confidential.

The New Orleans Division of the FBI never
conducted any investigation regarding NOLAC and Muse
never furnished information concerning its activities.

I hope this information will clarify the issue
for you. If I may be of further assistance in this matter,
please contact me.

A copy of this letter is being provided to the
State Bar of California.

Sincerely yours,

C. M. Kelley

Honorable Charles E. Wiggins

NOTE:

The resolution of the State Bar of California (SBC) referred to above did not identify the specific incident in which they were interested so Congressman Wiggins' letter was acknowledged and we indicated additional details would follow. On 4/25/75 San Francisco advised the basis for the SBC resolution was articles contained in the 2/7/75 issues of the San Francisco Examiner and Oakland Tribune. In these articles Muse was not mentioned by name but the details corresponded with his case. On 4/28/75 Supervisor Ernest Wall, New Orleans, advised Muse was identified by name in articles concerning this incident in the 2/2/75 issue of the New Orleans Times Picayune and the 2/25/75 issue of the New Orleans States Item. Since Muse revealed his relationship with the FBI and has been publicly identified by name and appears to be no privacy issue or need to protect the confidentiality of our files, Congressman Wiggins should be advised of the complete details in this matter. As the SBC urged issues such as this be considered by the select committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, a copy of this communication is being furnished for the information of the Legal Analysis Section and Project Senstudy 75 in Division 5.

CONFIDENTIAL

DCI/IC-75-0608
6 June 1975

MEMORANDUM FOR: Principal-s-of-the-USB--Ad Hoc Coordinating Group

SUBJECT: Ninth Meeting, 4 June 1975

1. A meeting of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group was held on 4 June 1975 at 10:00 a.m. A list of attendees is attached.

2. The meeting was opened by Dr. Clarke who described the current activities of the Senate Select Committee in accelerating their official interviews with knowledgeable officials across the Community and the criticality of firming up agreements on how these interviews are to be handled. This has not been forthcoming despite White House interest. House Select Committee procedure is not yet clear.

3. The second item raised by the Chairman was the list of category II "abuses" which had been developed at the direction of the Policy Steering Group. The set developed was the result of discussions with Mr. Schwarz, Counsel to the Senate Select Committee, who plans to present a complete list of "category II" items to the Committee on Friday, 6 June. At that point, it is expected "notices" would go out to the Community agencies advising them so that agreed interview procedures will apply. It is also anticipated that the presence of private as well as Agency counsel will be addressed. The Policy Steering Group has accepted the principle of dealing with these identified category II" subjects by assigning responsibility for gathering comprehensive and paper preparation to specific individuals within the Community agencies. Dr. Clarke is the focal point for gathering the names of individuals who will assume these responsibilities. To date, individuals had been named 16.1975 for all subjects except those to be handled by CIA.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 21

# CONFIDENTIAL

4. In addition to the "category II" items, there are a number of additional subjects largely geographic in nature for which the DCI feels CIA should assume responsibility for preparing comprehensive papers. In view of the apparent adversary relationship between the Senate Select Committee Staff and the agencies under investigation, it may be that preparation of papers dealing comprehensively with specific subjects will deflect some of this cross-agency probing and result in a positive solution to problems before they arise.

5. The Chairman reminded the group of the responsibility which exists to keep Mr. Cotter of the Post Office Department informed on matters resulting from the Congressional investigations which will clearly impact on his agency's affairs. At present, the cross-agency character of the interviews now under way indicate a possible communication gap in adequately coordinating on postal matters.

6. The Chairman explained the DCI's action taken in late May to separate the responsibility for CIA's response to the Congressional Select Committees from those responsibilities of the IC Staff. Both Dr. Clarke and Mr: Elder emphasized the very close relationship which exists in the two efforts. Mr. Elder will represent CIA at all USIB Ad Hoc sessions henceforth.

7. The Chairman questioned Mr. Elder, the CIA representative, whether or not the Senate Select Committee had yet furnished the Agency with a list of subjects with which they plan to deal in depth. Mr. Elder reported they have not yet done so, but it is apparent that three items are of priority interest at the moment: assassinations, the Phoenix program, and covert action; that it appears clear the Committee is currently pursuing the question of authorities, approvals, and support from other agencies.

8. The 27 May request addressed to the DCI covering materials under the jurisdiction of a number of Community agencies was provided to the members of the Ad Hoc Group. Dr. Clarke indicated he was seeking policy guidance on selected items in the request which dealt with Community product such as NIE etc. He noted the 27 May request indicated identical: letters were being forwarded to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. Copies have been sent to all USIB Ad Hoc members, the NSC and the White House.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 22

# CONFIDENTIAL

9. Copies of a memorandum which set forth the action items resulting from the Policy Steering Group session of last week were provided to the Ad Hoc members for their information.

10. Mr. Elder reported that the House Committee has indicated to CIA its intent to concentrate on specific issues, but as of now are not adequately organized to be specific in their requests. The one extant request forwarded to the CIA was posing some problems because of the lack of cleared personnel, approved storage facilities, and determinations on the ultimate disposition of records. The Chairman noted that concurrent with this meeting, a meeting of Community legal representatives was taking place with the purpose of commenting on the House Select Committee's proposed security regulations which have not yet been adopted.

11. CIA reported its success with the provision of a reading room for SSC Staff at CIA headquarters. State reported there were no comparable facilities anticipated there. Defense has provided badges to Staff members and reading facilities are available. The same accessability of materials is true at NSA and FBI.

12. The last subject on the agenda was the implementation of the Community Central Index. In the material provided to the group was a letter reaffirming the purposes of the Central Index and a list of 40 key words to be used in identifying material furnished the Index. A printout of the Index content was provided to the group as a review document only. The final format of such periodic reports has not yet been refined. Group members are encouraged to comment if they detect any problems with items in the printout. Forms for inputting information to the Central Index were also provided to the Group. This is a service of common concern which will assure the uniformity of information received and should serve to lighten the workload of the individual agencies. The telephone number of Mrs. Young of the Central Index was provided for agencies' convenience in accessing the Index information.

Q: Do you know of such having been done in the Atlanta Office?

A: No.

Q: Do you know of a tape recording pertaining to King which was sent to
Mrs. King?

A: Not during that period. It seems I might have heard such an allegation

heard it said. In any case so far as I am concerned it was hearsay.

they cover while you were in the Atlanta Office?

A: I left the Bureau over four years ago and have absolutely no knowledge of

adversely effect the Bureau's investigative position. For this reason I de-
cline to discuss this matter.

Siedel stated the Bureau had recently stated it had discontinued COINTELPRO.
The writer advised he was not aware of this; that his answer above remained the
same.

WRITER'S OBSERVATIONS

1. Siedel obviously was attempting to verify allegations made by other individuals.
2. All of his questions appeared to have been previously prepared in writing.
3. At one point he commented he was conducting this interview for a colleague (not named).
4. Siedel did not appear satisfied with the results of the interview. It is presumed he considers the writer's cooperation to be minimal.
5. As Siedel prepared to depart he was informed that during 23 years as an agent the writer suffered some adverse administrative action; that these ultimately proved to be experiences from which the writer profited. He was told the writer had "no axe to grind" regarding the Bureau and no intent or desire to accomplish any questionable literary fame.
6. Upon departing Siedel inquired as to the proximity of the Equitable Building (office building) and the First National Bank of Atlanta (also office building). Any significance to these locations was not apparent to the writer. When informed that banking hours terminated at 4:00pm Siedel made no comment.

# EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un- authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there- fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge, publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files, or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and following termination of such employment.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams DATE: June 2, 1975

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

On the morning of May 30, 1975, Mr. Robert Nichols (SA-Retired), and SA John Dennis Miller, Legal Analysis Office, met in Miller's office, prior to Nichol's appointment for interview by members of the staff of the Senate Select Committee.

Miller gave Nichols a copy of the Committee's rules at approximately 8:35 a.m. after Nichols stated he had not been given a copy by anyone else. He advised Nichols that nothing Miller was about to say was intended to or should be interpreted as an order or suggestion to be uncooperative with the Senate Select Committee or its staff.

Miller then advised Nichols he had the right to be represented by an attorney; if he is unable to retain an attorney, he should so advise the Committee staff and ask them to assist him in securing counsel; and the FBI could not provide the services of an attorney. Nichols said he understood.

Miller then escorted Nichols to the JEH Building where he met SAs Paul V. Daly and Seymor F. Phillips.

On the evening of 5-20-75 Deputy Assistant Attorney
General K. William O'Conner telephonically advised SA Paul V. Daly
of the Legal Counsel Division that the Department had reached a decision
concerning the scope of testimony to be allowed in the Senate Select
Committee interview of former SA Alan G. Sentinella. We previously
had informed the Department that Mr. Sentinella was to testify pursuant
to a subpoena before this Committee and that Department of Justice Order
501-73 requires we obtain Departmental approval before testimony may
be given. We also informed the Department that Lester B. Seidel, staff
member of the Senate Select Committee, had advised SA Daly that the
scope of the intended interview of Sentinella would include knowledge
Sentinella may have concerning the investigations of Martin Luther King,
Stanley David Levinson, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC). Mr. Seidel also indicated that they would interview Sentinella
concerning his activities between the years 1960 to 1971.

Mr. O'Conner advised SA Daly that the decision of Deputy
Attorney General Harold R. Tyler; Assistant Attorney General Antonin
Scalia, and Associate Deputy Attorney General Robert McDermott was that
Sentinella was released insofar as the Department was concerned to only
discuss three areas, those areas being the FBI investigations of Martin Luther
King, Stanley David Levinson, and SCLC. He was to advise the Committee
that he was not permitted to go outside of these three areas because of
instructions from the Department of Justice which instructions were issued
pursuant to Department of Justice Order 501-73.

On 5-21-75 former SA Sentinella was advised of the
Departmental restrictions on the information he could furnish the Committee
by SA Daly, and he was accompanied by SA Daly to the Senate Select Committee
office located in G308 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Sentinella's
interview was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Mr. Seidel met Mr. Sentinella and
at 9:31 a. m. furnished Mr. Sentinella a copy of the Rules of Procedure for

RE: SENSTUDY 75

the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities. At the same time, former SA Sentinella was furnished forms which Seidel requested he fill out at that time. Seidel also made reference to Sentinella's Fifth Amendment rights but did not specify or spell out his rights.

It was brought to Mr. Seidel 's attention by SA Daly that the Rules adopted by the Senate Select Committee called for a witness to be given copies of the Rules 24 hours prior to his appearance before the Committee and that these Rules are important for a potential witness to have knowledge of prior to his being interviewed since they contain a list of rights and privileges which a witness is entitled to. It was also brought to Mr. Seidel 's attention that despite the fact that the interview was to be initiated at 10 a. m. (initially the interview was scheduled for 9:30 a.m., however, upon arrival former SA Sentinella was advised it would not be held until 10 a. m.) with Mr. Sentinella being required to fill out forms, he would have very little opportunity to review and digest the Rules of the Committee.

Mr. Seidel was also advised of the restrictions placed on the area which former SA Sentinella could respond to by the Department of Justice. Mr. Seidel specifically requested that he be allowed to ask questions concerning "COINTELPRO!" He was advised that this was not within the scope of the Department's release for Sentinella unless such information may have been related to the investigations of Martin Luther King, Stanley David Levinson, or SCLC.

SA Daly also explained to John Elliff, Task Force Head for the Committee on Domestic Intelligence Matters, the circumstances surrounding the failure to provide a copy of the Rules 24 hours prior to interview and of the lack of specificity of Mr. Seidel as to areas which Mr. Sentinella would be interviewed.
Mr. Elliff apologized for the oversight of the Committee in complying with its Rules and assured SA Daly this would not happen again. In addition, he was advised that the Rules of the Committee provide that witnesses would have a reasonable opportunity to inspect and correct their testimony, however, the Rules provide that a witness must inspect his testimony in the office of the Committee. It was pointed out to Mr. Elliff that such procedures were unreasonable in that in Mr. Sentinella's instance, he would have to travel from Atlanta to Washington, D. C., to review the transcript of his testimony at his own expense. Mr. Elliff indicated that he believed other arrangements concerning this particular aspect of the Rules could and would be worked out.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 72

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

Mr. Sentinella at the conclusion of his testimony advised SA Daly, who was not present at the testimony, that the Committee adhered to the restrictions placed on his testimony by the Attorney General with one possible exception. They asked Mr. Sentinella if while he was working in Atlanta his squad investigated the "Klan" and "SNCC" (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee). Sentinella advised he did not raise an objection to this question because he felt the deviation from the Departmental restrictions was very slight, and our investigations of these matters were well known.

On the afternoon of 5-21-75 K. William O'Conner inquired of SA Daly how the interview went and he was generally advised of the facts surrounding the interview, including the fact that former SA Sentinella was not furnished a copy of the Rules until immediately preceding the interview. Mr. O'Conner inquired as to whether the Senator (Senator Robert Morgan [D-N.C. ]) remained during the taking of testimony from Mr. Sentinella, and he was advised that according to Sentinella, Senator Morgan departed approximately five minutes after placing Mr. Sentinella under oath.

Mr. O'Conner expressed his displeasure at the way the Committee operated and indicated he was going to discuss this matter with Deputy Attorney General Tyler.

Subsequently, on 5-21-75 O'Conner indicated he had been in contact with James Wilderotter, assistant to the Counsel to the President, and Deputy Attorney General Tyler, and they want the Bureau to prepare a letter protesting the Committee's handling of the interview of Sentinella and of the fact that they violated Rules which were adopted by that Committee, specifically the Rules requiring Mr. Sentinella be furnished a copy of the Committee Rules 24 hours prior to giving testimony to the Committee, failure to be specific concerning the areas to be covered by Sentinella's testimony, the general manner in which the rights of Sentinella were explained to him, and the fact that Senator Morgan departed from the Committee session after giving the oath. O'Conner explained in this regard Deputy Attorney General Tyler feels that this is in contravention of the Rules of the Committee, and he questions whether an executive session of the Committee being held to hear such testimony can continue in the absence of a Senate Committee Member. He requested this letter be directed to Senator Church. He was advised that such a letter could only be prepared after approval had been obtained from proper Bureau authorities, and it was also pointed out to Mr. O'Conner that we had orally protested this matter to Mr. Elliff of the Committee and Mr. Seidel, and he was apprised of Elliff's statement that such mistakes would not be repeated in the future. It was pointed out to Mr. O'Conner


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 73

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

that the Bureau had furnished former SA Sentinella a detailed briefing of his
rights and a briefing as to what was contained in the Rules of the Committee
prior to his interview. Mr. O'Conner again requested that we prepare a letter
protesting this matter.

It is not felt that a letter concerning this particular matter should
be directed to Senator Church in view of Mr. Elliff's statement that this
incident will not be repeated in the future. It is felt that our oral protest to the
Committee is sufficient at this point, especially inasmuch as they accepted the
limitations placed on the testimony of former SA Sentinella by the Department.
It would appear we could expect to achieve very little by sending such a letter
at this time.

RECOMMENDATION:

That we orally advise Mr. O'Conner the Bureau does not feel
a letter should be directed to the Committee, concerning this particular incident.

MAY 3-0.1975

Honorable Frank Church, .Chairman
United States Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence Activities
Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Church:

It is my understanding that the continuing efforts of staff members of the Executive and Legislative Branches to prepare standard guidelines for witness interview procedures are continuing this week. While that process continues, the Department of Justice is, of course, continuing to cooperate in an ad hoc and responsive manner. In order to ensure our attention to these cooperative efforts, I have designated K. William O'Connor as Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination and as such he will be the (principle liaison officer of DOJ in this effort. I understand that your Chief Counsel and members of his staff are now dealing with Mr. O'Connor in the execution of their responsibilities.

In the meantime, in an effort to expedite the cooperative provision of appropriate information to SSC, it would be most helpful if the Committee Staff would ensure that the Department of Justice is advised, in advance of Committee Staff contact with FBI employees and former employees, of the name of the witness and the scope of the prospective interview. This would facilitate the interview process, since it would make it possible to ensure that appropriate instructions are issued to the witness under 28 CFR 16.22, and would permit early decision upon the release of any applicable secrecy agreements.

cc: John Warner


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

- 2 -

In the same vein, I should like to invite your attention to some procedural matters surrounding recent witness presentation before the Committee. It appears, from reports which I have received, that two former FBI agents who recently appeared, did not receive copies of the Committee's Rules of Procedures until Immediately before appearance before the Committee; and that the scope of their proposed testimony was defined with somewhat less than optimum precision for pre-clearance. Some procedural problems are almost inevitable, especially in the early stages of hearings. I know that you share my interest in assuring that full procedural due process is unequivocally provided to all witnesses who testify before the Committee or are interviewed by Committee Staff. In calling this matter to your attention I seek your support in restricting such problems to a minimum and prospectively avoiding others of like kind.

Sincerely,

Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: 6-4-75

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 1901 BY

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that a representative of captioned Committee has advised that if the Bureau's response to a Committee request concerning the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City in 1964 is sufficiently informative it may not be necessary to interview Bureau personnel concerning this matter and to recommend that an expeditious effort be made to furnish a summary concerning the Atlantic City investigation be made available along with certain documents concerning this matter.

By way of background, we have received a request dated 5-14-75 pertaining to many items, among which was information concerning the Bureau's activities in Atlantic City in 1964 at the Democratic National Convention. At a meeting on 5-30-75 it was pointed out to the Committee that certain aspects of their May 14, 1975, request were particularly burdensome, would in some instances invade privacy and for other reasons was most difficult. During this meeting which was attended by Mark Gitenstein, staff member of the Committee; John Elliff, Task Force Director; representatives of the Bureau; and K. William O'Conner, Special Counsel to the Deputy Attorney General for Intelligence Coordination, the Committee representatives indicated that subject to the Senate Committee's approval they would accept some sort of summary with regard to their request in Appendix D, Item 8 of the May 14, 1975, request. This item pertains to the Bureau's activities in Atlantic City.

We have had former Agents interviewed concerning this matter, a request has been made to interview two Bureau secretaries, and the Committee has indicated they intend to interview as many as five additional Bureau Agents concerning this matter. In conversation with K. William O'Conner, he mentioned that the Committee had specifically informed him that if the Bureau's response was informative enough concerning

the Atlantic City matter, they would not interview the two Bureau
secretaries, Mary Ann Massa and M. Ann Mierzejewski. (The request
concerning the interview of these Bureau employees, who are Newark
Office employees, is the subject of a separate memorandum captioned
and dated same.) He requested SA Paul V. Daly to contact Mark
Gitenstein in an effort to determine what type of response the Committee
expected concerning the Atlantic City incident.

-On 6-4-75, SA Daly contacted Mr. Gitenstein and Mr. Gitenstein
advised that the Committee knew of the existence of certain memoranda
and in particular a memorandum from former Assistant to the Director
C. D. DeLoach reporting a conversation with the President requesting Bureau
coverage at the Convention. Gitenstein stated that with regard to the
Atlantic City incident, if a summary was prepared concerning this incident
which would in general show the types of people whose conversations were
monitored, the type of information collected, and the type of information
disseminated along with furnishing the Committee certain important documents
that it would not be necessary to interview Bureau personnel. He indicated
among the documents they would expect to be furnished would be the DeLoach
memorandum along with other "benign" documents which would not involve a
privacy consideration or other considerations which might preclude their
being made available to the Committee. Gitenstein indicated that it is the
Committee's feeling that information of a political nature such as the
credentials argument at the Convention was collected and furnished to the
White House and that the collection and dissemination of this information is
not apparently in concert with the ostensive purpose of electronic surveillance.
He felt that the summary need not and should not identify individuals monitored
but rather describe them such as a senator or some other descriptive phrase
to describe the individual whose conversation might have been monitored.
He said as to the verification of the information contained in the summary
with the information in the files, that subject will be addressed by the
Committee at a later time.

Gitenstein again mentioned that if such information was
furnished by the Bureau, their need to interview employees would be muted
as what they are attempting to learn through interview of Agents involved
would have already been furnished by the Bureau. He volunteered that the
Committee is relatively well informed concerning this particular matter.
It is obvious from the specific mention of the DeLoach memorandum along
with other observations and statements he made that this could well be true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75

It is realized that the White House has requested that a paper be prepared which would include the Atlantic City incident; however, K. William O'Connor indicated that he had conversed with Mr. James Wilderotter, assistant to the Counsel to the President, and that Wilderotter had advised that document requests pertaining to Atlantic City or any other topic which will be addressed in a paper should be responded to and response should not be delayed.

It would appear to be advantageous to the Bureau to attempt to comply with the summary request along with furnishing certain documents concerning Atlantic City on an expeditious basis as opposed to the Committee continuing to conduct interviews of current and former Bureau personnel. If this type of arrangement can be worked out in this particular incident which the Committee characterizes as an abuse, it might lend itself to a similar arrangement in other areas.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare a summary in line with the above concerning the Atlantic City incident along with furnishing the important documents concerning this incident.

that on that day Lester B. Seidel, Investigator, Senate Select

Attached teletype advises former Agent Richard H. Davis, Atlanta Office, had been contacted by Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Member (FNU) Epstein in an attempt by Epstein to arrange an interview concerning Bureau investigation of Martin Luther King.

On the night of 6-4-75, Michael Epstein, Staff Member SSC advised SA Paul V. Daly that he had contacted former Agent Davis to arrange interview concerning Bureau investigation of Martin Luther King, Stanley David Levison,, and Southern Leadership Christian Conference (SLCC).

Epstein stated Davis refused to submit to interview since he was bound by an employment secrecy agreement and needed necessary clearance from Bureau. He told Epstein that he would not contact Bureau for such clearance. Epstein requested Bureau release Davis from the agreement for purposes of this interview which will be a staff interview in Atlanta.

Legal Division recommends Davis be released from security agreement for purposes of this interview and to answer questions concerning the King, Levison, and SLCC investigations. If approved, we will separately advise Davis through Atlanta Office of this decision, and give him pertinent briefing.

Mr. Colby said he met earlier this week with Chairman Nedzi of the House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, John L. Boos, Chief Counsel, and A. Searle Field, Committee Staff Director. He said they seemed interested in the relationship which had developed between the Senate Committee and CIA and asked where he thought the Senate inquiry was going. They also discussed procedures regarding access to documents and witnesses and requested they be furnished some basic materials concerning the CIA's authority to conduct intelligence investigations. They also requested that the Committee be provided with all the materials requested by the Senate Select Committee. Colby pointed out that the House Resolution (H-Res. 138) which established the Select Committee prohibits the disclosure of information outside the Committee without Committee approval. There is some question, however, whether this Resolution can supersede Rule 11 of the Rules of the House of Representatives

which provides that members of the House shall have access to all
Committee records. He said Congressman Robert N. Giaimo (D-Conn.)
has indicated that he will not accept any limitations on access. Colby
said he will appear in an open session before the Committee sometime
in the next few weeks to discuss, in general terms, the agency's position on
collection of intelligence information.

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

Mr. Wilderotter said that F. A. O. Schwarz, Counsel to
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, has agreed to identify
in advance specific allegations of abuse that will be reviewed by the
Committee. Wilderotter said he will then appoint a task force or some
other coordinating mechanism within the executive branch to examine each
of these areas in depth. The purpose will be to develop an executive
department brief on each subject which can be used to respond to Committee
requests. He felt that this might enable the Administration to gain the
initiative on these issues and perhaps limit the Committee's inquiries to the
boundaries set forth in the Senate Resolution. He asked that the agencies
make an effort to identify abuse subjects so that the White House can pull
together all the information available on each topic. He said it is already
clear that the Committee will examine such subjects as assassinations
and the CIA's role in the internal affairs of Chile and the Dominican Republic.

Mr. E. H. Knoche, Assistant to the Director, Central
Intelligence Agency, reported that Mr. Colby has made three appearances
before the Senate Select Committee and on each occasion discussed
assassination matters. Mr. Colby will meet with the Committee three times
next week, and it is expected that he will be asked about the Phoenix program
and the covert activities of the CIA including political, counterintelligence,
and clandestine intelligence collection. The Committee will trace the agency's
operations back to the 1947 directive in an effort to determine how they
relate to policy objectives of the Government.

Mr. William G. Hyland, Director of Intelligence and Research,
Department of State, said the Committee has requested position papers
on the Department's activities in Laos and Chile and to explain of the Depart-
ment's approach to covert action and whether it was a supplement or instrument
of policy. Mr. Hyland raised the question of whether the agencies had any
moral obligation to advise former employees that documents were now being

made available to Congress. He felt that they should be given an opportunity to review these files prior to interview in order to refresh their memories. Mr. Wilderotter agreed and said that each agency should adopt a similar policy.

Mr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI, asked whether anyone knew what John Elliff hoped to accomplish as Director of the Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. We pointed out that his earlier writings would indicate that he intends to draft an intelligence charter for the FBI, and perhaps the entire intelligence community. Elliff has made a comprehensive study over the past several years of the Bureau's internal security intelligence functions, including sources of the FBI's authority and the legal restrictions of its operations. This was the subject of a paper he submitted at the Princeton Conference in 1971, and he has since called for the establishment of legal standards for the Bureau's collection, retention, and dissemination of intelligence information.

Mr. Buchen then requested that the FBI draft a proposed intelligence charter for the Bureau. He felt that it would be helpful for the Administration to have a proposal available which it might use to counter any recommendations made by the Committee. At the end of the meeting Mr. Wilderotter asked that a second paper be prepared reviewing all of Mr. Elliff's articles on the subject of domestic intelligence with the view toward identifying those issues which seem to be of major importance.

With regard to Mr. Buchen's request, we feel that it would be inappropriate for the Bureau to draft an intelligence charter for the executive branch. It is the responsibility of the White House and other consumers of intelligence to define their needs and propose appropriate operating authority. We also question the utility of reviewing Professor Elliff's writings on the domestic intelligence functions. We feel a better course of action at this point is simply to ask Mr. Elliff to define the goals and objectives of his task force. He has always been very candid and forthright and we have no reason to think that he would be reluctant to discuss the matter with us. In addition, it is likely his views on the intelligence function differ from those expressed in his earlier articles, and it is best to get his current thinking on the problem. If this approach proves unsuccessful, we can then resort to a review of his written materials.

This records the results of contact with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) concerning release to Senate Select Committee (SSC) of two documents pertaining to Appendix C, Paragraph 24 of the SSC request to the Department of 5/14/75, which requested "all memoranda and other materials reflecting conversations, contacts or 'communications between the FBI and the CIA on the subject of the establishment or creation of 'notional' Marxist-Leninist organizations withinthe United States."

No information has been developed indicating this Bureau conferred with CIA regarding the establishment or creation of a Bureau-sponsored "notional" Marxist-Leninist organization. Although the FBI did, in fact, direct several such organizations, no information has been developed indicating the FBI consulted with CIA regarding their establishment or creation.

In one instance, CIA advised in 2/70 it had established a notional organization with post office box addresses in Boston Massachusetts and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This notional organization, to be known as the Union for the Revolution, had the objective of developing penetrations and/or sources in revolutionary Arab groups in the Middle East. It was CIA'S intention to circulate propaganda from the post office boxes in anticipation of interesting Arab groups. Thereafter, it was CIA's plan to use its personnel under "suitable" cover to contact the Arab groups. (See memorandum dated 2/13/70, captioned "Union for the Revolution," 100-456409-2, copy attached.)

By letterhead memorandum dated 3/23/70, the FBI indicated information had been received indicating the Union for the Revolution had been in contact with a domestic Marxist-Leninist organization requesting literature. This memorandum set forth an analysis of a "Statement of the Union for the Revolution" indicating the document lacked credibility as a revolutionary document. (LHM dated 3/23/70, captioned "Union for the Revolution," 100-456409-4, copy attached.)

On 6/6/75, Mr. Walter Elder, CIA, advised that CIA had no objection to the LHM dated 3/23/70, being furnished to the SSC. With regard to the memorandum from Mr. Papich to Mr. Brennan dated 2/13/70, Mr. Elder requested that the name of the CIA representative who furnished the information in the memorandum be deleted from line one of the memorandum prior to its being furnished to the SSC. Provided this is done, CIA has no objection to this memorandum being furnished to the SSC. He suggested that when the name is deleted, it be replaced with the phrase "A CIA officer."

Appendix C, III, 24

Please provide: all memoranda and other materials reflecting conversations, contacts, or communications between the FBI and the CIA on the subject of the establishment or creation of "notional" Marxist-Leninist organizations within the United States.

No information has been developed indicating this Bureau conferred with CIA regarding the establishment or creation of a Bureau-sponsored "notional" Marxist-Leninist organization. Although the FBI did, in fact, direct several such organizations, no information has been developed indicating the FBI consulted with CIA regarding their establishment or creation.

As the Union for the Revolution was strictly a creation of CIA, it is recommended before any information be disseminated outside the FBI relating to this organization, clearance be obtained through CIA.

FROM: Legal Counsel

DATE: 6/4/75

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

At 4:55 p.m. on June 4, 1975, Daniel M. Armstrong, III, telephonically advised me that he has not as yet been contacted by the Senate Select Committee staff for interview but it was his intention to call Mark Gitenstein to discuss further his interview by the Committee. Mr. Armstrong inquired as to whether the Bureau has any objections to his discussing the two subject areas previously described by Mr. Gitenstein. Those areas were Armstrong's knowledge of the Bureau's Intelligence Division activities as a result of his employment in the FBI, and his knowledge of the possibility of the Bureau getting an Executive Order establishing the FBI's authority in security matters.

I advised Mr. Armstrong that to the extent that the interview would concern those two subjects, the Bureau would have no objection and he could consider his secrecy agreement waived, but only to that extent. Mr. Armstrong inquired as to whether there were any particular problems with information he furnished to me on May 28, 1975. I told him that the waiver of the agreement was conditioned on the one limitation that he would not furnish information that would identify informants, compromise current investigations, or on-going programs, or reveal other sensitive matters which should be reserved for the information of members of the Committee or the Chairman of the Committee.

I told Mr. Armstrong that the Bureau would have available during his interview, though not present at the interview, a representative who would provide him with counsel as to any problems concerning subjects he may be reluctant to discuss with the Committee representative. I explained that the FBI representative was not intended to inhibit any

SUBJECT: SECURITY SURVEYS - SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES - HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES - CAPITOL POLICE DEPARTMENT

Rememos Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams dated 4/9/75 and 4/25/75 concerning above-captioned matter, copies attached.

Liaison with Capitol Hill by the Office of Legal Counsel resulted in an arrangement whereby Laboratory representatives could meet with those members of the Capitol Police Force handling security surveys for the U. S. Congress. Laboratory personnel met with members of the Capitol Police Force on 5/6/75 and 5/8/75 at their headquarters, 331 First Street, NE, Washington, D. C. At the meeting on 5/6/75 an examination of their survey equipment revealed that it was adequate, however it did not meet the level of sophistication or quality available at the present state of the art. Further discussion revealed that the training received by members of the police force handling their responsibility was limited.

On 5/8/75 Laboratory Supervisors Wilbur G. Stevens and Joseph B. Parsons met with Chief James M. Powell and some of his staff members which included Deputy Chief Garner, Captain Brannon, Head of the Investigative Unit, and Lieutenant Bell, Head of the Bomb Disposal Unit. The discussion at this meeting centered around steps which could be taken to update their present security survey equipment as well as additional measures which could be put into practice to enhance their technical expertise in this area. Laboratory personnel furnished them with the names of manufacturers of additional survey equipment as well as suggestions as to the establishment of an in-house training program.

At the conclusion of this conference, Chief Powell expressed his sincere appreciation to the Bureau for the excellent help and guidance extended to him and his staff in this matter of mutual interest, and expressed the hope that he could call on us again in the event he or his staff needed to tap our resevoir of knowledge. The Chief was assured that we would be available if needed in this capacity.

It appears that the Capitol Police Force has been forced into the untenable position of handling this responsibility for the Congress, and as a result are attempting to establish some degree of self-reliance and outward credibility being completely inexperienced in this area of technical expertise. Because of this, it is felt that the Bureau should move cautiously in any continuing liaison with the Capitol Police concerning security survey matters.

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that any continuing liaison with the Capitol Hill Police Force be handled by mature and experienced Special Agent Supervisors, who are completely familiar with security survey matters.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS DECLASSIFIED
DATE 1-19-01 BY SDA/WMP

During various contacts with William Miller, Staff Director of Senate Select Committee, and Congressman Lucien Nedzi (phonetic), Chairman of the House Select Committee, the question has come up regarding the need for a check of the private offices of individual committee Members to assure the absence of any electronic listening devices. The Committee personnel have been told that we consider this absolutely essential and they agreed.

In exploring this matter, it was determined that the Capitol Police Department recently has established a special unit to handle all types of security problems within the Capitol Hill complex, including checks for electronic listening devices. Personnel of this unit have received extensive training, some from CIA. The operations of the unit are controlled through the sergeants at Arms of the House and Senate.

This matter has been discussed with Robert Saugh, Deputy Sergeant at Arms of the Senate and with Kenneth Kurdian, Sergeant at Arms of the House. House advised that the special unit already has conducted complete security surveys of the new office space of the Senate Select Committee and certainly will perform any other checks of this type requested by the Committee or its individual Members. He said, in fact, that since they now have this capability they would oppose any outside agency coming on to the Hill to perform this function. House said he already has been in contact with Miller regarding the propriety security changes/alterations in will let go know when the offices of the main Select Committee have been checked. He said their rules require specific requests from the individual Members in writing.

On 4/11/75 the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review for the Intelligence Community was apprised of the discussions with Mr. Robert Hough, the Deputy Sergeant at Arms of the Senate and with Mr. Kenneth Harding, Sergeant at Arms of the House, although the Executive Committee would have preferred the FBI to conduct audio sweeps, they interposed no objection to the sweeps being handled by the Capitol Police Department. Mr. Roderick Hills, Counsel to the President, requested, however, that both Mr. Hough and Mr. Harding be requested to periodically advice the FBI as to the sweeps of Committee space for electronic listening devices. Specifically, Mr. Hough and Mr. Harding should be asked to furnish the FBI the following: How frequently they will conduct a counteraudio sweep, what offices will be swept, will the results of such sweeps be furnished the FBI, and will the FBI be immediately notified should the Capitol Police locate an electronic listening device?

Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: 5/23/75

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES; INTERVIEWS OF FBI EMPLOYEES OR FORMER EMPLOYEES

At the Executives Conference on May 22, 1975, I presented for discussion the question of the procedures to be followed when former employees or current employees of the Bureau are contacted for interview by staff representatives of the Senate Select Committee, or are called for testimony pursuant to a subpoena issued by the Committee. I explained the background including the numerous attempts to arrive at a working arrangement with the Committee in terms of stated guidelines and that all such efforts in the past had proven unworkable.

I pointed out that when presented with the proposal that an agency representative be present during interviews, the Committee met and voted unanimously to reject that proposal. The issue of whether the agency representative would be present during the interview therefore is a stumbling block to the development of a reasonable procedure to be followed by the Committee and by our present and former employees. I requested the authority of the Executives Conference and approval of the Director to waive the requirement that a Bureau representative be present during interviews and following a vote such approval was given.

I then requested authority to undertake the development of a working understanding with the Committee in behalf of the Bureau by which we would be given notice of the identities of persons to be interviewed prior to interview or testimony, that we would be advised of the subject matter of the

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

interview or testimony, and afforded an opportunity to discuss with the witness those areas of the proposed interview or testimony which would require no special arrangements and those areas which would require the information possessed by the witness to be furnished to members of the Committee or to the Chairman exclusively.

We also wanted an opportunity prior to interview to furnish the witnesses information concerning their Constitutional rights, their rights pursuant to the Committee's rules, and to advise them concerning the extent to which they were released from obligations of secrecy made to the FBI, and to the procedures necessary to obtain authority of the Department to respond to a subpoena.

Following discussion and vote this matter also was approved.

Pursuant to such authority, I met with K. William O'Connor, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, from approximately 4:00 p.m. to 5:20 p. m. on May 22, 1975, accompanied by Inspector John B. Hotis. I explained to Mr. O'Connor that the Director was desirous of having the Committee under- stand that the FBI wanted to be cooperative to the extent that it was possible and consistent with the need to protect the identities of informants, sensitive sources of information and methods, on-going investigations and other current operations and personal privacy. Because of this view of the Director and the Bureau, we desired to make known to the Committee the fact that we would not insist on the presence of a Bureau representative during actual interviews or testimony of present or former employees, but we would want an under- standing with the Committee and the Committee staff that the Bureau would be given prior notice of the identities of proposed witnesses, the subject matter of the proposed interview or testimony, and an opportunity prior to interview or testimony for the Bureau to consult with the employee in order to release him from his obligations of secrecy to the extent possible for purposes of the interview or testimony.

I restated our position that we were not endeavoring to deter testimony rather we were attempting to facilitate testimony under reasonable conditions and we felt that these matters should be discussed with the Committee. I told Mr. O'Connor that we were aware of the numerous discussions, proposals and conferences that have been held in an effort to establish specific formal guidelines with the Committee, but that all such efforts in behalf of the White House staff and the intelligence community at

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

large have not been successful. I told him that therefore we felt it would be appropriate for the FBI to express our view to the Committee because interviews of FBI personnel and former employees have been conducted and are scheduled in the near future.

Mr. O'Connor said that he understood the Director's view that he desired to cooperate with the Committee and he felt that such cooperation could be negotiated if we were to offer the Committee as trading material in COINTELPRO files. I told Mr. O'Connor that we were not going to negotiate an understanding concerning witness interview procedures on the basis of trading any of our files. He then suggested that we negotiate the May 14, 1975, letter which was addressed to the Attorney General by Senator Church and use that negotiation as a basis for trading with the Committee to develop workable guidelines. I again told Mr. O'Connor that I considered the question of procedural arrangements for witness interviews to be a very broad question and one that went far beyond the requests in the May 14, 1975, letter. I told him that I felt confident that the May 14, 1975, letter would be followed by perhaps an even longer letter with more requests and that such matters should be negotiated individually.

Mr. O'Connor then said that it was his strong view that a letter should be addressed to the Committee complaining of the treatment of FBI witnesses, particularly regarding violations of the Committee's own rules in that it appeared that during recent interviews the Committee had not furnished witness a copy of the rules in sufficient time and the treatment by staff representatives (& the Committee staff) of witnesses had been improper.

I told Mr. O'Connor that I thought that our efforts to develop a working relationship with the Committee could be seriously impaired at this time should a protest letter be sent to Senator Church because a formal communication of that nature would require some reaction on the part of the Committee and I could see no benefit to our present efforts to establish procedures by which we could reasonably cooperate with the Committee.

Mr. O'Connor then suggested that a letter might be addressed to Senator Church which described our concern that in the absence of reasonable procedures witnesses' rights might be impaired and that for that

reason and for the reason that the Director desired to be cooperative with the Committee, we would request a meeting with Senator Church and Senator Tower to arrive at an understanding as to procedures. I told Mr. O'Connor that I would consider such a letter and he would discuss the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and with James Wilderotter at the White House.
said

At approximately 9:05 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor called me and said that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Wilderotter and the Deputy Attorney General. He said that both had agreed that it was inopportune at this time to seek special guidelines for interviews of FBI personnel and former personnel with the Committee. He said that a meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, May 27, 1975, at noon in a final effort to resolve an understanding with Committee representatives. He said at the present time it is proposed that the meeting be attended by Wilderotter and Roderick Hills, representing the White House; Hoffman, representing the Defense Department; Warner, representing CIA; and O'Connor representing the Justice Department. Committee representatives would be Schwarz, Chief Counsel, and John Elliff. He said that at this time it was his thought that the Deputy Attorney General and I should not attend the meeting. He gave as his reasoning the thought that "should something go wrong" the Deputy Attorney General could disassociate himself from any agreement arrived at, and that I would similarly be in a position of saying that we have not been a party to the agreement.

I reminded Mr. O'Connor that meetings have been held frequently in the past and that tentative understandings made at such meetings have dis- appeared shortly after the meeting was concluded. I told him that was significant to us because we now understand that two more former employees of the FBI have been contacted and may be interviewed in the near future. I told him that former SA Sam Papich and former Agent Nichols have been contacted. I told him that the extent to which we should release these two former employees from their obligation of secrecy could not be intelligently evaluated unless we knew the subject matter of the interviews and that we plan to contact the Committee to inquire as to the subject matter. I pointed out to him that such pending interviews make it imperative for the FBI to consider action in addition to meetings that may be planned to discuss guidelines.

Mr. O'Connor asked that we not contact the Committee directly at this time, but that we allow him to call John Elliff and Schwarz to request that he be advised of the identity of all proposed FBI witnesses and of the subject matter of the proposed interviews, and that such interviews or testimony not go forward pending developments of an agreement on guidelines. O'Connor promised that he would make the contact promptly and advise me today of the results. I agreed to withhold our contact pending receipt of the information from him.

Mr. O'Connor then insisted that a letter be prepared for the Attorney General to send to Senator Church pointing out the failure of the Committee to afford complete protection of the rights of witnesses. I declined to undertake that responsibility and I told him the reason was that a formal document addressed to the Chairman of the Committee would tend to impair our efforts to negotiate with the Committee and certainly would be untimely in view of the conference he described as being scheduled for next Tuesday at noon.

Mr. O'Connor then said he would hate to have to tell the Deputy Attorney General that the FBI declined to prepare such a draft. I told him that not only would I not mind him telling the Deputy Attorney General, but I wished he would tell the Deputy Attorney General and explain my reason for not sending such a formal letter addressed to Senator Church at this time. Mr. O'Connor said that "well everyone else agrees to the letter, " and I told him the FBI does not agree.

Mr. O'Connor said that if he was going to have to draft the letter for the Attorney General's signature, he would do it, but that he would need the information concerning the interviews of former SA Devlin and former SA Sentinella. I told Mr. O'Connor that the information concerning Sentinella was en route to him already and that we would endeavor to furnish him as promptly as possible any additional information available to us concerning these interviews.

At 11:13 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor called me and said that he had just concluded a conversation with John Elliff during which Elliff agreed that in regard to the scheduled interview of former SA Sam Papich on May 29, 1975, at 9:00 a.m., he would furnish us the substance of the

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

questions to be asked Mr. Papich. He said that Elliff was agreeable to an informal arrangement under which the FBI would not require the presence of a Bureau representative at such interviews, but would expect to receive the identity of persons to be interviewed plus a statement as to the subject matter of the interview. Elliff then proceeded to identify as those persons scheduled for interview as William Turner, who will be interviewed today or this weekend by Mike Epstein at San Francisco, and "Chick" Brennan, who was interviewed yesterday, May 22, 1975, by Mark Gitenstein and who may be interviewed again today.

As to the interview of Sam Papich, Elliff said that the interview would concern:

1.  A liaison agreement between the FBI and CIA;
2.  The abolition of Papich's liaison responsibilities in 1970;
3.  Dissatisfaction by the FBI with the Huston Plan;
4.  The views in the White House regarding the intelligence community and the FBI with reference to a conversation Elliff had with Mr. Wannall and Mr. Cregan on May 22, 1975;
5.  A detailed follow-up on the discussions with Mr. Wannall;.
6.  A copy of the Huston Plan and certain minutes taken of meetings at which the Huston Plan was discussed. These minutes allegedly were made by William Cregar;
7.  The matter raised with Paul Daly on May 22, 1975. (Mr. Daly recalled that Mr. Elliff discussed an incident concerning the CIA and the FBI which occurred at Denver, Colorado.)

Mr. O'Connor said that an interview proposed with former SA Nichols has been postponed indefinitely according to Elliff because of Nichols' unavailability.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. O'Connor noted that even though formal current rules have not been agreed upon with the Committee, it appears that Elliff's cooperation in furnishing the above information indicates a willingness to abide by the terms and conditions that I had requested Mr. O'Connor to seek in behalf of the FBI.

In this developing cooperation with Elliff, it is my opinion that we should not participate in the conference at noon on Tuesday, May 27, 1975, at which time the broad proposals by Wilderotter will be discussed. It is to the interest of the FBI to develop a cooperative attitude on the part of Elliff and his staff and that is being accomplished.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

At 10:37 a. m. on May 28, 1975, former FBI employee Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, III, telephonically advised me that he has received information that the Senate Select Committee may contact him for purpose of interview. He requested my advice as to what his response should be. I told Mr. Armstrong that he should be aware of any secrecy agreements he may have signed while an employee of the FBI and he should be aware of the Attorney General Order 501-73. I told him the Director was interested in being as candid as possible with the Committee and that we would be willing to release him from his agreement to the extent it would be possible to do so consistent with the needs of on-going investigations and the sensitivity of the particular information. involved. I told him that should he receive a request for interview or subpoena, it would be appropriate for him to inquire as to the general areas of discussion proposed for the interview and to request the Director to release him from the secrecy agreement concerning those areas.

Mr. Armstrong said that if he was contacted, he would respond according to the advice furnished him.

RE: FILING SYSTEM

Reference is made to memorandum from captioned
Committee dated April 30, 1975, and the appendices thereto,
which contained requests for documents and other information
from the FBI.

In connection with Part four, concerning the FBI's
filing system and printed forms utilized by this Bureau,
enclosed are copies of the following:

1.  Undated nine-page memorandum captioned "FBI
    Indexing Procedures."

2.  One copy each of 13 Tables of Contents
    concerning forms utilized by this Bureau.

Concerning the FBI's filing system and the Committee's
requests for a so-called "Clerk's Manual;" and for a list of
FBI classifications used in its filing system, it will be
noted that the nine-page memorandum contains the list of clas-
sifications. With respect to the so-called "Clerk's Manual,"
the Files and Communications Division of the FBI maintains
detailed instructions which are followed by its employees in
classifying mail for indexing. It is not known whether such
instructions are what is referred to by the Committee as the
"Clerk's Manual." These instructions consist of nine volumes
of material. Because of their bulkiness and because it is not
clear whether this material would serve the Committee's purpose,
it is not being furnished at this time. However, it will be
available for review at FBI Headquarters by the Committee Staff.

# FILING SYSTEM

The following will explain the Tables of Contents concerning FBI forms which are being furnished in lieu of the actual forms at this time. This procedure is being followed because the forms number nearly 2,000 and many will probably be of no interest to the Committee. If the Committee will review these Tables of Contents and advise which forms it desires to see, appropriate steps will then be taken to make them available to the Committee Staff. The Tables of Contents headed "FBI Form Pook" lists all FBI FD (Field Division) forms which are in use throughout the field. The remaining Tables of Contents list those forms applicable to the work of specific FBI Divisions at Headquarters. For example, forms with the prefix "1" are used in Division One (Identification); those with profix "2" are used in Division Two (Training); etc. There are no forms peculiar to Divisions 11 (Legal Counsel) and 13 (Office of Planning and Evaluation). Those forms with prefix "0" (omnibus) are for use by two or more Divisions at Headquarters.

NOTE:

Clearance for making these Tables of Contents available was obtained from the Training Division for the FD forms and from each Division for its applicable forms. The Files and Communications Division has cleared the paper "FBI Indexing Procedures."

SUBJECT: CLEARANCE OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS PREPARED BY THE INTERDEPARTMENTAL INTELLIGENCE CONFERENCE (IIC) FOR RELEASE TO THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

The following is to record the clearance of certain documents prepared by the IIC and, in some instances, the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security (ICIS) for release to the Senate Select Committee (SSC).

The SSC has been furnished a paper prepared by the Intelligence Division which was a position paper on the FBI's jurisdiction in internal security matters, intelligence and counterintelligence investigations. This paper was dated 2/13/75 and set forth information taken from certain documents or parts of documents by the IIC and, in some instances, the ICIS. All of these documents have been cleared for passage to the SSC by the following members of the IIC, as well as Mr. William Wark, Executive Secretary of the ICIS:

Mr. Rowland Morrow, Director, Defense Investigative Programs Office; Mr. Merrill Kelly, Deputy Director of Operations, ACSI, U. S. Army; Colonel Leo Olsen, OSI, U. S. Air Force; Mr. Jack Donnelly, Naval Investigative Service.

Mr. Wark advised he did not feel it necessary to clear documents through the Attorney General since they pertain to IIC matters which were merely concurred in by ICIS.

Copies of the documents involved are attached and are as follows:

Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, in March, 1969. The Bureau con-
ducted no investigation regarding the disappearance. There was
considerable publicity with reference to a statement made by
Dr. Smiley, then President of the university, that he had been
informed by a Government official that Riha "was alive and well"
Smiley was interviewed by the El Paso Office. Smiley furnished
information in the strictest of confidence, not to be dissemin-
ated to any outside agency, regarding his contacts with a CIA
representative in Boulder after the Riha disappearance. It was
the CIA official who told him that Riha was alive and well.
Without the Smiley interview our response to the Senate Select
Committee has an obvious gap. If the Committee calls any wit-
nesses in the Riha matter Dr. Smiley would be one of the most
logical persons to call. The passage of time and other factors
may have brought about a change in the mind of Dr. Smiley
regarding the necessity to keep the information furnished by him
in a confidential relationship with the Bureau and it is
believed he should be given the opportunity to either reinforce
his request for confidentiality or release the Bureau from the
restriction he imposed.

RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED SPECIAL AGENT (SA)
BY SENATOR WALTER F. MONDALE AND
STAFF MEMBERS OF THE SENATE SELECT
COMMITTEE (SSC)

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 1/18-2001 BY SPALMIRW

Set out below is information voluntarily furnished to the FBI by retired SA John P. Devlin following his voluntary appearance before Senator Mondale and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee on May 19, 1975. Devlin's appearance followed an interview of him by Senate Select Committee Staff Member Michael T. Epstein on April 25, 1975. A memorandum reporting the results of the April 25, 1975, interview was forwarded to the Attorney General as an enclosure to my letter to the Attorney General dated May 8, 1975, entitled "United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities."

On May 19, 1975, Devlin was interviewed by Senator Mondale; SSC Chief Counsel Frederick A. O. Schwarz, Jr.; Assistant Minority Counsel Charles Kirbow; and Epstein. The interview was conducted in a building across the street from the Dirksen Building in Washington, D. C., and lasted from approximately 2:00 p.m. to 3:20 p.m. Devlin was not subpoenaed to appear but appeared voluntarily. He was placed under oath by Senator Mondale.

At the outset of the interview Devlin was advised of his rights; that he could be represented by counsel and that if he had none, but desired counsel, the Committee Staff would attempt to provide one for him. At the conclusion of the interview he was thanked but given no indication as to whether he would be called to testify before the SSC.

Re: Interview of Retired Special Agent (SA) by Senator Walter F. Mondale and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

Following being advised of his rights, Devlin was asked who sent him to Atlantic City and why he was sent. He advised ho received his instructions from Special Agent in Charge Ralph Bachman through Devlin's supervisor, SA Vincent Murphy. It is to be noted here that upon being interviewed by Epstein on April 25, 1975, Devlin had indicated ho had received his instructions through his supervisor, SA William Gagnon. Devlin corrected this mistake during the interview of Ilay 19, 1975. As to why he was sent, Dovlin advised that as a sound man of the Newark Office he was sent to Atlantic City, How Jersey, to install a technical surveillance on Martin Inther Lingue who occupied a room at the Claridge Hotel in that city. Devlin was asked whether the monitoring plant for the electronic surveillance was located in the same hotel. Upon being advised it was the interviewers' desire to know whether the location of the plant at the Claridge Hotel was also designed to serve as a physical lookout on King's room, Devlin advised he was not aware that the FBI employed a physical lookout on King's hotel room. Devlin was also asked whether he installed a microphone in the room of King. He advised that he had not because it was not technically feasible. Also of concern to those interviewing Devlin on May 19, was whether he had personal knowledge as to whether the Attorney General had approved the electronic surveillance on King's telephone. Devlin replied he had no personal knowledge but assumed such authority bad been obtained by his supervisor. Dovlin was also asked if he could recall any conversations over King's phone which were monitored. Devlin replied that the only recollection he had involved con- versations betwoon King and his wife wherein they discussed her plans to travel to Atlantic City. Additionally, he did recall conversations involving the noted entertainer, Mehalia Jackson, who was appearing at that time in Atlantic City. Devlin could not recall the substance of the conversation with Jackson. He was also asked whether he retained or possessed any


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 127

Re: Interview of Retired Special Agent (SA) by Senator Walter F. Mondale and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

notes regarding the activity that occurred in Atlantic City during the Democratic Party Nominating Convention during the summer of 1964. Devlin advised that he did not retain any notes but subsequent to the original contact of him by Epstein, Devlin called SA John Connelly of the FBI Office in Newark in an effort to review any available material that might refresh his recollection. Connelly advised Devlin that all materials and notes retained by the Newark Office were forwarded to FBI Headquarters. This information was conveyed to the interviewers on the occasion of the May 19, 1975, interview.

Devlin also was asked if he ever questioned the technical coverage of King inasmuch as it appeared to be for political rather than security reasons. Devlin replied that he had no reason to question the technical coverage of King. He also was asked if he personally met with Mr. Cartha DeLoach of the FBI while both were in Atlantic City. Devlin advised he could not recall whether he actually met DeLoach, pointing out that SA Billie D. Williams was assigned the liaison responsibility with DeLoach.

Devlin was asked whether he had contacted the FBI following his original interview by Epstein on April 25, 1975. Devlin advised he had reported the interview by Epstein to the FBI Office in Newark, New Jersey. He further advised that subsequent to this, he received a call from Newark Assistant Special Agent in Charge Herbert Clough who informed him that should he be contacted in the future, and should he feel he needed to consult with FBI officials, he could call the Legal Counsel Division, FBI Headquarters, in Washington, D. C., collect, for such consultation. Senator Mondale desired to know who Devlin saw upon his arrival in Washington, D. C., on the morning of May 19, 1975, and specifically what instructions he received from the FBI. Devlin advised Senator Mondale that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 128

Staff Members of the Senate Select
Committee (SSC)

upon arrival in Washington, D. C., he reported to Inspector
John Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division and Paul V. Daly of the
FBI at which time he was advised of what obligations he had to
the Attorney General as a former employee of the FBI to protect
information obtained by virtue of his former employment in the
FBI. Subsequent to Devlin's meeting with Mr. Hotis and Mr. Daly,
he spent the remainder of the morning with SA William O. Crogar.
Mondale desired to know specifically that Devlin and Crogar dis-
cussed. Devlin advised that other than discussing mutual
friendships in the FBI, Crogar advised of what Crogar's role
would be in accompanying him to the interview and specifically
that Devlin could feel free to ask for the opportunity to con-
sult with Crogar during the interview if the line of inquiry
could possibly reveal the identity of sources, sensitive methods
or investigative techniques, information derived from third
agencies, or information which could adversely affect sensitive
ongoing investigations.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES HEREINCLASSIFIED
DATE 12/6/02 BY SPQALMYR

Reference is made to a letter from the Senate Select Committee dated March 19, 1975, requesting certain documents and other information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Two of the documents requested were the Special Report of the Interagency Committee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc) dated June, 1970, and the original report on COINTELPRO activities prepared by the Committee headed by Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen. With respect to the original report on COINTELPRO activities, pursuant to the conversation between Mr. John C. Keeney, Department of Justice, and Special Agent James C. Farrington, FBI Headquarters, on March 27, 1975, it was agreed the Department would await receipt of the Bureau's opinion prior to formulating its response to Senator Church's request for the 39-page Petersen report on COINTELPRO.

The 39-page COINTELPRO report, as well as all but one of Exhibits A through P attached thereto, contains matters relating to the internal deliberations of Department and FBI representatives who constituted the study Committee headed by former Assistant Attorney General Petersen. It is, therefore, suggested that if it is decided the report should be made available to Senator Church it be done with the provision it not be made public. REC-59 MAY 1 1975

Concerning the exhibits referred to in the text of the report: Exhibits A through L are summaries and memoranda prepared by the FBI or by Department attorneys based on their review of FBI material, and some of these are classified "Secret"; Exhibits M and N are legal memoranda prepared by Department attorneys in connection with the study Committee inquiry; Exhibit P is a work paper prepared by the FBI setting

All of theso oxhibits are in the nature of doliberativo, internal work papors wheroin opinions voro freely expressed because they were not prepared with the idea in mind of publication, and it would appear they would be exempt fron disclosuro oven if the roport itself is furnished to Senator Church.

It is, thoreforo, recommended that, duo to tho above considorations, thoso exhibits propared by the FBI not bo furnished to Senator Church if you do decide to give hin the report. It is felt the Dopartment should determine if thoso exhibits prepared solely by the Dopartmont, such as Exhibits M and N, should be furnished to the Senator, but it is our recommendation that they not be for the samo reasons as stated above.

Exhibit 0 is a press release dated December 7, 1973, which, of course, is already public source in nature.

You will recall that then Deputy Attorney Goneral Laurenco Silberman, in testimony before the Civil Rights and Constitutional Rights Subconnittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary as to why this 30-pago report should not be furnished to that Committee stated "...if we had thought it was appropriate to release the full discussion we would have dono so at the time. There are a lot of internal working documents in the Justico Department which go to the making of a final roport, This is the Attornoy General's report."

Attached for your approval and forwarding to the Committco is the original of a memorandum which cots forth the status of their request for the two documents. A copy of this momorandum is onclosed for your records.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR JOHN P. MOHR BY SEC STAFF MEMBERS

Mr. Mohr was also questioned about the procedures he followed in securing Mr. J. Edgar Hoover's office after Mr. Hoover's death. Mr. Mohr told the Staff Members that the article which appeared in "The Washington Star" by columnist Jeremiah O'Leary was an accurate recording of what took place following Mr. Hoover's death. The Staff Members requested Mr. Mohr review in considerable detail exactly what he did to secure Mr. Hoover's office following his death.

The question of former Associate Director Clyde Tolson's will was also raised by Staff Members. Mr. Mohr advised the interviewers that Hillory Tolson, brother of Clyde Tolson, had not decided at that time whether he was going to contest the will.

Mr. Mohr was also asked about the whereabouts of Miss Helen Gandy, former Executive Assistant to Mr. Hoover. He advised that he did know her whereabouts and telephone number but promised he would not reveal them to anyone. Mr. Mohr was asked whether Miss Gandy would agree to being interviewed by Staff Members of the SEC. He advised that he would attempt to persuade Miss Gandy to agree to being interviewed on the condition he be allowed to be present during the entire interview. The Staff Members interposed no objection to that arrangement and Mr. Mohr indicated that he would advise Mr. Citenstein of Miss Gandy's desires under the conditions stipulated above.

On May 12, 1975, Mr. Mohr telephonically advised that he recalled some additional topics covered during the interview of May 9, 1975, which he desires to furnish to the FBI. Specifically, Mr. Mohr recalled that he was asked if he knew who prepared the "surreptitious letters" the Bureau had mailed in the Socialist Workers Party case. Mr. Mohr advised the Staff Members that he did not know but presumed those letters were prepared in the Document Section of the FBI Laboratory.

h. Maintenance of files and records;

i. Dissemination of information from files and records;

j. So-called "COINTELPRO" techniques and methods, including all forms of organizational 'disruption.'"

Appendix B, item number 4, requests:

"For each of the techniques described in Item 5 of Appendix A above, all memoranda and other materials relating to:

a. The original decision to utilize the technique in internal security, intelligence collection, and/or counterintelligence matters, operations, or activities.

b. The policies and procedures of the FBI for the utilization of the technique in internal security, intelligence collection, and/or counterintelligence matters, operations, or activities."

It would appear appropriate that response to Appendix A, item number 5, be prepared by the Legal Counsel Division. It is also apparent that response to Appendix B, item number 4, should be closely coordinated although responsibility for research in this area would appear to fall more logically within the Intelligence Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That Legal Counsel Division assume responsibility for preparing response contained in Appendix A, Item number 5.

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Reference is made to a letter from the Senate Select Committee dated May 14, 1975, with attached appendices A thru D requesting certain documents and other information.

Under item 26 of Appendix C, a request is made for "All reports prepared by the Office of Criminal Justice of the Department of Justice pursuant to the request in September 1974 of the Attorney General and/or Deputy Attorney General pertaining to the so-called 'Wounded Knee' case and any other so-called 'political trial' or other prosecutions brought by the Special Litigation Section of the Internal Security Division."

Under item 27 of Appendix C request is made of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for "All memoranda or other materials prepared by the FBI relating to the reports described in Item 26."

The Department is requested to advise this Bureau if reports which are requested in Appendix C under item 26 with respect to the "Wounded Knee' case" were furnished to the FBI. If such reports were furnished please advise under what captions and dates these reports were submitted and identify by captions and dates all FBI communications on which your reports were based. If these reports were not furnished this Bureau please provide copies to us when you identify the FBI communications as requested herein.

![REC-100] 62-116395-188

You are also requested to provide to this Bureau copies of those reports, including sufficient information identifying FBI communications on which they were based, which will be furnished the Senate Select Committee per its request for "any other so-called 'political trial' or other prosecutions brought by the Special Litigation Section of the Internal Security Division."

# The Attorney Ceneral

Inasmuch as this Bureau's response to item 27 of Appendix C enclosed with referenced letter depends on your response to item 26, you are requested to furnish the desired information as soon as possible in order that we may comply with the Senate Select Committee roquest. Since all reports requested under item 26 were prepared by the Department this Bureau will take no action to provide copies of these reports to the Committee.

1 - The Deputy Attorney General
Attention: K. William O'Connor
Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination

NOTE:

Until such time as we determine what information will be furnished the Senate Select Committee by the Department under item 26 mentioned above we believe our response on item 27 to the Senate Select Committee should be delayed. This will enable us to provide material requested by the Senate Select Committee which will correspond to information being provided by the Department.

Trial material relating to Wounded-Knee case was handled by the General Investigative Division and this part of the request is being coordinated with SA J. C. Gordon who supervised the Wounded-Knee case. Upon receipt of requested information from the Department, General Investigative Division will be notified so an appropriate response may be compiled regarding Wounded-Knee matter. Intelligence Division will conduct necessary reviews for information pertaining to other prosecutions by "Special Litigation Section" of the Department.

Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. Adams DATE: 5/21/75

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

At approximately 9:00 a. m. on May 21, 1975, retired Special Agent Alan G. Sentinella appeared in my office prior to his appointment to receive a subpoena and to testify at 9:30 a.m. on 5/21/75 at Washington, D. C., before the Senate Select Committee. I told Mr. Sentinella that it would not be possible for me to furnish him personal counsel prior to or during his testimony, however I felt it was appropriate for me to furnish him certain information. I told Mr. Sentinella that he was entitled to be represented by a personal counsel of his own choice at any time and that if he chose to secure the services of a private attorney he was at liberty to do so.

I also told Mr. Sentinella that under the rules of the Senate Select Committee (Rule 6.4), a witness may be accompanied by counsel during testimony and a witness who is unable to obtain counsel may inform the Committee of that fact and the Committee is obliged to endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the witness. I told him that the rules further provide that the failure to obtain counsel would not excuse him from appearing and testifying.

I asked Mr. Sentinella whether he had been given any advice by the Committee concerning his right to counsel and whether he had received a copy of the Committee's rules as required by regulations in the rules (Rule 6.1). Mr. Sentinella said that he had not been so advised and he had not been given a copy of the rules by any representative of the Committee.

I told Mr. Sentinella that as to matters other than the presence of personal counsel, no understanding had been reached with the Committee.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

I further explained to him that the Attorney General Order relating to responses to subpoenas would apply to him and that we had been advised that the Department had approved a waiver of the Attorney General Order limitation permitting his testimony, but only as to matters concerning Martin Luther King, Jr., and Stanley David Levison, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, including related matters. I told Mr. Sentinella that should the questioning involve other areas and he was in doubt as to his authorization to respond, he could request an opportunity to consult with the Department to secure approval for his testimony consistent with the terms of the Attorney General Order. I also reminded Mr Sentinella that a representative of the FBI would be available during his testimony for such consultation as he felt might be necessary. I told him that SA Paul Daly would be available for that purpose.

I told Mr. Sentinella that our concern is not that matters of historical fact might be revealed, but that testimony which might be required of him could impair the Bureau's current efforts to discharge its responsibilities. I explained that in specific terms what this meant was that information that would identify sensitive sources, techniques or methods, or that would identify confidential informants, or would expose current investigative operations should be reserved for members of the Committee or perhaps the Chairman of the Committee depending upon the sensitivity of the particular information. I advised him that in the event such matters are involved in the questioning he could request consultation and that arrangements could be made for the answers to be supplied under appropriately limited conditions. I told Mr. Sentinella that as to other areas of possible testimony, the Bureau would impose no request that he decline to answer questions.

Mr. Sentinella advised me that he understood the matters I had explained to him and that he did not at this time feel the need of personal counsel because he said that he did not regard the appearance as one in the nature of a grand jury appearance. I told Mr. Sentinella that he should be aware that his testimony would be given under oath and in the event he made a statement that was self-incriminatory, it could be used against him. I reminded him I was not advising him in order to deter him from furnishing testimony, but only telling him of the protections he has under the

Constitution against self-incrimination. He said he would keep
that matter in mind.

Mr. Sentinella said that he would like to volunteer the
results of his interview at the conclusion of the interview and he also
would like to have an opportunity to review a transcript of the testimony
for accuracy.

RECOMMENDATION:

UNITED STATES SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE-ACTIVITIES

Reference is made to a letter from the Senate
Select Committee dated March 19, 1975, requesting certain
documents and other information from the FBI.

Attached for your approval and forwarding to the
Committee is the original of a memorandum which responds to
a specific request by the Committee for a position paper
dated July 31, 1972, concerning the "Scope of FBI Authority,
Jurisdiction and Responsibility in Domestic Intelligence
Investigations." A copy of this memorandum is enclosed for
your records.

You will note that the position taken by the FBI
is that the requested position paper of July 31, 1972, is an
internal deliberative document which is the direct basis for
a formal statement on FBI authority to conduct internal
security investigations embodied in a memorandum from the
Director, FBI, to the Attorney General dated August 7, 1973.
On this basis we are stating in our response to the Committee
that we feel it inappropriate that the July 31, 1972, paper
be made available. We believe that this position is completely
sound and a proper precedent to set with respect to the ambit
of the Committee's mandate. We also feel that it is consistent
with the position which has been expressed by you.

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

RE: LEGAL AUTHORITIES

Reference is made to letter dated March 19, 1975, to the Attorney General from the Chairman of captioned Committee, which enclosed certain requests for documents and other information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Under I., Legal Authorities, a general request was made for memoranda discussing the legal authority of the FBI to (1) investigate internal security matters, (2) collect intelligence information, and (3) engage in counterintelligence activities. Material responsive to this request was delivered to the Committee during April, 1975. Included in this material was a memorandum from the Director, FBI, to the Attorney General, dated August 7, 1973, captioned "Scope of FBI Jurisdiction and Authority in Domestic Intelligence Investigations." This memorandum contained a lengthy and comprehensive discussion concerning the authority of the FBI to conduct investigations in the general internal security area.

Since the receipt of the above-mentioned material the Committee has indicated a specific interest in a position paper dated July 31, 1972, discussing the "Scope of FBI Authority, Jurisdiction and Responsibility in Domestic Intelligence Investigations." This paper has been located and subjected to intensive review. It has been found that the July 31, 1972, position paper contains the internal deliberations which form the direct basis for the memorandum to the Attorney General dated August 7, 1973. In view of these circumstances and particularly because the July 31, 1972, paper is considered to be an internal deliberative document, it is not considered appropriate that it should be made available to the Committee.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemination outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel without the express approval of the FBI.

Federal Employee Security Program
Executive Order 10450

DATE: NOV 1 1974

![ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED
HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED
DATE 1-25-2012 BY SPOALM/RU]

This is in response to your memoranda, entitled as above, dated May 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy Attorney General, Criminal Division, and referring to problems which have arisen as a result of the promulgation of Executive Order 11785 which amends Executive Order 10450. In view of the involvement of my staff in these matters, I will undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the Criminal Division.

As you know this matter has been under continuing review both in the Task Force, chaired by a representative of this office, of working level representatives of various agencies in the security field and is now under study to a lesser degree in Project #10 of the "Domestic Council on Privacy".

You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instructions to the Bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations to identify and determine the activities of organizations now described in the amended Section 8 (a) (5) of Executive Order 10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau in initiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically, criteria to be utilized in determining whether available information is a sufficient basis for investigation.

Under the amendment to Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order 10450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those which unlawfully advocate or practice the commission of acts of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their rights under the constitution or laws of the United States or

NW 8296 Docld:32989588 Page 190


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 191

any State, (2) or which seek to *overthrow* the Government of the United States, or any State or subdivision thereof, by *unlawful means*: (Emphasis added).

Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate that the investigation should be initially based on a possible violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful act of force or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to detect organizations with a potential of the above nature, it is important that the investigation proceed on the basis of in- formation indicating that the organization may be of the nature mentioned. It is not necessary that a crime occur before the investigation is initiated, but only that a reasonable evaluation of the available information suggests that the activities of the organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The most recent example of the type of organization, that you have advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated to violence, Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Organizations of this nature would clearly fall within the Order and should be investigated as soon as information is available indicating their potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to the fulfillment of their purposes.

It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the investigations of such organizations if their programs call for acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the com- mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these programs.

It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling within the Order but once the investigation reaches a stage that offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investi- gation suggests a determination that the organization is engaged in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should continue.

It follows in answer to your second question that individ- uals who are active either as members of or as affiliates of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 192

zations described above should be investigated when
mation is received indicating their involvement. The
yardstick indicated above for organizations in deter-
fing whether the investigation should continue, should apply
Incerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably
De made that the individuals activities, either within the
organization or as an individual, do not appear to be in vio-
lation of any law, then the investigation should cease.

/ SUBJECT: ASSASSINATION OF JOHN FITZGERALD

DALLAS, TEXAS

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

On 5-22-75 CIA requested from the FBI copies of photographs of three "bums" who were taken into custody by Dallas authorities on 11-22-63 in the vicinity of the Texas School Book Depository. It has been alleged that the three persons shown in the photographs were E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis, individuals involved in the Watergate incident, and Thomas Arthur Vallee, who was arrested in Chicago, Illinois, several days before the Kennedy assassination based on a threat against the President. Don Donahue, Special Assistant to Senator Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), made available on 9-12-74 to Inspector Bowers a set of the photographs depicting these "bums" which had been furnished to Donahue by one Michael Canfield, and the F'BI Laboratory made copies from these prints, the original being returned to Donahue. Donahue requested that his identity be concealed as the source of these photographs. Canfield was supposed to furnish a set of these photographs to Washington Field Office but it has been determined he never did so.

At Mr. Adams' instructions, Bowers contacted Donahue on 5-22-75 and advised him of the CIA request for a set of these photographs. Donahue was told that if he has no objections we intend to furnish CIA a set of the pictures with the statement that the originals were obtained from an individual who requested his identity be concealed. Donahue stated that was quite satisfactory to him, adding that if it becomes necessary he would agree to his identity being disclosed as the source of these pictures.

MEMORANDUM FOR: USIB Principals

SUBJECT: Reporting of Interviews with Congressional Investigating Committees or their Staffs

REFERENCE: My Memorandum to Addressees, 10 April 1975, Subject: Community Aspects of Inputs to Congressional Committees Investigating Intelligence (USIB-D-27.10/1)

1. Reference memorandum reported establishment by the Intelligence Community Staff of a registry for documentation relating to the Congressional investigations, and furnished you with a format for abstracts to be provided to the registry on each formal input to a Select Committee. In addition to having in the registry the abstracts or, as appropriate, the actual papers submitted as documentation to a Select Committee, it is important that we establish a method for reporting on interviews. Accordingly, I am enclosing a proposed format for abstracts to be used for reporting on interviews by Congressional Committee members or staff with your personnel which involve information on Community activities or which, in your judgment, raise the possibility of follow-on queries elsewhere concerning the functioning or activities of the Community.

2. There is no intent to intrude upon matters which are properly each agency's organizational responsibility nor to infringe upon employees' individual rights or security. The interview abstract format does not provide for identification of the person being interviewed. The "File Reference No." entry is for your convenience to indicate where any supporting documentation is located within your own filing system.

The availability in the registry of document and interview abstracts should help provide this internal visibility.

Milton Ladd, Assistant to the Director, FBI, which forwarded as an enclosu the 9/22/48 memorandum described above. This item was also originally classified Top Secret but has been downgraded by CIA to Secret.

Memorandum to Mr. W.R. Wannall
RE: MORTON HALPERIN
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA) REQUEST

Mr. Garrison advised that CIA considers items 1 and 2 to be CIA documents and item 3 to be an FBI document containing CIA information. CIA proposes to furnish Halperin declassified copies of items 1 and 2 which have been sanitized in accordance with the brackets on the attached copies. CIA has no objection to the Bureau's furnishing Halperin a copy of item 3 if it is declassified and the CIA information indicated by brackets in the attached copy is excised. Mr. Garrison noted that CIA no longer considers the 9/22/48 memorandum to be operative since CIA's Office of Policy Coordination no longer exists.

Mr. Garrison advised further that with regard to a Senate Select Committee (SSC) request forcopies of all agreements between the FBI and the CIA, CIA does not plan to provide the SSC with copies of items 1 and 2 but plans to allow appropriately cleared SSC staff representatives to examine the unsanitized Secret versions of items 1 and 2 at CIA Headquarters. He further advised that CIA would have no objection if the Bureau allows SSC staff representatives to examine item 3 in Bureau space provided it is classified Secret in accordance with CIA's classification of its information. Mr. Garrison requested that if the Bureau decides to provide the SSC with a copy of item 3 for its retention, the document be declassified and sanitized in accordance with the attached copy.

The Intelligence Division has no objection to the FOIA request of Halperin being handled in accordance with the above. Recommendation for handling of the SSC request will be made by separate memorandum.

ACTION:-
This memorandum and its attachments should be forwarded to the FOIA Unit of the Files and Communications Division for appropriate handling.

1. This memorandum records an understanding which has been arrived at in conversations between Mr. D. Milton Ladd, Assistant to the Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Mr. Frank G. Wisner, Assistant Director, and Chief of the Office of Policy Coordination, of CIA. The conversations in question were duly authorized by the Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and by the Director and Deputy Director of CIA and were arranged by the Executive Secretary of the National Security Council on behalf of the White House. The purpose of the understanding is to provide a basis for cooperation and liaison between the FBI and the Office of Policy Coordination, CIA, and the following points. summarize the essential elements of the understanding:

a. In view of the distinctive character of the activities of the Office of Policy Coordination, it is considered advisable that separate and direct liaison be established between that office and the FBI. For this purpose the FBI will provide a special liaison officer who will be nominated by the FBI within the near future.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams DATE: 5-19-75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

K. William O'Conner, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights Division, who has recently been designated by the Attorney General to coordinate all responses by the Department to the Senate Select Committee(SSC), advised on the afternoon of 5-19-75 that he had met with Chief Counsel to the SSC F. A. O. Schwarz and John Elliff, who is the head of the task force of the Senate Select Committee on the FBI. O'Conner stated he informed Schwarz and Elliff that he would not make available Bureau secretaries Mary Ann Massa and M. Ann Mierzejewski, who arë scheduled for interview on Tuesday, 5-20-75, absent an agreement by the Committee that an FBI representative would be allowed to be present during the interview. O'Conner indicated that the Department's stand in this matter regarding the insistence that FBI representatives be present during the interview was backed by the White House, the Attorney General, and the Deputy Attorney General.

By way of background, it should be noted that Mr. O'Conner and Associate Deputy Attorney General McDermott were contacted on 5-14-75, and advised of the requested interview of the two aforementioned employees at which time O'Conner and McDermott did not advise of any way in which the employees could be prevented from consenting to interview. While they were upset at the prospect of service personnel, such as steno- graphers being interviewed by the Committee, they indicated at that time they could not see any legal leverage which could be used to preclude such interviews. With this decision in mind arrangements were made to make these employees available for interview.

Schwarz told O'Conner he would have to check with the SSC prior to agreeing to allow FBI representatives to be present. O'Conner stated Schwarz was quite upset at the Department's stance in this matter, but indicated he would give O'Conner an answer this evening. O'Conner indicated to Schwarz that the two Bureau employees would be available for interview on the 20th should the Committee agree to the presence of FBI representatives during the interview.

Reference is made to my memorandum dated 5/19/75 which attached a copy of a letter to the Attorney General dated 5/14/75, from Senator Frank Church, Chairman, United States Senate Select Committee (SSC) with appendices A thru D. The memorandum noted the ambiguous nature of some of the SSC requests and that Mr. K. William O'Conner, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, who is the Department of Justice coordinator for SSC matters, is presently negotiating the 5/14/75 requests with the SSC Staff.

Even though the negotiations are still under way, we believe that ultimately we will be required to provide substantial responses to the 5/14/75 requests. To this end we have begun to gather together the necessary data from our files in anticipation of the substantial responses we will be required to prepare. The various requests set forth in the May 14, letter have been analyzed and specific assignments made to prepare responses. The primary assignments have been made to representatives of several Sections of the INTD. It is anticipated that in some circumstances it will be necessary for these INTD representatives to convey requests for information and material to other Divisions. When such action is necessary contact will be effected through the designated representatives of the other Headquarters Divisions. A list of such other Divisional representatives is maintained by the SENSTUDY Staff on the basis of designations made to assist in previous SSC requests, and is set forth below.

# Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: 5/22/75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

On 5/21/75, Andy Smith, Supervisor in our Birmingham Office, called Deputy Assistant Director Herington and advised that former SA Robert R. Nichols (EOD: 1/6/47; retired: 5/12/72) had been contacted by the Senate Select Committee for interview. Smith connected Nichols through to Herington, at which time Nichols advised that about ten days ago Lester Seidel of the Senate Select Committee had contacted him. At that time, Nichols was going to Oklahoma City, and has just recently returned home to Birmingham. Nichols stated that at one time he was the case agent in the Atlanta Office on the Martin Luther King investigation, and it was presumed this was the subject matter of the proposed interview.

Nichols was advised that the decision as to whether he would consent to interview was entirely his to make. He was reminded that he had signed a secrecy agreement, and was reminded of the provisions of AG Order 501-73 requiring prior authority from the appropriate Departmental official prior to a current or former employee furnishing information he acquired during the course of his employment. He was also advised that he had a right to be represented by a personal attorney if he desired and that he had all the constitutional rights available to him, the same as any citizen. He was further told that if he desired to have an FBI representative available, but not present during the interview he could so request, noting that the purpose of the FBI representative would be to counsel him concerning sensitive areas which might be explored.

It was emphasized to Nichols that the FBI would not and could not recommend the course of action he should take and that the decision with regard to this interview was entirely his to make.

Respect to Intelligence Activities
Room 2308

Washington, DC 20510

Dear Mr. Seidel:

Reference is made to your telephone call to me on May 16, 1975, in which you advised that the Committee was gathering facts concerning the FBI's various CoIntelPros and in particular, you were looking into the CoIntelPro having to do with the Black Panthers. You inquired if I recalled a letter, which had been made public, dated May 11, 1970, from the Director, FBI, to the SAC, San Francisco, which suggested disruptive techniques against the Black Panthers and which mentioned spurious police or FBI reports. I advised you I had no first hand recollection of having seen such a document at that time, but that I had read a recent news item describing such a document.

You also indicated an interest in the theoretical question as to whether intelligence functions should be divorced from enforcement functions in order to avoid the dilemma of disclosure versus dismissal, and you suggested that my views on this might be helpful in educating the Committee.

For your information, I entered on duty as a Special Agent on January 5, 1942, and retired from the Bureau on December 3, 1971. During the two years immediately preceding my retirement I served as supervisor of a squad of agents which investigated, among other matters, violations and alleged violations of law by the Black Panthers. The only information I have concerning the Black Panthers was learned as a direct result of my official duties. I have made no independent study of them, nor do I have any personal files or written material, either official or otherwise, relating to them.

Since speaking with you, I have reviewed Executivo Order $501-73 (28 C.F.R.SS 16.21, 16.22 and 16.23) which specifies that no employee or former employee of the Department of Justice shall produce any material contained in the files of the Department

nor shall he disclose any information acquired in the performance
of his official duties without prior approval of the Attorney
General or appropriate Departmental official.

From this, I must conclude that I am prohibited from furnishing
you or the Committee any information along the lines requested
by you unless appropriate authority to do so has first been
given by an authorized representative of the Department of
Justice.

Very truly yours,

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

DATE: 3/20/75

I received by hand delivery from the Department at 3:06 p.m. on March 20, 1975, the attached copy of a letter from Senator Church to the Attorney General dated March 19, 1975, with its enclosed list of requests being made by the Committee.

Senator Church requests that the documents involved be supplied to the committee at the earliest opportunity. A review of the requests revealed that the Intelligence Division would have the principal interest in all except request III, A and C, which would be of interest to the Administrative Division. The last item appearing under V, B should be available only through the Criminal Division of the Department or the Attorney General's office.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  That the Intelligence Division and the Administrative Division review the attached request for FBI materials to determine whether we may make a full response to the requests.

2. That the required materials be prepared for submission to the Committee and any difficulties be made known at the earliest possible date.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting between representatives of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff and Bureau officials at Quantico, Virginia, on the evening of 5/5/75.

On 5/5/75 Mr. John Elliff, who heads the task force of the SSC looking into the FBI, met with officials of the Bureau at Quantico. Elliff was accompanied by Mark Gitenstein and Mary DeOreo. FBI officials present were Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Inspectors Thomas W. Leavitt, Hunter E. Helgeson, and John B. Hotis as well as Section Chief William O. Cregar.

At the outset of the meeting, Mr. Elliff provided the Bureau representatives with a memorandum the subject of which was entitled "Intelligence Division Position Paper on Jurisdiction," dated 2/13/75, copy of which is attached. Elliff's memorandum contained a series of questions along with the rationale for these questions which provided the basis for the Quantico meeting. We are not considering these questions a formal request from the Select Committee. Mr. Elliff and the Staff of the Select Committee are aware that formal responses that the Bureau might be expected to provide the Committee can only be predicated on written requests to the Attorney General (AG) from Senator Frank Church or the Committee's Chief Counsel.

It is noted that under paragraph one of Elliff's memorandum he notes the Committee has not been supplied the following documents.

(1) A position paper dated 7/31/72.

(2) Appendices I, J, K, M, and P to the Intelligence Division "Paper on Jurisdiction" dated 2/13/75.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

By memorandum dated 5/6/75, we advised the AG that the requested position paper of 7/31/72 is an internal deliberative document which we feel is inappropriate to furnish the Select Committee. This position is consistent with the position previously expressed by the AG. During the meeting with Elliff he was orally advised of the Bureau's position regarding making the 7/31/72 position paper available to the Select Committee.

The Appendices which have not yet been made available to the Select Committee are being cleared with other agencies under the Third Agency rule requirement and will be made available to the Select Committee once all clearances have been obtained. Elliff was orally apprised of this.

During the course of the meeting, Mr. Elliff stated that he felt the FBI's concerted investigative effort in the early 1960s against the Klan and later our investigative effort arising out of the ghetto riots were justified given the situation at that time. However, he felt the Committee would probably like to do an in-depth case study of both investigations. He asked if the FBI could provide the Committee with copies of all memoranda and documents reflecting the decision making process leading up to the initiation of the major investigative effort against the Klan as well as investigations during and following the ghetto riots. Elliff was advised that we certainly would consider responding following receiptoof a formal written request from Senator Church through the AG. Elliff advised he would prepare such a written request.

The Intelligence Division has already instituted the necessary research in anticipation of this request and will submit recommendations following a completion of this research.

In anticipation of Select Committee hearings which are expected to begin in about one month, Mr. Elliff and Gitenstein expect to start interviews of current Bureau employees in Bureau space during the week of 5/19/75. Mr. Gitenstein will concentrate on the work of the Internal Security Branch of the Intelligence Division and Mr. Elliff on the Counterintelligence Branch. We expect that Mr. Elliff will begin his interviews by meeting with Assistant Director Wannall, Inspector Leavitt and the Section Chiefs of the Counterintelligence Branch.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 232

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

It is noted that we previously furnished to the Select Committee with the AG's approval one copy each of Sections 87 and 122 of the Manual of Instructions. Section 87 is concerned with investigations of subversive organizations and individuals. Section 122 addresses extremist matters and civil unrest. In his discussion of these two Sections it was readily apparent Mr. Gitenstein had conducted a thorough review. In this regard, he noted a difference in the investigative procedure outlined in these two Sections of the Manual. Mr. Gitenstein was advised that the Intelligence Division had just completed a Manual revision combining these two Sections into one and had submitted it to the Director for his approval. Mr. Gitenstein commented this was an excellent idea to combine these two Sections into one and expressed the hope that the revised Section could be made available to the Committee for its review in anticipation of the forthcoming Committee hearings.

At the conclusion of the meeting, Elliff asked whether the FBI would be willing to meet with the Staff to discuss such sensitive issues as surreptitious entry, the opening of mail, and incommunicado interviews. Elliff was advised that the Bureau was aware of certain allegations that have appeared in the press and felt that any interviews in sensitive areas should be restricted to the Senators on the Committee. Elliff interposed no objection to this suggestion.

The thrust of the meeting gave Bureau officials present the impression that the task force was primarily concerned with identifying what areas of the Bureau's investigative responsibilities needed to be better defined through new legislation. In fact, Elliff solicited the observations of those present as to what the Bureau's needs were in the way of new legislation to permit the Bureau to carry out its internal security responsibilities effectively. He recognized certain limitations involving records of educational institutions, banking institutions, telephone companies and credit establishments currently restrict the Bureau and suggest that some legislation with Congressional oversight should be written to assist the FBI in carrying out its mission.

MEMORANDUM

From: John Elliff

Subject: "Intelligence Division Position Paper on Jurisdiction"
dated February 13, 1975

1. The following documents directly related to this Position Paper have not been supplied to the Select Committee:

(1) The previous Position Paper, dated July 31, 1972.

(2) Appendices I, J, K, M, and P.

2. Parts I and II discuss the Presidential directives which may serve as the basis for FBI national security intelligence activities. Part IV lists statutes and Executive Orders affecting FBI jurisdiction. There is no mention in Parts I and II of the first Executive Order cited in Part IV. This is Executive Order #11605, dated July 2, 1971, amending Executive Orcer #10450, of April 27, 1953, relating to security requirements for Covernment employmcat.

These Executive Orders have been further amended by a more recent Executive Order of June 4, 1974. This latest order abolished the so-called "Attorney General's List" and revised the criteria for determining the suitability and loyalty of Government employees.

The following questions arise:

(1) In what way, if any, do the Executive Orders relating to employment security provide a legal basis for FBI intelligence activities?

(2) In what way, if any, did the Executive Order of June 4, 1974, affect the legal basis for FBI intelligence activities?

3. The analysis in Parts I and II discusses the legal basis for FBI national security intelligence investigations. There is no specific discussion of other intelligence activities. These other activities are variously described in the attached documents and quoted memoranda. The terms used include "counterespionage" (Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939),

"to neutralize Communist front and Communist-dominated organizations of the United States" (IIC and ICIS Report to NSC, March 5, 1954), "program designed to intensify any confusion and dissatisfaction among its / Communist Party's members" and "counterintelligence operations" (NSC Briefing, November 6, 1958), "action proposals to protect the internal security of the United States" (National Security Action Memorandum 161, June 9, 1962). The term "counterespionage" reappears in several other documents. These terms seem to refer to activities which have since been labeled COINTELPRO operations. In this regard, it should be noted that Attorney General Saxbe's report of November 18, 1974 on FBI COINTELPRO Activities stated, at p. 20:

"(2) Espionage or Soviet-Satellite Intelligence
This program, although officially designated a COINTELPRO program, emphasized intelligence gathering and counterintelligence efforts already being pursued in connection with the Bureau's ongoing foreign intelligence responsibilities. It did not curtail any activity or in any way change the scope of counterintelligence efforts already in effect and continuing today. It was primarily intended to inspire initiative and to encourage ingenuity in the Bureau's continuing counterintelligence efforts against hostile foreign intelligence services."

In the interest of the national security, no statistics or examples of the types of actions implemented under this program may appropriately be disclosed."

This passage seems to say that the FBI continues to perform other activities going beyond investigation and directed at hostile foreign intelligence services.

The following questions arise:

(1) In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives discussed in Parts I and II provide a legal basis for FBI national security intelligence activities beyond investigations?

(2) In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives discussed in Parts I and II provide a legal basis for the COINTELPRO activities which have been discontinued as a matter of policy since 1971?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 236

(3) In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives discussed in Parts I and II provide a legal basis for the FBI's continuing counterintelligence efforts against hostile foreign intelligence services?

4. Appendix S includes excerpts from the appropriations testimony of former Director Hoover. The testimony in 1939 and 1941 makes reference to President Roosevelt's Proclamation of National Emergency, September 8, 1939. The following exchange took place at the hearing on February 19, 1941:

Mr. Ludlow. At the close of the present emergency, when peace comes, it would mean that much of this emergency work necessarily will be discontinued.

Mr. Hoover. That is correct.

Mr. Taber. Is your set-up for the national-defense work separate from the other work?

Mr. Hoover. It is.

Mr. Taber. Is it operated as a separate division?

Mr. Hoover. Yes. In the field our field officials are under instructions to utilize approximately 50 percent of the personnel on national defense work and the other 50 percent on the regular work.

Mr. Taber. But if some rush comes up, you might have to vary that?

Mr. Hoover. That is correct.

Mr. Taber. According to the situation.

Mr. Hoover. According to the emergency that might arise. If the national emergency should terminate, the structure dealing with national defense can immediately be discontinued or very materially curtailed according to the wishes of Congress.

When President Roosevelt issued the Proclamation of National Emergency on September 8, 1939, he accompanied it with Executive Order No. 8247 directing the Attorney General to "increase the personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Justice, in such number, not exceeding 150, as he shall find necessary for the proper performance of the additional duties imposed upon the Department of Justice in connection with the national emergency." At a press conference the same day,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 237

-4-

President Roosevelt specifically discussed this Executive Order and the nature of the "additional duties imposed upon the Department of Justice."

"And the fourth Executive Order relates to what you might say is a combination of neutrality and national defense. It provides for an addition to the personnel of certain investigating agencies of the Government to protect this country against--I suppose the easiest way of putting it is--some of the episodes, some of the things that happened over here in 1914 and 1915 and 1916 and the beginning of 1917, before we got into the war. There was sabotage; there was a great deal of propaganda by both belligerents, and a good many definite plans laid in this country by foreign governments to try to sway American public opinion. We do not have to specify. The older men who are here can remember some of the episodes of that time. It is to guard against that, and against the spread by any foreign nation of propaganda in this country which would tend to be subversive--I believe that is the word--of our form of Government." (1939 Roosevelt Papers 485-486)

The following questions arise:

(1) To what extent, if any, were the Presidential directives of June 26, 1939 and September 6, 1939, based on the emergency powers of the President?

(2) To what extent, if any, was the establishment of the FBI's Intelligence Division in September, 1939, based on the President's Proclamation of National Emergency and Executive Order No. 8247?

(3) To what extent, if any, does Congress have the Constitutional authority to discontinue or curtail the FBI's national security intelligence activities based on the President's emergency powers or on other Constitutional powers of the Executive Branch?

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: 5/16/75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

At approximately 3:20 PM, former SA David E. Todd
(EOD as SA 1/5/42; retirement 12/9/71) called long distance from
San Francisco and spoke to Deputy Assistant Director Herington.
He said that he had been contacted by Lester B. Seidel, Senate Select
Committee, who said that he would be on the west coast in the near
future and desired to interview Todd concerning FBI policies with
regard to investigation of racial matters and our counterintelligence
programs against the Black Panthers and other groups. Todd pointed
out that he was a former supervisor of the San Francisco Office desk
responsible for Black Panther cases. Todd asked what position he
should take. He was advised that his decision as to whether or not to
be interviewed was entirely his and that the Bureau could not make
any suggestion in this regard. It was pointed out that if he decided to
be interviewed, we had made arrangements with the Senate Select.
Committee which would permit a Bureau representative to be available
for consultation with regard to matters that might seem sensitive, but
that the Bureau representative would not be present during or participate
in the actual interview. He was advised further that he had the same
rights as any other citizen, namely, the right to personal counsel and
any other rights guaranteed him under the Constitution. Pursuant to
his request, he was also advised of the provisions of Attorney General
Order 501-73 which appears in Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations,
beginning at Section 16.21, which would require appropriate Departmental
approval prior to any current or former employee revealing, pursuant to
a subpoena or other demand, any information acquired during the course
of the employee's official duties. He was also reminded that all Bureau
employees had signed a secrecy agreement.

Re: SENSTUDY 75

Todd indicated that while he desired to respond as legally required to an official committee inquiry, he would advise Mr. Seidel that he considered himself bound by the Attorney General Order and did not feel that he could reveal official information without approval by the appropriate Department official. Todd was clearly advised that this decision had to be his own and that the FBI could not and would not make any recommendation to him as to the course of action he should take.

FROM: G. R. Steel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC)

DATE: 5-8-75

Reference is made to my letter dated 4-3-75 captioned as above (cc attached).

This is to advise that as of 5-7-75 we have received and ordered to the field a total of 96 requests from the SSC for investigations of its staff members. An additional case was received on 5-8-75 which is being ordered to the field immediately. As a result of referenced memo, Inspector Bowers contacted the SSC which was in accord with a more realistic deadline on remaining investigations, except "a few" specials which would still be handled on an expedite basis, such as afforded Presidential appointments. Of all cases received to date only six have been designated as nonexpedite.

It is noted recent articles in the media have contained criticism of Congressman Lucien Nedzi for delay in staffing the HSC and proceeding with its inquiry. On 3-3-75 Inspector Bowers discussed with the Congressman the mechanics for FBI investigations of the HSC staff. In the intervening period no cases were received except one recent case from the HSC which has been ordered to the field. This concerns Carl Hendrickson Simms, Security Director, HSC, and formerly connected with the House impeachment inquiry. Simms has been in contact with our Project Senstudy 75 group. It is not known when additional investigations will be received from the HSC.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)
HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC)

By agreement, the FBI is currently conducting full field investigations regarding SSC staff personnel. These have extremely short (2 week) deadlines which are identical to those afforded Presidential appointments and are, therefore, given preferential treatment in opening, assigning, and following field progress, The Special Inquiry Unit of the Employees Security and Special Inquiry Section, which has about twice its normal case load, is handling these requests. Senator Church, Chairman, SSC, originally estimated that between 35 and 40 staff members would be submitted for investigation. As of today, 4-3-75, we have received requests for 65 such investigations from the SSC and the end does not appear to be in sight. They are received in bunches as many as 6 at a time, which is not the even flow expected and presents an additional burden.

In addition it is expected that similar requests will be forthcoming in the near future from the HSC since we have a similar agreement with it. Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the HSC, has estimated "probably no more than about 25 staff members will be hired." It remains to be seen if this estimate also falls short of actual receipts.

Since there is no charge for these full field investigations they will have to be considered in the budget. It is noted the current charge for a full field investigation, where applicable, is $2023.

ACTION: For information. Since it appears the nucleus of the Committee has been formed, it is suggested Senator Church be contacted and queried regarding a more realistic (30 day) deadline on the remaining investigations concerning future staff members and their replacements.

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

DATE: 5/2/75

At about 1 p.m., 5/2/75, ASAC Herbert D. Clough,
Newark Division, called to furnish the following information:

The Newark Office had just been contacted by former
Bureau Supervisor Dan Brennan, retired, who resides at Sea Girt,
New Jersey. Brennan advised that he had been contacted earlier
today by Mike Epstein of the Senate Select Committee who
desired to talk to Brennan today and an appointment was set up.
Epstein was to arrive at Newark around noon and then drive to
Sea Girt, about an hour's travel. Based on information furnished
at the recent conference in New York, Newark had dispatched an
Agent to be present during this interview as requested by Dan Brennan

After completing my conversation with Clough, I discussed
this matter with John Hotis, Office of Legal Counsel, and it was
concluded the Agent from Newark who would be present during
the interview should call Office of Legal Counsel, speak to Hotis,
and obtain general guidelines for his participation in this interview.

ASAC Clough was recontacted and so instructed. I also
asked Clough to get in touch with me later in the day to let me know
what transpired.

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: May 12, 1975

FROM: Legal counsel

SUBJECT: ISSUE PAPER ON INTELLIGENCE FILES AND PRIVACY

The Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Co-ordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community identified ten issues likely to grow out of the Select Committee's deliberations. The Executive Committee asked the FBI to prepare a paper on one of these topics, Intelligence Files and Privacy. Specifically, the request was for a brief paper which raises the issues observed by the intelligence agencies when intelligence files and privacy are viewed together without, suggesting or recommending how the questions should be resolved.

J. D. Milier drafted an outline which was discussed on April 16, 1975, with representatives of the CIA and Departments of Defense and Treasury. On April 21, this outline was presented by Mr. Hotis to the Executive Committee which received it without comment. Mr. Miller then prepared a rough draft which was discussed at a meeting on April 22, with the representatives of the CIA and Department of Treasury.

Mr. Miller's final draft is attached. It discusses both intelligence files and the concept of privacy in general terms before focusing on the issues which present themselves when an effort is made to establish the proper relationship between the two.

Honorable Edward H. Levi
Attorney General
U. S. Department of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Last week's issue of *Newsweek*, on page 15, states:

## Hoover's Secrets

Following the death last week of Clyde Tolson, J. Edgar Hoover's close friend and No. 2 man at the FBI, two FBI agents reportedly removed some documents from the late director's house in Washington, where Tolson had been living. Officially, the FBI denies taking any such action, and a friend of Tolson's says the only Hoover documents Tolson had were old canceled checks and tax returns. But *Newsweek* had reported earlier that some of Hoover's private dossiers, including information "very, very damaging" to persons in the Nixon White House, were left in Tolson's custody, and a source told *Newsweek* this week that the materials were carted away in a truck.

Assuming that the files in question may be part of the so-called "Official and Confidential" files, your testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on February 27, 1975, is instructive. You said that the number of files which you reviewed contained matters relating to "Presidential directives regarding the role of the FBI in the security field" and to the matters related to "domestic

violence", "intelligence activities by hostile nations",
"domestic extremist activities", and use of the FBI to
gather political intelligence.

Furthermore, at the same time, Director Kelley
suggested that materials from the "Official and Confiden-
tial" files were taken to Director Hoover's home. He
stated:

Immediately after his death /Mr. Hoover's/
some of his employees, including his personal
secretary, went through his files and completed
the destruction of the remainder of the files
that were purely personal. These were destroyed
by shredding. Some I understand were taken out
to his home and placed in his home, they being
historical I presume to some extent. There is
no indication that they were other than personal
files.

Please determine for the Select Committee whether
any documents were removed from Mr. Tolson's or Mr. Hoover's
residence by FBI agents or former FBI agents after
Mr. Tolson's death. If agents of the FBI did go to
Mr. Hoover's or Mr. Tolson's residence to remove files,
please provide the Select Committee with a complete des-
cription of the documents taken into custody by the FBI.
Were any such documents copies or originals of documents
relating to the business of the FBI? If so, please des-
cribe the subject matter of each such document. Also
indicate the individual within the FBI who has custody
over these files. Furthermore, I respectfully request on
behalf of the Select Committee that such files not be des-
troyed or removed from the FBI's custody until further
notice.

Sincerely,

Frank Church

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In the most recent issue, April 28, 1975, of Newsweek's "Periscope" section, it is alleged that following the death of Clyde Tolson, J. Edgar Hoover's close friend and top assistant, FBI agents removed documents from the late FBI Director's house, in which ?Mr. Tolson had been living. The article further alleges that the documents removed were of the nature of private dossiers.

During the hearing of the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, on February 27, 1975, it was asserted that papers delivered to the home of 'J. Edgar Hoover after his death were of a purely historical or personal nature. In keeping with the Subcommittee's oversight jurisdiction of the FBI, I respectfully request that the Department of Justice make an independent investigation of the allegations made by the Newsweek writer and report back to the Sucomittee within a reasonable time. This investigation should cover these points:

1.  Were any documents or other material removed from the home of the late FBI Director by agents of the FBI, or others under the direction of the FRI or the Department of Justice, after the death of Clyde Tolson?

2.  If it is determined that documents or other material were removed, on whose authority was such action initiated?

TO : MR. JENKINS

DATE: 5/5/75

FROM : D.W. MOORE, JR.

SUBJECT: CLYDE A. TOLSON
FORMER ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR

The April 28, 1975, issue of "Newsweek" magazine on page 15 under its "Periscope" section, referred to Mr. Tolson's death and claimed that 2 Agents reportedly removed documents from Hoover's residence where Tolson had been living. The article, captioned "Hoover's Secrets," carried the FBI's denial of such action and also stated that a friend of Tolson's said the only Hoover documents Tolson had were old cancelled checks and tax returns. However, the article added that "Newsweek" had reported earlier that some of Hoover's private dossiers, including information "very, very damaging" to persons in the Nixon White House, were left in Tolson's custody. "Newsweek" further claimed that a source advised that the materials were carted away in a truck.

Mr. Kelley has asked of Messrs. Callahan, Jenkins, Adams and Moore, "Do you have any idea where such a story got started? Ky."

My memorandum to you of 4/17/75 captioned as above (copy attached) pointed out that Tony Marro, "Newsweek" reporter, contacted my office that date advising he had heard from a source to the effect that 2 Agents were sent to Tolson's residence the day of his death with a truck and carted away some files which were subsequently brought to the home of Mr. John P. Mohr, former Assistant to the Director. Upon checking with Mr. Mohr, Marro was advised there was absolutely no truth to the story. It should be noted that Mr. Mohr also advised at that time that most of the furnishings at Mr. Tolson's home have been removed over the past several months and that there were some associates of the family and Annie, the housekeeper who had stopped by the house on the day of the death with some empty boxes to help remove additional furnishings.

Moore to Jenkins Memo (cont'd.)
Re: CLYDE A. TOLSON

Based upon a request from Mr. Mohr to Mr. Callahan, a Bureau clerk did go to the residence of Mr. Tolson on the day of his death whereupon he delivered some 24 boxes and 6 rolls of tape. The clerk merely delivered the boxes and tape and then left the residence. We have no idea what was placed in the boxes nor how this story started in the first place.

Tony Mirro, "Newsweek" magazine, Washington, D.C., called this morning advising that he had heard from a source who has been reliable in the past, to the effect that two Agents were sent to the home of Clyde Tolson Monday evening, 4/14/75, the day of his death, with a truck and carted away some files which were subsequently brought to the home of Mr. John P. Mohr, former Assistant to the Director.

Upon checking with Mr. Mohr, Mr. Murro was advised that there was absolutely no truth to his story. It should be noted that Mr. Mohr advised that most of the furnishings at Mr. Tolson's home have been removed over the past several months and that there were some associates of the family and Annie, the housekeeper, who had stopped by the house sometime Monday with some empty boxes to help remove additional furnishings. As you know, Mr. Mohr is the Administrator of Mr. Tolson's estate and stated that there was simply no truth to the allegation that any Agents had gone to the home in a truck to transfer any files to his residence, as alleged.

# Memorandum

TO : Mr. J.. B. Adams DATE: 5-5-75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

By memorandum dated 4-30-75, directed to the
Deputy Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, signed by Chief
Counsel of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) Frederick A. O. Schwarz,
Jr., the SSC had made additional requests of the FBI. Their requests are
divided into four separate areas which are as follows: (1) Request for
prior changes in the Manual of Instructions, to those sections of the
Manual of Instructions which they have already had access to. (2) Request
to review certain sections of the Manual of Instructions not previously
furnished the Committee. A review of this list discloses generally
these sections do not pertain to foreign or domestic intelligence investigations
and some do not appear to be within the ambit of Senate Resolution 21 which
charters the authority of the SSC. Regarding the sections of the Manual
of Instructions, the request stated they would be satisfied with reviewing
them at FBI Headquarters. (3) Request certain sections of the Manual
of Rules and Regulations be made available for review by SSC representatives
at FBI Headquarters. As in request #2, some of the sections do not
appear to be within the scope of Senate Resolution 21. Among the sections
of the Manual of Rules and Regulations requested are such sections as those
concerning disciplinary matters and administration of offices. (4) A
general request conerning the Bureau's filing procedures including
information concerning our indexing system, list of classifications used
in FBI filing system, and a set of forms used by the Bureau. (Attached
is a copy of the memorandum.)

It was pointed out regarding this request to senior staff
member of the SSC, Mark Gitenstein, that some aspects of this request
appear to be outside of the scope of the Committee's authority as set
forth in Senate Resolution 21. Gitenstein explained that while this may

RE: SENSTUDY 75

be technically accurate the Committee felt it was necessary for them to come to a general understanding as to Bureau operations and that this would assist them in their review of FBI operations in the domestic and foreign intelligence areas. Gitenstein also indicated it was the Committee's feeling that Senate Resolution 21 was intended to be construed liberally and that in general it required that the SSC be furnished by the various intelligence agencies that information which would be necessary for them to carry out its mandate. It was also explained to Gitenstein that concerning their requests involving prior changes in various sections of the Manual of Instructions that they had not placed a cutoff date as to how far back the Bureau had to go to comply with this request. Gitenstein indicated that we could use 1-1-60 as the cutoff date.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) Recipients review requests pertaining to their Divisions and furnish in memorandum form their response to the Legal Counsel Division.

(2) The Legal Counsel Division will, upon receipt of responses from the interested Divisions, prepare the necessary communication to the Senate Select Committee to be approved by the Attorney General and furnished to the Committee.

(FAOS--4/30/75)

MEMORANDUM FOR DEPUTY ATTORNEY
GENERAL TYLER AND DIRECTOR KELLY

April 30, 1975

This memorandum concerns paragraph IV of the attachment to Senator Church's letter of March 19 to the Attorney General.
On behalf of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, I would like to request the following:

1. Superseded Sections of the Manual of Instructions.

Certain sections of the Manual currently in effect have been produced to us. We had intended by the request to ask for the relevant superseded sections (note the absence of the word "current" in Section IV as compared to Section IIIA) and we did indicate previously to the liaison staff that we were interested in superseded sections. But without regard to that, it is clear from documents such as the Director's letter of August 7, 1973 to the Attorney General that certain superseded sections will be highly relevant in analyzing the question of legal authority, as well as in understanding particular events in earlier years. We would appreciate their being sent to us promptly or if that causes mechanical problems, being able to promptly review them at the FBI in order to select particular portions for copying. At a minimum we would be interested in superseded Manual provisions for the sections set out in Appendix A.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 258

2. Sections of the Manual of Instructions Not Previously
   Produced. Based upon the previous production to us of the table
   of contents to the Manual of Instructions, we have identified
   certain additional sections of the Manual which we would like to
   examine. Rather than having these made available to us in the
   first instance in our offices, we suggest that they be made avail-
   able to Mark Gitenstein, and other designated members of the staff,
   for initial examination at the FBI offices. A listing of those
   sections is annexed as Appendix B.

3. Manual of Rules and Regulations. Again, based upon
   the procedure whereby we were first furnished with the table of
   contents of the Manual of Rules, we have identified those sections
   which we want to examine initially. To expedite matters, these
   sections, identified in Appendix C, could be examined by Mr. Gitenstein,
   of other designated staff members, at the FBI offices.

4. Filing System. It would also be most helpful if you
   could provide the Committee with any other written materials on
   administration of any of the filing or information systems, manual
   or automated, which are used in the course of intelligence or
   internal security activities. This does not fit within our prior
   request but should serve to make future requests more focused.

I have in mind specifically any memoranda prepared by
the Bureau on its indexing system and the so-called Clerk's Manual,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 259

if such a document exists, Please also provide the Committee with
a list of the classifications used in the FBI's filing system as well
as a complete set of printed forms used by the Bureau (*e.g.*, FD-165,
etc.).

* * * *

We believe that all the foregoing material will help
expedite and focus the inquiry. I assume that Mr. Hotis will
contact me promptly to arrange for our review of this material.

# Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: 4-30-75

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: H. R. 214; LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE
COURT ORDERS FOR THE INTERCEPTION
OF COMMUNICATIONS BY ELECTRONIC
AND OTHER DEVICES, FOR ENTERING
RESIDENCES, FOR OPENING MAIL, AND FOR
INSPECTION OF CERTAIN RECORDS

Reference Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams memorandum,
4-28-75, reporting that the Subcommittee on Postal Facilities, Mail, and
Labor Management, House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, is
going to open hearings concerning captioned bill on 5-6-75, and that the
Department of Justice will be requested to provide testimony.

Mike Cavanagh, Assistant on the Subcommittee staff,
called Inspector Bowers on 4-29-75 stating the Subcommittee Chairman,
Charles Wilson (D-Calif.), had instructed him to request a copy of the
Hoover report to the President in June, 1970, on behalf of the Committee
on Interagency Intelligence since this report contained information regarding
mail openings and possibly mail covers. Cavanagh was advised that we
have received prior requests from Congressional committees for this
document and all such requests are being referred to the White House. He
was told to contact James Wilderotter in the office of the Counsel to the
President at the White House. Wilderotter is the individual to whom we
have previously referred a similar request for this document from the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities.

Charles Whitley, Administrative Assistant to Congressman
David Henderson (D-N.C.), Chairman of the House Committee on Post Office
and Civil Service, on 4-30-75 told Bowers that the Postal Facilities
Subcommittee had scheduled the hearings regarding this legislation hurriedly
after it was determined that the Subcommittee on Government Information
and Individual Rights, Committee on Government Operations, chaired by

1 - Mr. Adams

1 - Mr. Cleveland

1 - Mr. Gebhardt

1 - Mr. Wannall

1 - Mr. Walsh

1 - Mr. Mintz

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 265

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams
RE: H. R. 214

Congresswoman Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.), had indicated an interest in holding hearings on this matter. Whitley stated hopefully Abzug's Subcommittee can be precluded from conducting any hearings in this area by virtue of the assertion of authority by the Post Office and Civil Service Committee.

James Wentzel, Office of Legislative Affairs, Department of Justice, has been alerted to the effect that an invitation will be received by the Department for testimony on this legislation.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the General and Special Investigative Divisions and the Intelligence Division promptly begin compiling appropriate information for submission to the Legal Counsel Division which can be submitted to the Department for its use in testifying or can be used as the basis for FBI testimony should the Department request an FBI representative to appear at these hearings.

Mr. Wheeler entered on duty with the Agency in September 1952 for assignment in Tokyo. During the period from 1952-1956 he served in the capacity of Deputy Chief, FI Ops and Chief, FI Liaison. For several years he served in responsible positions at Headquarters and was promoted to GS-15 in 1957. In 1959 he returned to Tokyo as Deputy for Operations and as DCOS until 1964. He was promoted to GS-16 in August 1964. From 1964-1966 he served at Honolulu Base. In 1965 he was appointed COB, Honolulu. From 1966-68 he served in the Office of Planning, Programming and Budgeting. In 1968 he was reassigned to the Missions and Programs Staff and in 1971 was appointed Chief, MPS and served there until January 1972 during which period he was promoted to GS-17. In 1972 he was appointed Chief of the then designated Nonofficial Cover Affairs Division (presently Nonofficial Cover Affairs Branch), from which assignment he is retiring.

Mr. Wheeler's outstanding characteristics are his integrity and total dedication. He is a natural leader, bright and original. He has a creative mind, is articulate and rational. He has excellent recall, is a gifted administrator and manager. He is a searching individual who is totally committed and has the high regard of most of the elements com- prising the DDO. During his tenure he has received laudatory commenda- tions for his efforts.

Mr. Wheeler has made a valuable contribution to the Agency during his extended career and it is fitting that upon retirement after such a distinguished career, he be awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion -
Robert P. Wheeler

1. As one of the final acts in my CIA career I want
   to bring to your attention and add my strong concurrence
   and recommendation to two (2) recorded recommendations for
   the promotion of Robert P. Wheeler to the grade GS-17. I
   find it hard to imagine a more persuasive recommendation
   for this action than that forwarded by my predecessor in
   June 1969 (Attached). I can imagine Mr. Mitchell's feeling
   when he prepared the second recommendation in February 1970
   (Attached). And yet, I find in February 1971 there has still
   been no action. In the year that has passed this promotion
   has become even more deserved, for despite the natural dis-
   appointment accompanying such a continuing lack of recogni-
   tion, there has been no diminution of enthusiasm, no lowering
   of standards, and the CS is clearly better managed because
   of his continuing efforts. Were these two previous recommen-
   dations not so clear cut and descriptive, I would conclude
   that those in control simply do not know what this officer
   does and has done. Knowing what he does and how he does it
   should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, I add my
   strongest recommendation for early and favorable action.

2. This officer has performed in a most outstanding
   manner, as testified in his fitness reports by my prede-
   cessor, and certainly during my tenure as Chief, MPS for
   the past 12 months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestino Service Career Service Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for the Promotion of Mr. Robert P. Wheeler to GS-17

1. It is recommended that Mr. Robert P. Wheeler be promoted to GS-17.

2. Mr. Wheeler obtained a B.A. degree in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1942 and a M.A. in International Relations from George Washington University, Washington, D.C., in 1946. He entered the U.S. Navy in 1942 and after a concerted course in Japanese served the Navy until 1946 as an Intelligence Specialist, Japanese Language Officer, and the War Department, still as an Intelligence Specialist in Tokyo, from 1946 to 1954. In September 1952 he joined the Agency for duty in Tokyo; returned to Headquarters in June 1956 where he served until 1959; left for service in Japan from June 1959 to October 1964; served under non-official cover in Honolulu from August 1964 to August 1966; served at Headquarters with the office of Planning, Programming and Budgeting (OPPB) from August 1966 until January 1968, and with MPS from the latter date to the present.

3. During his career with the Agency he has been a field Operations Officer, Liaison Officer to overseas U.S. agencies and a foreign intelligence service, a supervisor, Deputy Chief of Station (Tokyo), Chief FI for a division (FR), Chief of Base (Honolulu), Program Analyst (OPPD), and Program Analyst and Group Chief (IFS).

4. In his present position as Chief of Programs Group In the Missions and Programs Staff, Mr. Wheeler is responsible for liaison between the CS and the OPPB on the PPB System and non-budgetary matters; installing the FPB System

progress, and, as required, advising CS components on the
roquirements of P7B3 that nood to be addressed in CS docu.
nonto requiring DCI or Exocutive Director-Comptrollor

5. In his presicals assignment Mr. Wheelor was detailed
   to OFFB to give that office, in the properation of Agency
   programs for submission to the Bureau of the Budget, a battor
   understanding of clandestine collection and covort action,
   to holp that office botter rovies and integrate CS programs
   in Agency programs, and to give him a broad view of the PPB
   Bystem aud Agency naragonent in both of which ho had ahora
   considerable intercat. His performance in that office was
   ratod "Strong," and it was on that performance and on hie
   geraino onthusiasm and interest in management gesorally that
   his servicen were sought for MP3.

6. In the porformence of his duties na Chief, MP3/PPG
   he ando inmediato use of his long experience in and kocz

   in CPD, is forani douestion in the PPD Syston, and a

   management improvement. Givon the idiosyncrasion of the
   CB, họ recognized early that in order to make the PPפ
   system work oflectively knowledge of the "chy" and "how" ?
   thet system must be possessed at every decision-making level.
   With limitless energy and enthusiasm he pot about "preaching
   the gonpoi" from division chief to case officer. Whonovor
   and wherever a form formal group 10 noseubled and engagement ta
   a topic for discussion, the office of Training can count ca
   hin to drop ovorything and hold forth on the subject, bo it

their key employee. To date upwards of 100 from the CS have attended that course with many more to follow. With some of those same senior officials he has argued the benefits ultimately to accrue to their components from the temporary assignment of a senior key official for a year or two to UPS and/or CPFD and eventual return to the mother component. One such arrangement, with duty in GPPB, has just been completed. His tactful, understanding, friendly, businesslike, professional and competent handling of the chairmanship of the PRP and the reviews of the operating Directive and country activities conducted by that Panel leaves little to be desired. Regarding the PPB System, he reads everything, pro and con, that comes to his attention, and he has spent a fair sum out of his own pocket to build a library on the subject. He has persuaded potential converts to the system to read those books, magazines, periodicals and pamphlets to the end that most of that library is on constant loan. His insatiable appetite for news on current as well as historical domestic and foreign matters, his excellent sense of humor, and his genuine friendliness are invaluable assets in his present assignment inasmuch as they have given him such a wide range of acquaintances, in and out of the CS, as to open wide the door for discussion on MPS responsibilities that are anything but sexy. He is so highly regarded by his contacts in the divisions and staffs of the CS and in OPPD that his advice and guidance are constantly sought. He gives of his time and energy willingly, regardless of the grade of the individual or the magnitude of the problem. His enthusiasm is catching and he sets an excellent example for subordinates, equals and superiors as well.

7. In view of the above, Mr. Wheeler, a broad-gauged, fast moving, competent, dedicated, sincere and friendly individual who has not yet reached his full potential, whose goal is to make the Clandestine Service the best managed directorate in CIA, and who will soon have served five years in grade, is strongly recommended for promotion to CS-17.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestino Service
Career Service Board

SUBJECT: Recomendation for the Promotion
of Er. Robert P. Wheeler to GS-17

1. It is recomended that Mr. Robert P. Wheeler be
   promoted to the grade GS-17.

2. By memorandum dated 5 June 1969 the undersigned
   recommended Mr. Wheeler for promotion. In that memorandum
   was set out the career of Mr. Wheeler from the date he
   completed college (1942) until June 1969, and was described
   his wartime (1942-1946), immediate post-war (1946-1952)
   and Agency (1952-to June 1969) experienco, all in the field
   of intelligence. Eince it is the opinion of the undersigned
   that the Board should have the benefit of all the facts
   stated in that memorandum and since there is no change in
   the contents thereof, I hereby incorporate by reference
   the memorandum of 5 June 1969, make it part hereol and
   attach it hereto as a significant part of the prosent memo-
   randuma.

3. The time passed sinco 5 June 1969 has served only
   to contirm my conviction in Mr. Wheeler's true value to the
   CS. He has continued the strong leadership of the Program
   Review Panel and his subordinates, His unbounded energy
   and incessant champiosing of the applicable principles of
   the PPB System have resulted in office chiefs or otlior most
   sontor officials appearing bofore the last Program Review
   Panel apparently interested and better prepared than ever
   bofore. His obvious sincerity and friendly and intelligent
   approach to the job have convinced many of the need for
   the better management of their affairs. This is no mean
   accomplishment in a world where the normal human resants


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

even constructive criticism. Mr. Wheeler is so dedicated
to waking the CS the best managed component in the Agency
that he continues to spend his own earnings on books and
periodicals on the subject of management and to encourage
interested parties to read them and pass them on to others.

4. The undersigned is aware that for the past six (6)
   months a private interest has dangled an impressive carrot
   in front of Mr. Wheeler in an attempt to induce him to
   retire and represent overseas the interests of that private
   concern. This fact is not to be considered by the Board
   as a sword of Damocles. It is simply to bring to the
   Board's attention that if a promotion at this time should
   serve to dissuade Mr. Wheeler from accepting the proficred
   job, the Board would have been instrumental in retaining
   for the CS in the management field one of the most dedi-
   cated, friendly, readily accepted, knowledgeable, indus-
   trious and qualified officers in the Agency.

5. In view of paragraph 3 above, the contents of the
   attachment hereto, and his potential for further growth,
   Mr. Wheeler is strongly recommended for promotion to Grade
   GS-17.

MEMORANDUM FOR : Robert P. Wheeler

THROUGH : Head of Career Service

SUBJECT : Retirement Planning

1. In order to assist employees in planning for their eventual retire- ment, it is the practice of the Agency to notify each employee at a point in service five years prior to the date of scheduled retirement. I am, therefore, taking this opportunity to advise you that you are scheduled to retire in October 1975.

2. The prospect of retirement from the Agency deserves serious thought and careful planning so that you may make the transition to the next phase of life with purpose and confidence. To assist you in this regard, the Agency will make available to you various resources which are attuned to the needs of prospective retirees. In October 1970, the Agency will conduct a Retirement Information Seminar to which you will be invited. Your spouse, if you are married, may accompany you to this seminar. Following the seminar, you will be invited by the Retirement Counselor for your Directorate to an individual pre-retirement counseling session (or more than one, if you wish); this phase of retirement planning will be tailored solely to your own particular situation and circumstances and will be within the context of the retirement system under which you will retire. The individual counseling sessions are intended to give you a wide range of information on such matters as estimates of your annuity, survivor benefits, life and health insurance, Social Security taxes, relocation and movement of household effects and assistance in obtaining other employment, if appropriate. In addition to the sessions with your Retirement Counselor, you will be invited to avail yourself of selected literature on all aspects of retirement.

3. Some persons who wish to retire voluntarily prior to the scheduled date, or who wish to commence their planning as early as possible, prefer to work with their Retirement Counselor well before the time he would normally contact them. If you believe you would benefit from such an earlier start on your personal planning, you are invited to contact the Retirement Counselor responsible for your Directorate. He is assigned from your Directorate to the Retirement Affairs Division, 212 Magazine building in Roslyn, on telephone extension 3328.

4. Experience has amply demonstrated that careful planning facilitates the transition to retirement. I recommend, strongly, that you avail yourself of the services the Agency offers you in planning your own retirement.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Robert P. Wheeler

THROUGH: Administrative Officer, MPS

SUBJECT: Purchase of Service Credit

1. This is to advise you that your application to purchase service credit under the CIA Retirement and Disability System has been processed. The amount of $437.00 will be required to purchase credit for the period 18 June 1946 through 17 June 1947 when no deductions were withheld from your salary. Under the current provisions of the CIA Retirement System, payment of the above amount will increase your annuity by approximately 2 per cent of your high-three average salary at the time of retirement. The amount due includes interest to the present date.

2. It should be explained that under the CIA Retirement and Disability System, all periods of creditable Federal civilian service during which retirement deductions were not taken from salary must be purchased by making a deposit in order for the time to be counted in the computation of the retirement annuity. Under the Civil Service Retirement System, such periods of Federal service are always creditable in the computation of annuity, but if not purchased, the annuity is reduced by 10 per cent of the amount due. For example, if a deposit of $1,000 is required to purchase credit for those periods of service during which no deductions were withheld from salary, and it is not paid, the basic annuity would be reduced by $100 per year. If the deposit of $1,000 is paid, the retiree would have to wait 10 years to recover his own deposit before profiting from the payment.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 26

3. The Agoncy has as an ain: legislativoly to secure the Civil Service option, 1. o., credit for periods of non-doduction service without prior payment therefor, but with roduction of the basic annuity by 10 per cent of the anmount due. Therefore, you may wish to consider deforring payment. You should be aware that the Interest on the amount duo will continue to accumulate at the rate of 3 per cent con pounded annually if you decide to defer. For example, if it would take $1,000 to purchase credit today, the amount due one year later would be $1,030.

4. After consideration of the above options, if you wish to purchase credit for the period of non-deduction service notod in paragraph 1, please make your check payable to the Treasurer of the United States and forward it to the Chief, Retirement Operations Branch, 205 Magazine Building. If you prefer, you may mako Installment payments or arrange for bi-weakly payroll allotrients of $25.00 or multiplos theroof. A receipt showing a statement of your account will be sent to you acknowledging sach payment.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CS Career Service Board

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-16,
Mr. Robert P. Wheeler

1. It is recommended that Mr. Robert P. Wheeler be promoted to GS-16. He has been in grade since December 1957.

2. Mr. Wheeler is serving as Deputy Chief of Station, Tokyo. To this post he has brought his depth of knowledge of things Japanese, gained over many years of concentration on this subject. He has also brought his operational ability and his personal capability of operating among significant Japanese leaders. He has been of major value through a most difficult period of very substantial reduction of the station's staff and the termination of many of its functions. While Mr. Wheeler may have spent much of his time on things Japanese, he has also served as Chief, FI, for FE Division in which post he demonstrated his ability to operate on non-Japanese matters with force, intelligence and dispatch.

3. For these reasons it is recommended that Mr. Wheeler be promoted to GS-16.

Most of Mr. Wheeler's Agency career has been devoted to the Japanese scene although he served-one tour most commendably as Chief FI for the FE Division. He is now Deputy Chief of Station, Tokyo, and is an operations officer and executive of the highest quality. In addition to bearing a very large share of the administrative burden of a big station, Mr. Wheeler has acquired a collection of Japanese friends and contacts in important governmental and business circles unequaled, I believe, by any other member of the official American community in Tokyo. Although he has exploited these contacts most effectively for Agency and U.S. Governmental purposes, it is the plan of the FE Division to give freer rein to Mr. Wheeler's operations in this field by arranging, carefully and deliberately, unofficial cover for Mr. Wheeler which will permit him to devote a greater share of his time to the exploitation of this most important section of Japanese society. We believe that his very considerable talents as an administrator can be adequately replaced but that his standing among the Japanese and his capability for operational exploitation of his advantages are unique. I believe that Mr. Wheeler can well be considered to be the prototype of the high ranking staff officer who can forego bureaucratic advancement for a purely operational career under deep cover in one area.

2. On the basis of his proven ability and past performance as well as his seniority I believe Mr. Wheeler to be fully qualified for promotion to GS-16.

SUBJECT: Wheeler, Robert P. - Recommendation for Promotion
from GS-14 to 8-15

1. Mr. Wheeler entered on duty with CIA on 28 September 1952
   as a 08-14. He had, previous to that, served in a distinguished
   manner with the 2 Section of the Army in Japan in the early days
   of the occupation. His name was submitted for promotion by the
   Chief of the Japan Station in November 1955. He entered on duty
   at Headquarters an Deputy Chief of the Japan French in September 1956.
   In April, 1957 he became Acting Branch Chief and has been zerving in
   this position in a superior manner. He is 41 years of age and has
   been in grade with the Agency for 4 years.

2. A review of Mr. Wheeler's Fitness Reports will adequately
   reflect his strength and weaknesses, with the possible ezception
   of the most recent one dated 7 July 1956, in which, in the under-
   signed's opinion, the rating officer did not have ademate time to
   fairly rate 'r. Wheeler. Granting hin occasional tendency to
   allow his emotions to color his work, he is, nevertheless, one of
   the hardest working and generally capable officern I have been
   associated with. He has great ability in dealing with people, he
   is an accurate and meticulous reporter, and he is adjusting rapidly
   to the requirements of his job in Hendawrters and is turning in a
   most effective performance. In view of the length of time in grade,
   his age, and above all his performance, I strongly recommend úr.
   Wheeler for promotion from 05-14 to OS-15. It is planned in the
   near future to appoint Kr. Whealer Chier of the Foreign Intelligence
   Staff of the FE division, a most responsiolo GS-15 position.

3. While it is realized that has not had a regular tour at lead arters,
   Japan Base concurs in's roqueat, provduod it does not hinder s

4..as a unique knowledge of the Japaneco sceno, speaks the langage
and has a continuity of service that makes his service invaluable.

5. Dring the next couple of years as this base gradually reduces in size,
   and while the Japanero are still a receptive mood it is felt that much
   can be orgolished through our liaison forts. It is therefore folt
   that experience can be to the maximum benefit to KUBARK DY

1.  Enter here any desired remarks pertaining to particular qualifications or lack therof which are considered pertinent to the evaluation of this employee. Outstanding assets and/or serious limitations should be stated, also reasons for and recommendations as reassignment will be given if appropriate to this report.

Subject officer is an outstanding addition to KUBARK as a general service staff officer. He has the aggressive sense of urgency so necessary in any position of responsibility together with the necessary qualities of balance, understanding of human nature and sincerity of purpose. He would be an asset to any branch, division or staff of KUBARK home office, and would be capable of assuming almost any responsible position in an overseas post. If he has any weakness at present, it is a lack of experience in covert operations; this can be overcome before the expiration of his present tour.

During the past reporting period Mr. Wheeler has served his first full year as Chief of the newly-created Nonofficial Cover Affairs Division. He has worked hard and long to improve and simplify the procedures through which we recruit, train, and deploy our nonofficial cover personnel. He has identified accurately the bureaucratic roadblocks that stand in the way of our efficient use of nonofficial cover and if he has not succeeded in removing these barriers he has made some progress. His enthusiasm for the job and his belief that it can be done have been invaluable during a formative period, and his performance on the shole has been a strong one.

2.  Mr. Wheeler's outstanding characteristics are his integrity and total dedication to the continuing upgrading of management within the CS at all levels. By background, interest and training; by service in OPPB; by full-time participation in the Federal Executive Instituto; and by his abiding determination to instill others with a similar will for perfection within the CS, he has made a valuable contribution to the Missions and Programs Staff (MPS) and to the Clandestine Services.

3.  As chief of the Program Review Panel he has chaired the hearings of the various divisions with a great degree of sensitivity and knowledge, and has upgraded the quality and substance of those hearings. He has been especially helpful in those instances where divisions have proposed new approaches, as well as in the development of new and effective management techniques designed to simplify control and to coordinate the activities of headquarters elements and field stations.

4.  Mr. Wheeler is a natural leader, bright and original. His is a creative mind, and innovative. He is articulate, rational, and thinks and talks sequentially.

5. Mr. Wheeler also has the gift of being able to absorb rapidly and commit to paper accurately and quickly, a characteristic and asset of his which has much to commend it.

6. He has been a superb deputy, acting in this capacity in my absence. He has excellent recall, is a gifted administrator, and has introduced a number of procedural changes that have increased MPS effectiveness. He has been effective in dealing with OPPB and in par- ticipation in the briefings of Office of Manageinent and Budget (OMB) personnel. He is very cost conscious and has made several suggestions resulting in the saving of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. Wheeler has always enthusiastically accepted assignments to panels designed to upgrade the quality of various trouble areas, the latest being the search- ing look into the nonofficial cover situation within the. CS.

7. Mr. Wheeler is a searching individual who is totally com- mitted to the Plans Directorate and has the high regard of most of the elements comprising the Clandestine Services,

His unusual dedication and sensible approach to and great enthusiasm for the tenets of PPBS have contributed immensely to the system's installation in the Clandestine Service: His energy, logical reasoning and sincerity have infected his numerous contacts within the CS and are goals which his officer-subordinates are striving to attain.

His wide CS experience, affability, sincerity, intelligence and dedication to the missions of the Agency, all of which have continued to be in evidence during the reporting period, make Mr. Wheeler, in the opinion of the Rating Officer, one of the CS' most valuable officers.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Fitness Report (Annual) -
Robert P. Wheeler

1. In compliance with HR 20-20, this memorandum is submitted in lieu of Fitness Report Form 45 covering the performance of Mr. Wheeler from January 1968 to 31 March 1969.

2. In late 1967 it was determined that Mr. Wheeler would be reassigned in June 1968 from the Office of Planning, Programming and Budgeting (OPPB) to the Missions and Programs Staff (MPS). Under an arrangement with the Director of PPB, Mr. Wheeler was lent to MPS on 1 January 1968 for the purpose of preparing himself to assume the functions of Chief of the Programs Group (PRG) in MPS. Accordingly, what follows covers the period of the loan, from 1 January to 11 June 1968, and the period as Chief, PRG, from 12 June 1968 to 31 March 1959.

3. From 1 January to 11 June 1958. During the period of Toan to UPS, ar. Wheeler understudied the then Chief of PRG, acquainted himself with all Group files and responsibilities, attended the Advanced Management (Planning) Seminar and performed numerous ad hoc tasks assigned him by C/MPS. He prepared himself for the new assignment and performed the ad hoc tasks assigned with such dispatch, enthusiasm and intelligence as to augur well for the future. No minor task was too menial; every major task was readily accepted as a challenge. In short, his preparation for the new position soon to be assumed left little to be desired on the part of the Rating Officer.

4. From 12 June 1968 to 31 March 1969. As Chief of PRG, Mr. Wheeler is responsible for, inter alia, liaison on non-budgetary matters between the CS and OPPB; in- stalling the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) within the CS: advising and assisting CS components in the preparation of Operating Directives and the program

portions of the annual Operating Program responses; chair-
ing the Program Review Panel; preparing and/or coordinating
special studies and surveys on operational programs; and,
as required, advising CS components on the requirements of
PPBS that need to be addressed in CS documents requiring
DCI or Executive Director-Comptroller action.

5. In carrying out the functions enumerated in para-
   graph 4, above, Mr. Wheeler has displayed drive, initiative,
   enthusiasm and understanding. He has pushed within the CS
   on those concepts of PPBS that are considered applicable
   to an intelligence organization and has argued with OPPB
   against forcing the CS to apply those concepts which are
   not considered to be applicable. He has worked diligently,
   alone and with the assistance of the DDP/TRO, to spread
   throughout the CS an understanding of the why and how of
   PPBS. He has prepared himself well for and has exercised
   sound judgment and tact in the handling of the chairman-
   ship of the Program Review Panel, on the actions of which
   he has brought to bear his experiences in OPPB. He has
   given unstintingly of his time to lecturing at Agency
   management courses when requested. Although he understands
   the need for flexibility in the CS, he has to be slowed
   down at times so anxious is he to make the CS the best
   managed directorate in the Agency. His sincere interest
   in good management has made him and the two senior officers
   he supervises cost conscious. This affable, conscientious,
   dedicated, highly experienced, intelligent employee, who
   already has given evidence of a strong performance, is a
   pleasure to collaborate with and a valuable asset to MPS
   and the CS.

REFERENCE: HR 20-20c(2)

1. In accordance with reference, this memorandum is submitted in lieu of a Fitness Report (Form 45). This is an annual report but in view of Mr. Wheeler's transfer to the Missions and Programs Staff, DD/P, in January 1968, it covers only the period April 1967 through December 1967.

2. Mr. Wheeler's assignment as Program Analyst involved:
   (a) reviewing and evaluating Agency activities, principally covert action programs; (b) participating in special in-depth studies of selected Agency activities; (c) preparing the Covert Action Program Memorandum for the Director's approval and submission to the Bureau of the Budget; (d) keeping abreast of Agency plans, programs, and progress toward defined objectives; (e) providing general staff assistance to the Director/ PPB in implementing the Agency planning, programming, and badgeting system; and (f) preparing special presentations and correspondence for the Office of the Director.

3. During the year, Mr. Wheeler participated in a survey by the Inspector General of Agency proprietary organizations. He contributed significantly to the study. In addition, he was the Office monitor for at least two studies for the Bureau of the Budget.

4. Mr. Wheeler was the principal analyst assigned to the review of the Agency's Covert Action Program. He reviewed Directorate program plans and proposals, identified issues to be raised with the Director, and prepared a Program Memorandum for the Director's approval which presented Agency Covert Action plans and programs for the next five years.

In summary, Mr. Wheeler made a significant contribution while in the Office. In view of the similarity in functions between the two organizations, I would expect this contribution to be carried forward to his new assignment.

6. I rate Mr. Wheeler's over-all performance during the period as Strong.

He has enthusiastically supported the development of a system adapted to Agency needs and has made significant contributions toward this end.

   I thought that from a broad, general standpoint the orientation was worthwhile but that far more BOB participation would have enhanced the program greatly. There was too much of "we think this is what BOB means" and too little of BOB saying "this is what we mean". I found the movie presentation of Dr. E. S. Quade's speech terrible because of inept projection, faulty audio equipment, and out-of-place music. Dr. Quade had a message and fortunately the CSC planoers must have known their film was inadequate, for we were provided with the written text. Outstanding possibly because he stood out so far in comparison to the others was Mr. Peter Szanton from BOB. Dr. Adams from the University of Maryland was quite good and Mr. Greenhouse of VA was one of the few others who really seemed to know what he was talking about beyond immediate low to medium level parochial application.

Official Title: Chief of Base

Assignment: DDP/DOD/USS

Current Station: Honolulu, Hawaii

Appointment: Career

Reporting Period: 1 April 1965 - 31 March 1966

1. During the past year it has clearly emerged that the Honolulu area offers very limited opportunities for CS operational action. The main target of a Honolulu base, as originally conceived by FE Division, was the East-West Center with its large number of Asian students. Although, during the 1964-65 academic year several prospective candidates for the WUENVOY program were assessed and one recruited, political developments in Southeast Asia prevented the arrival of any students at the Center from the priority Southeast Asian countries: Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia.

2. It is against this perspective that Subject's performance during the past year should be evaluated. He approached his job with enthusiasm and vigor but soon found that there were no tangible operational activities ho could devote himself or his supporting agents to. He has been frank to state officially and unofficially the absence of any targets to which an operational base could direct itself and has therefore been relatively unoccupied during this period except for an occasional item of local coordination or follow-up on a headquarters task. Subject has had under his direct supervision a long-term Staff Agent at the University of Hawaii and two Staff Agents assigned to the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

University as students for the current academic year. He has handled them well and has done his best to maintain their morale in spite of the fact that there were only a few specific targets on whom they could systematically work.

3. Subject is a mature, experienced and energetic officer with both operational and scholarly interests in Far Eastern, especially Japanese, affairs. His talents are obviously being wasted in Honolulu and arrangements have already been made to have him reassigned. The base itself will be phased down in the summer of 1966 with two of the three Staff Agents reassigned, the long-term Staff Agent kept on at the University, and a more junior officer replacing Subject as COB.

4. Subject has displayed an economical approach to the use both of funds and personnel.

5. In view of the limitations, outside his control, on operational activities in Honolulu, Subject's performance has been more than satisfactory and is rated as proficient.

Wheeler effectively assumed his duties as Chief of Base, DO/Honolulu in early January 1965. During the ensuing three months, he has devoted himself primarily to housing, cover, establishment of liaisons, and the orientation of his two outside people. Although he has begun to work on his operational program (directed at the recruitment of WUENVOY candidates), he has not been at work long enough to provide a basis for any evaluation of his operational performance.

SUBJECT:

DCB: 4 October 1915
Halo
G3-15
Deputy Chief of Station
Tokyo
Annual Report For the Period 1 April 1963 - 31 March 1964

In preparing this memorandum in lieu of submitting Fitness Report Form 45, I can only set forth my yearly reiteration that Subject is a senior, well-experienced, wall-motivated, high caliber KUBARK officer who has been in his present grade, 03-15, since 1957. His high standard of contribution to the Station as its Deputy Chief of Station continuos unfailingly. Tokyo Station operations encompass a broad spectrum of internal and external targets emphasizing denied arca operations. To keep on top of this activity it needs a man of energy backed up by sound operational knowledge and Subsect has carried this job capably and with a will. I would certainly grade him "S" in performance evaluation.

Tokyo Station is widely dispersed and I have urged Subject on several occasions to get out to the various operational clemonts in an attempt to get closer to and stimulate the working care officers. After one or two starts he has not kept this up on a continuing basis, remaining at his Embassy desk and invariably working through the individual branch chiefs. I am convinced more effort on his part in this field could have resulted in more yield to the Station from his long area and operations experience.

Subject actively participates in the operational review and budget preparation of the. Station and has shown a definite cost consciousness.

Subject'e long tenure in Japan and experience with things Japanese are well-known and the pro's and con's of the value of an officer remaining in one area for the major portion of his tine with KUBARK (possibly to the detriment of his career) have been discussed to a sufficient degree as to rule out further reference in this memorandum. Subjectis scheduled to leave the Japan Station and enter an assignment where his operational talents will be of groat value.

In any considerations concerning Subject being conducted by any personnel board or by any official of the Agency interested in KIPARK personnel, the significant points are Subjectis a deeply motivated, highly capable officer who has been in his current grade too long.

9 October 1962-31 March 1963

Robert P. Wheeler

A review of the file reflects that has been constantly rated as a well-motivated, superior officer always willing to spend the "extra effort" by a variety of supervisors. During the rating period there has been no diminution in the caliber of professionalism or in the time and effort this man has contributed to the work of the Tokyo Station. He is a distinct asset. Over and above his drive and professionalism, brings to the Station a full background concerning intelligence activities having been associated with such activities in Japan for the last seventeen years, either with the military or as a member of the Agency. All of this time he has been in Japan except for a period of almost three years in Washington.

has a proficiency in the Japanese language and due to his long tenure in Japan has contacts at a variety of levels.

In sum, the Agency has in a superior officer with long background and continuity in Japan, who can and is making a highly significant contribution to the Agency's objectives in Japan.

The above has stressed solely ability to contribute to KUPARK objectives in Japan. However, there is no doubt in the rater's mind that could perform in a superior manner no matter to what geographical area he was assigned.

JUN 1 2:52 PM '61

Subject is a superior officer in every important respect. He is intelligent, imaginative, resourceful and has balanced judgment. He understands administrative procedures and knows how to manage room work. As a supervisor, he is firm and fair, and achieves the respect of his subordinates. As a subordinate, he is unfailingly loyal and helpful. He has a good overall grasp of the intelligence business and maintains a healthy attitude of common sense with respect to operations. He is especially useful in Japan, because of his great knowledge of and long experience with Japanese affairs, personalities and psychology, yet I consider he would be a superior officer and supervisor in any other context. His personal character is of the best.

## SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions mode to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

This is the first Fitness Report made by Rating Officer on Subject since the latter assumed duties as Deputy for Operations, Tokyo Station. He has worked out extremely well in this role. He is intelligent, energetic, hard-working and faultlessly loyal. He pays attention to detail while remaining mindful of larger considerations. He is effective as a supervisor and commands the willing allegiance of his subordinates. He has excellent judgment in both administrative and operational matters. Because of his extensive background in Japan, his knowledge of things and people Japanese and his fair-to-good command of the language, he is particularly well suited for his present position. However, he would be an asset to any station or element of Headquarters in a high supervisory position.

This report has been prepared in accordance with FE Division standards which recognize the principle of rating the individual against the group. Thus an 'average' rating reflects an entirely satisfactory performance.

Subject is a well-seasoned, imaginative operations officer, who is extremely practical in his approach to operational situations. He is especially fine in his dealings with people whether superiors or subordinates. He did an excellent job as a member of the FE Division Staff in improving and expediting the FI and CI activities of the Division. Subject has an excellent background in all things Japanese and is extremely adept at building rapport with his Japanese counterparts.

This report has been prepared in accordance with FE Division standards which recognize the principle of rating the individual against the group. Thus an "average" rating reflects an entirely satisfactory performance.

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

His greatest strength is a warm and engaging personality, an unabashed friendliness that secures him an immediate willingness to cooperate from the people with whom he deals. He is an extremely hard worker, an accurate and meticulous reporter, has energy and enthusiasm and is generally sound in his judgment. On occasions he demonstrates a lack of depth in his assessment of a situation which leads him to jump too quickly to conclusions based on intuition and emotion. As the facts assert themselves, however, he can be ready to revise his opinions. As his knowledge of the Agency and operations continue to grow, however, this tendency should diminish.

SECTION D. SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

DIRECTIONS: Take into account here everything you know about the individual...productivity, conduct in the job, pertinent personal characteristics or habits, special defects or talents... and how he fits in with your team. Compare him with others doing similar work at about the same level.

1. CLEARLY SUPERIOR-HE SHOULD BE PROMOTED

2. OF DOUBTFUL SUITABILITY...SHOULD NOT HAVE ASSIGNED HIM IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW

3. A HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE EMPLOYEE...SELDOM ATTRACTS BUT WITH NO DISADVANTAGES SUFFICIENTLY OUTSTANDING TO WARRANT SEPARATION

4. OF LOW SUITABILITY-AS MOST PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE ORGANIZATION

1/5

5. A FINE EMPLOYEE... HAS SOME OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS

6. AN UNSUALLY PROMISING PERSON IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION

RATING

NUMBER

Is this individual suites for work in some other position in the organization? [X] YES [] NO. If YES, indicate fully.

Although he is perfectly capable of conducting his current job with distinction, he would shine in any position involving liaison with the U.S. military in which his long experience in dealing with military men and his personality could be brought to bear.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Fitness Report on Robert P. WHEELER

1. The attached Fitness Report should be read with the following facts in mind. The Rating Officer arrived in the Japan Station on 21 January 1956. Mr. Wheeler left Japan on or about 19 March 1956 and was in the United States on TDY until 8 May 1956. From 8 May until he left Japan PCS on 7 June 1956, Mr. Wheeler was unassigned in the Japan Station. While the Rating Officer was Chief of Operations, Japan Station, Mr. Wheeler was in his assigned position simultaneously for less than one month and it is my underetending Mr. Wheeler did not report to Mr. Hecksher, but directly to the Chief of Station.

2. I question, therefore, whether Mr. sheeler was under the Rating Officer's direct supervision for a sufficient period of time to insure that the attached report is a completely equable one. Inasmuch as the Chief of Station reviewed this report and made no comment, I am in no position to take issue with it, but suggest that it be viewed in the context of other Fitness Reports on Mr. Wheeler.

SECTION IV
OFFICE OF PERSONNEL

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the Left... then check the category on the right which best tells how that statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means that you have no definite opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in general to PH-56 hot people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. Each Category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions as you so desire. Look at the statement peu tca the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have a definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual..

SECTION Iν

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job of assignment. *MAJOR ROOM* words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks: these are to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left, then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

SECTION V

A. WHAT ARE HIS OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS?
Subject has the outstanding ability to do a remarkable number of jobs remarkably well. He performs brilliantly and rapidly, if sometimes superficially, and completes a prodigious amount of work, meeting deadlines, and at the same time, unless deeply disturbed, maintaining a humorous and kindly attitude toward his associates that makes him almost always exceptionally pleasant to deal with. He is extremely well suited for almost any phase of intelligence work.

B. WHAT ARE HIS OUTSTANDING WEAKNESSES?: Subject tends at times to become elated or depressed to the extent that he sometimes loses his ability to make a carefully balanced judgement. When, as happens very rarely, he runs up against what he believes to be stupidity or serious incompetence, his strongly emotional reaction sometimes hampers a necessary working relationship. He is occasionally a little too easily swayed, like a weather-vane, by the opinions of his superiors. Some of these characteristics are, however, at times actually advantageous in his work, and are far overbalanced by his out-

(When Filled In)

High capacity for competant and rapid accomplishment in almost any intelli- field, particularly as based on his long residence and interest in Japan.

OFFICE OF PERSONNEL

FEB 9 10 31 AM '55

Subject has excellent balance in supervising others, but often requires guidance and direction in something in which he personally is closely concerned.

ROOM-

T&P courses; refresher course in KUPIRE techniques.

Subject makes an invaluable contribution through his knowledge of Japan, and through the continuity resulting from his willingness to remain for an indefinite period in the area.

SECTION VI

2. BARELY ADEQUATE IN PERFORMANCE ALTHOUGH HAS HAD SPECIFIC GUIDANCE OR TRAINING - HE OFTEN FAILS TO CARRY OUT RESPONSIBILITIES COMPETENTLY.

5. A FINE PERFORMANCE, CARRIES OUT MANY OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES EXCEPTIONALLY WELL.

6. PERFORMS HIS DUTIES IN SUCH AN OUTSTANDING MANNER THAT HE IS EQUALLED BY FEW OTHER PERSONS KNOWN TO THE RATER.

4. HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE ORGANIZATION IS INDIFFERENT...HAS "WAIT AND SEE" ATTITUDE... WOULD LEAVE IF SOMEONE OFFERED HIM SOMETHING BETTER.

5. TENDS TO HAVE FAVORABLE ATTITUDE TOWARD ORGANIZATION, MAKES ALLOWANCES FOR RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY WORKING FOR ORGANIZATION. THINKS IN TERMS OF A CAREER IN THE ORGANIZATION.

7. HAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC ATTITUDE TOWARD THE ORGANIZATION WILL PROBABLY NEVER CONSIDER WORKING ANY PLACE BUT IN THE ORGANIZATION.

DIRECTIONS: Considering others of this person's grade and type of assignment, how would you rate him on potentiality for assumption of greater responsibilities normally indicated by promotion.

1. HAD REACHED THE HIGHEST GRADE LEVEL AT WHICH SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE CAN BE EXPECTED.

2. IS MAKING PROGRESS, BUT NEEDS MORE TIME IN PRESENT GRADE BEFORE PROMOTION TO A HIGHER GRADE CAN BE RECOMMENDED.

3. IS READY TO TAKE ON RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE NEXT HIGHER GRADE, BUT MAY NEED TRAINING IN SOME AREAS.

4. WILL PROBABLY ADJUST QUICKLY TO THE MORE RESPONSIBLE DUTIES OF THE NEXT HIGHER GRADE.

5. IS ALREADY PERFORMING AT THE LEVEL OF THE NEXT HIGHER GRADE.

6. AN EXCEPTIONAL PERSON WHO IS ONE OF THE FEW WHO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR RAPID ADVANCEMENT.

1. DEFINITELY UNSUITABLE - HE SHOULD BE SEPARATED.

2. OF DOUBTFUL SUITABILITY...WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED HIM IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW.

3. A BARELY ACCEPTABLE EMPLOYEE...DEFINITELY BELOW AVERAGE BUT WITH NO WEAKNESSES SUFFICIENTLY OUTSTANDING TO WARRANT HIS SEPARATION.

4. A TYPICAL EMPLOYEE..ME. DISPLAYS THE SAME SUITABILITY AS MOST OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE ORGANIZATION.

5. A FINE EMPLOYEE HAS SOME OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS.

6. AN UNUSUALLY STRONG PERSON IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION.

# Supplement to Staff Agent Personnel Action

For , Effective 25 October 1964

Mr.

Dear Mr

In view of your contemplated cover assignment, you have been designated a Staff Agent. The purpose of this Supplement is to call your attention to existing policies which are particularly material to you while you are so designated and to set forth certain obligations incident to your status as an appointed employee.

1. Payroll Administration. As indicated in your Staff Agent Personnel Action, your present salary and grade are $20,245.00 per annum and G3-16, respectively. As an appointed employee of the Government you are entitled to receive and retain only the salary, allowances and other benefits applicable to that status. However, procedural variations will be followed to preserve the security of your position.

(a) The gross emoluments that you receive from your cover activities will be retained by you as an offset against the gross emoluments due you from this organization. If cover emoluments ever exceed those due you from this organization, the overage is to be remitted to this organization on a monthly basis, unless a different period is specified.

(b) Federal income taxes will be withheld, reported and paid in conformance with Agency procedures designed to protect against the unauthorized revolation of your true relationship to the Government. You will be briefed thereon prior to your departure.

(c) This organization will deduct from the gross payments due you an amount equivalent to six and one-half percent (6 1/2%) of your gross salary for contribution to the Civil Service Retirement Fund. This amount will be deducted from the differential due you by this organization. If there is no differential or if it is insufficient, you will be required to make direct remittances to this organization in satisfaction of the required contributions.

(d) This organization will not reimburse you for mandatory Social Security deductions if such deductions are required by virtue of your cover employment. However, when for compelling cover, security or operational reasons this organization determines that you must ostensibly participate in a fringe benefit program of a cover facility you will be reimbursed therefor by this organisation in an appropriate manner. In such event any benefit received by you, your heirs or any other party as a result of your ostensible participation therein while a Government employee is the property of the Government and will be disposed of at such time and in such a manner as this organisation may require.

ATTACHMENT TO FIELD REASSIGNMENT QUESTIONNAIRE:

Re Paragraph C - Preference for Next Assignment:

1. I would like to state that while a tour at Headquarters should be my preference I believe that for me to leave my current assignment at this time for even one year would not be in the best interests of either KUMARK or ODYOKE. Therefore, I request home leave, with approximately one month at Headquarters for requested training and refresher work and one month of leave, returning to current assignment for at least an additional two-year tour with the proviso that after the first year the situation be re-examined with the ultimate view of possibly at that point considering a two-year tour at Headquarters.

2. In my years in work on Japan, approximately ten of which have been spent consecutively in Japan, I feel that I have been able to provide a certain degree of intelligence continuity which could be speiled by a two-year break. Realizing in the future, I believe that, despite possible reflections against my career, that two year period should be delayed until (a) KUBARK is better established in Japan and (b) the Japanese governmental and economic situations are on more stable grounds. I believe that I can play a major role in both those situations, not because I have any special talent to offer out simply because I have the continuity which KUBARK as such lacks in Japan.

3. I believe that by experience, training and inclination I can better serve KUBARK in this country in the type of work in which I am now engaged than by any other assignment currently.

# NARRATIVE EVALUATRON REPORT

Name:

Period Covered: 1 June 1953 to 1 June 1954

Occasion for report: Annual X; reassignment of reporting officer proposed reassignment of employee reported on ; covering initial 90 days of employment

Employee is to be rated upon following factors:

1.  Knowledge of the job being performed.
2.  Judgment in arriving at logical and workable solutions.
3.  Dependability, not only in being on the job, but in accomplishment of assigned tasks within reasonable deadlines.
4.  Stability under pressure and ability to adjust to changing conditions and circumstances.
5.  Imagination, initiative, and originality.
6.  Security consciousness.
7.  Tact and diplomacy in dealing with others.

IN FAIRNESS TO EMPLOYEES, COMPLETED NARRATIVE EVALUATIONS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH EMPLOYNE CONCERNED

1.  Employee is well qualified in substantive fields concerning Japan and the long background of FEC Intelligence activity in this area. This knowledge serves him exceedingly well in the performance of assigned duties. What knowledge he lacks concerning KUBARK policies or procedures is fast being supplied by practical field experience.

2.  His judgment at arriving at logical solutions is good under normal conditions, and he generally comes up with solutions which are workable and realistic.

3.  He is completely dependable and is particularly sensitive to deadlines, which he makes almost a fetish of meeting. In every sense of the word, he is a man of action in terms of treating with the recurring problems of the station.

4.  Employee is somewhat excitable and emotional and, thus, at times of unusual pressure, he may require a steadying hand. This is not a serious fault and is one concerning which the employee is aware. He adjusts well to changing conditions and situations.

5.  His imagination, initiative, and originality have shown time and again in his dealings with Army personalities in PM with whom he has maintained excellent relations on behalf of this Station.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 220

CODENTIAL RYST

6.. Security consciousneos is excellent.

7. Tact and diplomacy in dealing with others is superior.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 221

1. While theo Leviowing Officer concurs generally with statements made in this report, it in folt that the over-all impression does not give Subject much credit as he deserves. In the opinion of the Fevioving Officer, Cubject's faulto are somewhat ever-emphasized. Subject's qualities as ozhibited during past months have proven to be outstanding, particularly in his excollont Judgemont in arriving at logical and workable solutions and in his stability under operational exigencies in which Subject has porformed excoodingly well undor heavy pressures of both time and responsibility.

2. Working in an area where, in the past, there has buon an unfortunato number of misunderstandingo betwoon KUFL and KJGCN components, and where thoro have been the usual difficult personality conflicts, Subject has exhibited not only superior tact and diplomacy, but has also been able to smooth out marry difficulties, and molify aggressively offensive actions. He has supplied a needed cooperative spirit and sense of humor to prevent, in many casse, serious antagonisms and unnecessary vituperation co detrimental to a smooth working organization. Subject's contribution to bringing about a friendly, cooporative rolationship within the mission and with outaldo agencies including U.S. military organizations cannot to praised too highly.

DISPATCH NO, PJJA-1279

DATE: 17 AUG 1953

TO: Chief, FE

Through: Senior Representative, Tokyo

FROM: Chief, JCU

SUBJECT: GENERAL- Administrative - Personnel

SPECIFIC: Commendation of Mr. Robert P. WIEZIER

1.  The purpose of this dispatch is to make a matter of record the excellence of performance of duties demonstrated over the period of his first ten months of assignment to JCU.

2.  During that time has shown himself to be a valuable addition to KUPARK as a whole and a great asset to this particular station. As JCU Chief of Staff, he has performed innumerable tasks in the operational, intelligence and support fields with effectiveness and dispatch. His aggressiveness, imagination and initiative in spite of recurring frustration have been an inspiration to all members of JCU. His diligence and selflessness have set an example throughout the ranks. From the first day of his arrival in JCU, has dedicated his every effort to improving the efficiency and broadening the capability of the station.

3.  should be especially commended for his unceasing efforts in connection with the provision of new office space for this organization. Working tactfully but aggressively through the Army hierarchy here in Tokyo, he was able to accomplish many concessions of direct benefit to JCU which would have been most difficult to obtain through official channels.

4.  Special mention should also be made of the excellent progress made in the fostering of truly cooperative and productive relationships with the various intelligence elements of the Far East Command. Capitalizing on a wide range of friends and former associates and combining a large portion of common sense and patience, may be credited with the development of highly profitable JCU relations with military organizations in the area.

5.  has shown no task to be too large or too small to deserve his range of energy and talent. He has been a vital factor in the accomplish-ments of JCU to date.

## PERSONALITY TRAITS UNIT ACTIVITY

1.  Ask the students to do a self-inventory of their own Personality Traits. They should ask themselves such questions as: "Am I a Perfectionist", "Am I Optimistic?" or "Am I Introverted?"

2.  After students have brainstormed their own Traits, assign them into small groups. In these groups, the students should discuss what they think the definitions of certain traits are. For example, "What does it mean to be *optimistic*?"

3.  The students should then brainstorm people they know (Family Members, Acquaintances, Celebrities, Public Figures, etc.) that are defined by certain Personality Traits. For example: "A person who is *cautious* is the character of Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol." or "A person who is *pessimistic* is the character of Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh."

4.  After the groups of students have compiled their lists of Traits and people who embody these Traits, discuss as a class. The teacher should ask a few groups at a time to come up to the board and write their findings. After the information is written on the board, the class should then discuss and revise what each group has contributed. For example, "Does the class agree that Eeyore is *pessimistic*?"

5.  Have the students come up with reasons *why* certain people have their Traits. For example: "Eeyore is *pessimistic* because he is always left out by his friends." or "Hamlet is *melancholic* because his father has just died."

6.  This exercise should encourage the students to be more conscious of *why* people have their Traits and *how* these Traits affect the characters as a whole.

7.  The Personality Traits that the students use can come from a pre-arranged list that the teacher has prepared, or they can be found through active reading and research of Literary books and articles.

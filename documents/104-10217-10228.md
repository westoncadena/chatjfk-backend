CONTACT REPORT

25 January 1963.

TIME/PLACE : Safe House $2, 1000-Jan 25

FRESENT : Tulpa, Tipteft, Lavion,

1. Purpose of this meeting was to inform Kulpa that Headquarters had agreed to his trip to the Congo and to page contact instructions re Mcinturff. L. said that he had not as yet received instructions from Halden and that the latter planned to be in Rome on Saturday. He would send the airline ticket from that city. L. also stated that Sarge Michel had agreed that the first six covers on the revue Afrique Revolutionaire (f) would be shot by K. K. He hit us up for a light water since he said that his present one was broken and since he had to take
   pictures prior to his departure for the Congo which he anticipated would be either early or mid next week,

2. Another twist was that he had been contacted by Gibson, who informed him that a certain Dave Katts who runs a highly respect sheet in New York City had written to Gibson asking him for photos: Gibson will purchase and forward several of K.'s negatives. Since all this is vague though, Kulps promised to get more facts.

3. The rest of the meeting was taken up by Tipteft straightening out his accountings.

a. Next meeting. 1000 Tuesday 29 Jan.

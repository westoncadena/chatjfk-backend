1. FYI, SENIOR KUDOVE OFFICIALS ONLY, A STRIKE FORCE OF CUBAN REVOLUTIONARIES

HUGERINI 1200, INVADED CUBA BY SEA 17 APRIL AT COCHINOS BAY, LAS VILLAS PROVINCE.

AFTER THREE INITIAL BEACH HEADS WERE SECURED, AGAINST LITTLE OPPOSITION, THE GOC

SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING AIR SUPERIORITY USING T-33 JET TRAINERS AND MIG8'S.

BY 18 APRIL UP TO 12 SOVIET-BUILT TANKS WERE BROUGHT INTO ACTION.

2. THE REBELS LOST ONE BEACH HEAD ON 17 APRIL AND THEIR REMAINING FOOTHOLD

ON 19 APRIL. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THREE FACTORS:

(A) INABILITY TO RESUPPLY WITH PROP A/C IN FACE OF ENEMY JET AIR SUPERIORITY.

(B) INABILITY TO WITHSTAND HEAVY TANK ASSAULT ON A BEACH COMBAT ZONE.

(C) OVERWHELMING ENEMY MAN POWER.

3. THIS STRIKE FORCE WAS THE MAIN REBEL EFFORT DURING THE PERIOD 16-20 APRIL.

4. NO RELIABLE DATA THIS DATE RE REBEL WOUNDED, CAPTURED, OR KILLED. BEACH

HEAD WAS COMPLETELY OVERRUN BUT LOCAL TERRAIN SUCH THAT INDIVIDUALS OR SMALL

GROUPS MAY HAVE INFILTRATED INLAND.

5. 000 POLICE ACTION, INCLUDING ARREST OF THOUSANDS, EFFECTIVELY PREVENTED

CIVILIAN ACTION IN SUPPORT INVASION.

4. In addition to the "category II" items, there are a number of additional subjects largely geographic in nature for which the DCI feels CIA should assume responsibility for preparing comprehensive papers. In view of the apparent adversary relationship between the Senate Select Committee Staff and the agencies under investigation, it may be that preparation of papers dealing comprehensively with specific subjects will deflect some of this cross-agency probing and result in a positive solution to problems before they arise.

5. The Chairman reminded the group of the responsibility which exists to keep Mr. Cotter of the Post Office Department informed on matters resulting from the Congressional investiga- tions which will clearly impact on his agency's affairs. At present, the cross-agency character of the interviews now under way indicate a possible communication gap in adequately coordinating on postal matters.

6. The Chairman explained the DCI's action taken in late May to separate the responsibility for CIA's response to the Congressional Select Committees from those responsibilities of the IC Staff. [Both Dr. Clarke and Mr: Elder emphasized the very close relationship which exists in the two efforts. Mr. Elder will represent CIA at all USIB Ad Hoc sessions henceforth.]

7. The Chairman questioned Mr. Elder, the CIA repre- sentative whether or not the Senate Select Committee had yet furnished the Agency with a list of subjects with which they plan to deal in depth. Mr. Elder reported they have not yet done so, but it is apparent that three items are of priority interest at the moment: assassinations, the Phoenix program, and covert action; that it appears clear the Committee is currently pursuing the question of authorities, approvals, and support from other agencies.

8. The 27 May request addressed to the DCI covering materials under the jurisdiction of a number of Community agencies was provided to the members of the Ad Hoc Group. [Dr. Clarke indicated he was seeking policy guidance on selected items in the request which dealt with Community product such as NIE etc.] He noted the 27 May request indicated identical: letters were being forwarded to the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. Copies have been sent to all USIB Ad Hoc members, the NSC and the White House.

# CONFIDENTIAL

9. Copies of a memorandum which set forth the action items resulting from the Policy Steering Group session of last week were provided to the Ad Hoc members for their information.

10. Mr. Elder reported that the House Committee has indicated to CIA its intent to concentrate on specific issues, but as of now are not adequately organized to be specific in their requests. The one extant request forwarded to the CIA was posing some problems because of the lack of cleared personnel, approved storage facilities, and determinations on the ultimate disposition of records. The Chairman noted that concurrent with this meeting, a meeting of Community legal representatives was taking place with the purpose of commenting on the House Select Committee's proposed security regulations which have not yet been adopted.

11. [CIA reported its success with the provision of a reading room for SSC Staff at CIA headquarters.] State reported there were no comparable facilities anticipated there. Defense has provided badges to Staff members and reading facilities are available. The same accessability of materials is true at NSA and FBI.

12. The last subject on the agenda was the implementation of the Community Central Index. In the material provided to the group was a letter reaffirming the purposes of the Central Index and a list of 40 key words to be used in identifying material furnished the Index. A printout of the Index content was provided to the group as a review document only. The final format of such periodic reports has not yet been refined. Group members are encouraged to comment if they detect any problems with items in the printout. Forms for inputting information to the Central Index were also provided to the Group. This is a service of common concern which will assure the uniformity of information received and should serve to lighten the workload of the individual agencies. The telephone number of Mrs. Young of the Central Index was provided for agencies' convenience in accessing the Index information.

## Memorandum

TO: Mr. W. R. Wannally

FROM: W. Weregar

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

DATE: 6/6/75

This records the results of contact with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) concerning release to Senate Select Committee (SSC) of two documents pertaining to Appendix C, Paragraph 24 of the SSC request to the Department of 5/14/75, which requested "all memoranda and other materials reflecting conversations, contacts or 'communications between the FBI and the CIA on the subject of the establishment or creation of 'notional' Marxist-Leninist organizations withinthe United States."

No information has been developed indicating this Bureau conferred with CIA regarding the establishment or creation of a Bureau-sponsored "notional" Marxist-Leninist organization. Although the FBI did, in fact, direct several such organizations, no information has been developed indicating the FBI consulted with CIA regarding their establishment or creation.

In one instance, CIA advised in 2/70 it had established a notional organization with post office box addresses in Boston Massachusetts and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This notional organization, to be known as the Union for the Revolution, had the objective of developing penetrations and/or sources in revolutionary Arab groups in the Middle East. It was CIA'S intention to circulate propaganda from the post office boxes in anticipation of interesting Arab groups. Thereafter, it was CIA's plan to use its personnel under "suitable" cover to contact the Arab groups. (See memorandum dated 2/13/70, captioned "Union for the Revolution," 100-456409-2, copy attached.)

By letterhead memorandum dated 3/23/70, the FBI indicated information had been received indicating the Union for the Revolution had been in contact with a domestic Marxist-Leninist organization requesting literature. This memorandum set forth an analysis of a "Statement of the Union for the Revolution" indicating the document lacked credibility as a revolutionary document. (LHM dated 3/23/70, captioned "Union for the Revolution," 100-456409-4, copy attached.)

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62-116395

On 6/6/75, Mr. Walter Elder, CIA, advised that CIA
had no objection to the LHM dated 3/23/70, being furnished to
the SSC. With regard to the memorandum from Mr. Papich to
Mr. Brennan dated 2/13/70, Mr. Elder requested that the name
of the CIA representative who furnished the information in the
memorandum be deleted from line one of the memorandum prior to
its being furnished to the SSC. Provided this is done, CIA has
no objection to this memorandum being furnished to the SSC.
He suggested that when the name is deleted, it be replaced with
the phrase "A CIA officer."

ACTION:

To record CIA's clearance of the above-described
documents.

Appendix C, Ш, 24

Please provide: all memoranda and other materials reflecting conversations, contacts, or communications between the FBI and the CIA on the subject of the establishment or creation of "notional" Marxist-Leninist organizations within the United States.

No information has been developed indicating this Bureau conferred with CIA regarding the establishment or creation of a Bureau-sponsored "notional" Marxist-Leninist organization. Although the FBI did, in fact, direct several such organizations, no information has been developed indicating the FBI consulted with CIA regarding their establishment or creation.

In one instance, CIA advised in 2/70 it had established a notional organization with post office box_addresses in Boston, Massachusetts, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This notional organization, to be known as the Union for the Revolution, had the objective of developing penetrations and/or sources in revolutionary Arab groups in the Middle East.. It was CIA's intention to circulate propaganda from the post office boxes in anticipation of interesting Arab groups. Thereafter, it was CIA's plan to use its personnel under "suitable" cover to contact the Arab groups.

(LHM dated 3/23/70 captioned "Union for the Revolution, " 100-456409-4, copy attached.)

As the Union for the Revolution was strictly a creation of CIA, it is recommended before any information be disseminated outside the FBI relating to this organization, clearance be obtained through CIA.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

reason and for the reason that the Director desired to be cooperative with the Committee, we would request a meeting with Senator Church and Senator Tower to arrive at an understanding as to procedures. I told Mr. O'Connor that I would consider such a letter and he said he would discuss the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and with James Wilderotter at the White House.

At approximately 9:05 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor called me and said that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Wilderotter and the Deputy Attorney General. He said that both had agreed that it was inopportune at this time to seek special guidelines for interviews of FBI personnel and former personnel with the Committee. He said that a meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, May 27, 1975, at noon in a final effort to resolve an understanding with Committee representatives. He said at the present time it is proposed that the meeting be attended by Wilderotter and Roderick Hills, representing the White House; Hoffman, representing the Defense Department; (Warner, representing CIA) and O'Connor representing the Justice Department. Committee representatives would be Schwarz, Chief Counsel, and John Elliff. He said that at this time it was his thought that the Deputy Attorney General and I should not attend the meeting. He gave as his reasoning the thought that "should something go wrong" the Deputy Attorney General could disassociate himself from any agreement arrived at, and that I would similarly be in a position of saying that we have not been a party to the agreement.

I reminded Mr. O'Connor that meetings have been held frequently in the past and that tentative understandings made at such meetings have dis- appeared shortly after the meeting was concluded. I told him that was significant to us because we now understand that two more former employees of the FBI have been contacted and may be interviewed in the near future. I told him that former SA Sam Papich and former Agent Nichols have been contacted. I told him that the extent to which we should release these two former employees from their obligation of secrecy could not be intelligently evaluated unless we knew the subject matter of the interviews and that we plan to contact the Committee to inquire as to the subject matter. I pointed out to him that such pending interviews make it imperative for the FBI to consider action in addition to meetings that may be planned to discuss guidelines.

# 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

Office Memorandum * UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: Chief, Contact Division
ATTR: Support Branch
DATE: 31 August 1962
FROM: Chief, New York Office

SUBJECT: Robert Pratchett/Cuban Counterrevolutionary Group, Alpha-66

1.  We came in contact with a new source who will be a continuing one,
    known as Robert A. Pratchett, a US citizen with 27 years experience in
    Cuba who is currently in direct contact with a Cuban counterrevolutionary
    group in the US known as Alpha-66, and who is also in contact with anti-
    Castro Cubans working in Havana. He will give us more detailed information
    during the coming weeks, and represent to us the ambitions, operations
    and proposed sabotage activities of Alpha-66 so that they can either be
    controlled, encouraged or discouraged, as the case may be from the
    viewpoint of those interested in Cuban action groups.

2.  Bio data on Prachett, for any prior clearance or interest in
    him, based on what he may present to us for consideration, is as follows:

Date & Place of Birth - 31 Oct 1918, Havana, Cuba (US citizen by birth)

Education - University of Pennsylvania, 1940

Employment - 1961 - Present H. H. Pike Co., New York and Havana
1958-1960 Brando and Co., Havana
1946-1958 Paramount Pictures International, Havana
1941-1945 US Army (Rank of Major)

Present Address - 35 Walton Ave., New Providence, New Jersey

3.  Prachett, who appears to be a mature and loyal US citizen, is
    interested in being of the best possible service to the US Government in
    a non-pay status, in assisting where he can in terms of his detailed
    knowledge of Cubans, Cuba, and the Spanish language, which he speaks
    perfectly. Other than observing the plans of the Alpha-66 group as a
    potentially successful sabotage group, he is not affiliated with any
    counterrevolutionary group, but is now in business for himself as a
    private investor in a firm he owns and operates, called/PREFIXT Business
    Forms Inc., 60 East 42nd St., New York. He indicated that Alpha-66 plans
    were to blow all the power plants in Cuba.

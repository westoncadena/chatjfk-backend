4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

On 4 February 1972, Raymond R. Leal, ILT, 459-78-6563, Platoon Leader, 164th Military Police Company (MPC), Milsau (NCA), Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), APO New York 09059, and Ronald A. Margulies, SP4, 220-48-5408, Senior MP, 164th MPC, were interviewed separately regarding an incident of possible Counter-Intelligence interest, and both stated substantially as follows:

On 3 February 1972, Sources were in the Lord Nelson Bar, Datteln (LC8424), FRG, with other members of their unit, 1LT Wood and an unidentified Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO), when they were approached by the Disc Jockey of the bar, who introduced himself only as John, and asked them if there was a particular song they would like to hear. After playing the record requested, John walked back over to Sources and sat down with them. John began asking them military related questions almost as soon as he sat down. John asked them what unit they were from. He wanted to know where they came from and where they were going. He asked them why they were in Datteln. John stated that he knew who the Security Sergeant at C Team, 66th USA Artillery Detachment, Datteln, APO New York 09078, was. When John did not receive the answers to his Questions he stated that he knew what they were doing in Datteln. John stated that Datteln was a dead town, but that things were hoping in Westkirchen (MC3549), FRG. The site that the convoy had just come from. John then listed every site the convoy had just come from. John identified the sites by unit designation, location, APO number, and telephone number of the orderly room. John was completely accurate in every detail. John stated that he knew what they had brought to Datteln and knew how long they were going to stay. John talked about how easy it was to get information out of people by using indirect questions. John said that about four years ago he had a Lieutenant that was supplying him information about the site at Datteln. John then boasted that he could find out anything he wanted to by giving ten beers to almost any German soldier at the site. John stated that he did not have any bugs so Sources and their friends did not have to worry about what they said. John was very interested in the jeeps in the parking lot near the Lord Nelson. John said that the jeeps had poor radios and that he had a transmitter/receiver about one foot long, three to four inches wide, and about six inches high, with a three foot antenna that could reach Brazil. When asked where such a radio could be purchased, John said that it was a special model and could not be bought anywhere. John mentioned how easy it would be to put a fake bomb into the jeeps and asked Sources if they checked the jeeps before starting them or just got in and started them.

4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

John wanted to know on what frequency the radios operated. John stated that he hated to be a Disc Jockey, that he had more important things to do. John also stated that they had some mighty fine missiles in Soest (MC3813), FRG. John stated that the Russian Army was far superior to anything in Europe. He talked at length about the Russian Army. Sources felt that John was serious about what he was saying and not trying just to make them uneasy. John asked Margulies if he was a CID agent. Margulies replied that he was not. John talked about and named every intelligence agency of the United States. He mentioned MI, OSS, ONI, CIA, CID and the FBI. John said that Israel's intelligence network was far superior to that of any countries' in Europe or that of the United States. John spoke fluent German and English and spoke Spanish and Russian to Sources to prove that he knew how. John said he learned to speak English in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR), and said "we have to learn many languages." John kept asking about Ramstein Air Force Base and stated that he had been to the NCO Club at Ramstein. John said he hated the FRG and that he wanted to go back to the German Democratic Republic (GDR). John stated that he goes to the GDR often and that he has been to Moscow (NCA), USSR. John expounded on how much better it was to live in the GDR. John claimed to have a cousin or nephew, Sources could not recall which, who was a Major in the army in the GDR. John talked about brainwashing at length and how information could be gotten from people without the threat of physical violence. John said that the American Prisoners of War in North Viet Nam would never be the same even after they were released. John stated that his hobby was just listening and looking around. Sources said that they had to go because tommorrow was a busy day and they had field exercises at 0900 hours. John quipped in "Don't you mean that you and the convoy are leaving at 0600 hours?!!, and added that tommorrow whould be a busy day from him also. John mentioned that he had stolen something and had sold it. John described the object in great detail, as to size, dimensions, and color, but never said what it was. Sources could only recall that it was about one and a half feet long with fins on the end. Sources thought from the description that John gave, that he was talking about a mortar projectile or some kind of small rocket. When Sources left the bar at 0430 hours, they waited for John outside the bar, but he did not come out. They then proceeded through the parking lot where their jeeps were parked to their hotel across from the Lord Nelson. At 0515 hours, Margulies looked out of his hotel window and saw John leave the Lord Nelson. John proceeded directly to the jeeps in the parking lot

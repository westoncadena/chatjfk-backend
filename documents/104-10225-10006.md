MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, GS-12 Evaluation Board

FROM : Raymond A. Warren
Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to
Grade GS-13, Daniel Flores

1. Mr. Daniel Flores was recently assigned to OTR as an operations instructor to capitalize on his fine operational record which he developed during his two field assignments in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and in Lima, Peru, and his most recent operational assignment with LA/COG. His overall performance has clearly been characterized by exceptional proficiency and he has been rated by his most recent supervisor as "outstanding" for his handling of a sensitive on-island case and his development and pursuit of Cuban operational leads. Mr. Flores has definite growth potential and clearly meets or exceeds the criteria for promotica to Grade GS-13, a promotion which is most strongly recommended.

2. During the past year Mr. Flores was responsible for handling a very sensitive, and well placed on-island Cuban asset. This asset is probably one of the "messiest and disorganized individuals" with whom a case officer in this Agency has had to contend. However, Mr. Flores clearly demonstrated his fine handling abilities in his manipulation and exploitation of this agent. As a result of his guidance and his ability to effectively debrief this person, Mr. Flores was able to make this asset one of our most productive on-island sources. During the last year this source produced 51 reports on subject matter which often commanded attention at the highest levels of our government.

3. Mr. Flores has shown a remarkable growth potential during the last year. He is determined, persistent, serious, and commendably aggressive. He is mature, self-assured, and his operational decisions are sound. His managerial skills are in keeping with his operational potential. He was often called

EYES ONLY

upon in the last twelve months to act as Chief of his section, a GS-14 position. He demonstrated sound leadership qualities by stimulating interest and enthusiasm in his staff. His operational programs were aggressive and imaginative. Mr. Flores' supervisory talents combined with his excellent professional skills portend a continuing and successful career in this Agency.

4. While assigned to LA/COG, Mr. Flores was involved in the spotting, assessing, developing access to, and eventually pitching a Cuban who was the head of Cubana Airlines in a Latin American country. The recruitment pitch was not successful but the details of this operation were handled in the most professional manner. Mr. Flores developed more leads to relatives and friends of Cuban officials during this period than any other LA/COG operations officer. He has native fluency in Spanish and feels "at home" operating in the field. While in LA/COG Mr. Flores was called upon to do a considerable amount of TDY travel since he was on call to meet his on-island asset anytime, any place whenever the agent traveled out of Cuba. In addition to these travels, Mr. Flores did a lot of traveling seeking out and debriefing potential access agents. During this last year he clearly demonstrated his ability to function independently and to assume responsibilities usually reserved for officers much more senior in grade and experience.

5. Mr. Flores was assigned in July 1976 to OTR on a two-year rotational assignment as an operations instructor. Upon completion of this assignment, Mr. Flores will return to this Division to assume responsibilities, either at Headquarters or in the field, commensurate with his demonstrated operational and managerial talents. In recognition of Mr. Flores' outstanding agent handling skills, his overall professional competency, and his obvious growth potential, it is strongly recommended that Mr. Flores be promoted to Grade GS-13.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, OIR/LID

FROM : Walter R. Cox
Chief, ALT Unit

SUBJECT : Completion of Training Report
Trainee: Daniel Flores
Training Program: MURAD

1. For your information and for documentation in Daniel Flores' official personnel file, this memorandum certifies that he received the five-day SAI Persuasion Skills course at an NOCB safesite in Arlington, Virginia, between 11 and 17 August 1976. The instructor was Mr. George Steitz.

2. Briefly, the SAI course is a program in human relations and communications effectiveness on the interpersonal level. It provides the trainee with a framework for analyzing problems usually encountered in supervisory or in agent development, recruitment, and handling situations and with a system for presenting his ideas in a way standing the best chance for success in gaining a target individual's willing acceptance. Flores was an active and most interested participant throughout the program and achieved a good understanding of the basic principles involved. A copy of his course critique is attached for your information.

3. Since Flores is an ALT Instructor, we plan to dispense with the formality of a post-training questionnaire.

# CTR/ALT
Staff
Trained: Mr. Daniel Flores
Instructor: Mr. Steita
August 1976-

TO assist us in making decisions about future SAI training or application, your answers to the following questions will be most appreciated.

1. Do you feel SAI training was helpful to you? (If you choose to do so, please explain why or how.) This course was extremely useful to me. One of the main features of the course - how to perceive the others persons objectives before your own - was of particular interest because, as an instructor it will be one of the main tools I will use in evaluating the level of understanding of each trainee. This experience will also be very helpful to me in my career as a case officer. I can think of several instance where SAI could have helped me turn several failures (recruitment pitches) into successes.

2. Did SAI training provide you with any concepts or tools which can be applied in a practical way to your work problems? To your personal life? Any examples you care to mention?

The benefits that this course will provide for me in my job as an instructor are clear. I am absolutely certain that putting the SAI concept into practice will bring forth not only self satisfaction but career benefits as well. This will also be very helpful to me in my personal life. I can see now that some of the concepts will be put to work immediately.

3. What elements, segments, or aspects of the SAI training were of the most interest or use to you?

The greatest revelation from an operation point of view, was the clarification of perhaps an erroneous idea we have about obtaining our intelligence objectives. I always operated under the belief that the most important thing in my work was to attain my objectives, i.e. the recruitment of an agent. SAI revealed that this is true but it also revealed that it is more important to first considered the target's (agent's) objectives. Once we do this our chances (in my opinion after taking SAI) success would probably increase by at least 90 per cent. If I were to stress one point it would be that more emphasis be placed on dealing with the target's rather than the CO's objectives.

4. Would you recommend SAI training for other of our personnel?

I am sure that many people would be recommended for this training and that all would benefit from it. However, I would strongly recommend that personnel officers be given SAI as a prerequisite to their job. It would certainly help them in dealing with large numbers of different people.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 15

5. What other components or categories of personnel do you believe would benefit from SAI training to a degree making it worthwhile for them to receive it?

6. Please comment, if you have any definite opinion, on the duration and pace of the training: too long/short? too fast/slow? The pace of the course was exellent. However, adding one or two more days would certainly help in putting the SAI concepts into practice by the trainee himself. That is, perhaps a live excercise with a person who is not aware of the training situation. A traince could be tasked to elicit information from an unwitting participant. The use of videotapes and/or movies would help in testing the trainees perceptiveness through the course.

7. Any other comments you may wish to make:

A brief corrent about the instructor. He was definitely responsible for the success of the course. Mr. Steitz showed excellent knowledge of the SAI raterial and throughout the course kept the student's interest alive & by showing tremendous enthusiasm in what he was teaching. The end result of the professionalism that Mr. Steitz demonstrated in the class is reflected in the comments stated here and in the confidance he instilled in re personally.

8. On a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate SAI training in relation to other training you have received froin the Agency? Please encircle applicable number:

| Non-Essential | Slightly Helpful | Generally Helpful | Very Helpful | Essential |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1             | 2                | 3                 | 4            | 5  X      |

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Panel A

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade CS-11, Daniel Flores

1. It is recommended that Mr. Daniel Flores be promoted from GS-10 to GS-11.

2. Mr. Flores is 36 years old and joined the Agency in March 1962. He has successively been a file clerk, translator, intelligence assistant, career trainee and operations officer. He worked part time for several years so that he could obtain his PA degree from American University. This he did in 1967 with his specialty being Latin American Affairs.

3. Mr. Flores, who is bilingual in English and Spanish, has just completed his first overseas tour as an operations officer in Guayaquil, Ecuador. It is on the basis of his very fine performance during this tour that this promotion request is based. Also as a result of his record in Guayaquil, he has been assigned to Lima Station as an operations officer in a position which is rated as GS-13.

4. The Chief of Base, Guayaquil, and the Chief of Station, Quito, both have rated Mr. Flores as "Strong" in his fitness reports and both have stated that his performance in Guayaquil merited a Quality Step Increase. This QSI request is currently being processed and is based on the outstanding job Mr. Flores did in connection with a very sensitive technical operation. He planned the pre-installation aspects, supervised the installation, located the listening post, recruited the transcriber/ secretary and processed all the intelligence which was produced. The intelligence derived from this source has been of consistently high quality and the operation has been described by the Chief of Station, Quito, as the best and most productive of all the operations in Ecuador. Throughout all aspects of the operation, Mr. Flores maintained tight control on its security and avoided any problems in this respect.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Panel (Section C)

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-10, Daniel Flores

1. It is recommended that Mr. Daniel Flores be promoted from GS-9 to GS-10. Mr. Flores has been in his present grade since April 1969.

2. Mr. Flores joined the Agency in 1962. Initially he was employed on a part-time basis in the MI Division while attending American University. He received his AB degree in 1967 and became a full-time staff employee. On the strong recommendation of his supervisors, Mr. Flores was accepted for the Career Training Program which he completed in August 1968. After rejoining the All Division, he was selected for assignment as an operations officer at the Guayaquil Base, where he arrived in May 1969.

3. Mr. Flores has made a most impressive beginning in Guayaquil. He has adapted to new tasks and a new environment with a mature assurance and a professional approach. Shortly after arrival in Guayaquil the base was temporarily depleted of other officers. Mr. Flores carried out the duties of acting Chief of Base in a most commendable manner. His fluency in Spanish and his Latin background have been definite assets in the performance of his duties. His performance to date has demonstrated that he handles his agents securely and productively. Both Mr. Flores and his wife have been well accepted within the local community and they carry out their representational duties very effectively.

4. Mr. Flores has proven to be a competent operations officer. As he further develops through experience and responsibility he should become eligible for rapid advancement. In any case he is already performing at a level higher than his present grade and a promotion at this time is strongly recommended.

# DISPATCH

Chief, WI Division

Chief of Station, Quito

Chief of Base, Guayaquil

ADMINISTRATIVE/PERSONNEL - Promotion for

ACTION REQUIRED: See Below

Approved by CS Career
Service Panel
17 JUL 1970

During the visit of the Chief, WHD to the Base last
November 1969 he mentioned to the COS, Quito and the COB that
the promotion for Flores (from GS-9 to GS-10) would be
forthcoming; he also said this to Flores during a private
meeting. Thus far, however, there has been no notice of the
promotion action. The COS assumes that the delay is related in
some way to the dates set for meeting of the promotion panel
for Flores' grade. If this assumption is not correct, however,
and some further action by the Base is necessary in addition to
the recommendation contained in Flores' last Fitness Report,
the COB would appreciate being advised.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary CSCS Panel, Section D

SUBJECT: Recommendation for the Promotion of Mr. Daniel Flores From GS-05 to GS-06.

1. Mr. Flores has been working in WII/COG and its predecessor groups since 1963. His fitness reports have been consistently good and the comments of his supervisors laudatory. In mid-1965 Mr. Flores was changed from full-time to part-time staff employee in order to allow him to attend American University on a full-time basis. His course of study leads to a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science with emphasis in Latin American affairs. Mr. Flores has made the Dean's List the past two semesters and will receive his degree in August 1967.

2. Throughout his career Mr. Flores has shown himself to be a strongly motivated employee, willing and capable. The calibre of his performance has been consistently good and he has shown steady improvement as he acquired the skills and knowledge of intelligence business. He is reliable and conscientious and we have good reason to expect that he will develop into a very competent operations officer. He will apply for the CT program in September and his application will be wholeheartedly supported by WH/COG.

3. In WII/COG Mr. Flores has served as an Intelligence Assistant in support of CI operations. In addition he has assisted in the training of agents in radio and secret writing communications. Mr. Flores is bi-lingual - Spanish and English - and is adept as an operational Translator-Interpreter.

4. Mr. Flores was promoted to GS-05 on 16 March 1964. He has been performing duties at GS-06 level for the past two years and it is sincerely recommended that he be promoted promptly to GS-06.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Daniel Flores

THROUGH : lHead CS Career Service

SUBJECT : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of each case is made by the individual's Carcer Service. If the Head of his Career Service nominates him for participation in the System, this nomination is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action to me. llowever, if the lead of the Career Service advises that the employee does not meet the basic requirements of HR 20-50 for participation, I have accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board. This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the Sys- tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the Head of your Career Service has advised me that you do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation as a partici- pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the regulation that you are not eligible for designation. This in no way affects your current status under the Civil Service ketirement System, nor does it preclude reconsideration of your cligibility to participate in the CIA Sys- tem if you should meet the requirements for designation in the future.

3. Should you desire further information concerning the requirements for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that your read paragraph e of HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination made in your case may have been incomplete or inaccurate regarding your actual employment history with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligi- ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact officials of your Career Service. They are familiar with the details of your case and will gladly discuss them with you. In addition, you may wish to dis- cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 205, Magazine Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions you have regarding your cligibility, you may request that your case be for- mally considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be made within 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Clandestine Services,
Career Services Panel

SUBJECT: Mr. Daniel Flores -
Recommendation for Promotion

1.  Mr. Flores has been with the Agency for about eighteen (18) months and has been a member of SAS since June 1963. During the six (6) months he has been with SAS he has demonstrated intelligence and initiative. In addition to his fulfilling his primary responsibility as a translator, he quickly picked up the knowledge and experience necessary for an Intelligence Assistant in the Operations Support Section. His duties and responsibilities accordingly have been broadened. He has demonstrated ability to function independently as a member of the Operations Support Staff. He is cooperative and has maintained a cheerful disposition under presure and through many late hours and weekends of duty.

2.  In view of his excellent performance in SAS, his intelligence and ability, and his growth potential for a career in CIA, I strongly recommend that ho be promoted to GS-5 as soon as possible.

Mr. Flores had just been recently released from active duty with the USMC when he came in for interview. He has served two tours which included Security guard Embassy duty in Peru and Boliva. His wife was formerly stationed at the Embassy with Dept. of State. He appears to be a mature young man, clean cut, neat appearance, dark complexion and coloring. He is planning to continue his college education at C.U. and is available to work the 8:30 - midnight PI shift. A clerical position at the 08-4 level was discussed in the interview. His wife is a secretary with a law firm in town; they have no children.

Mr. Flores is in excellent health and had a very good record with the Marine Corps. Known of nothing in his background that would be unfavorable in event of reference check. At initial interview he stated that he had no foreign connections, however, after contacting his family in Texas it was determined that his step-mother was born in Mexico and although she came to the US in 1922, she has never become a US citizen.

Full clearance.

# CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
WASHINGTON 25. D. C.

Applicant Information
Sheet No. 1

To all persons applying for employment with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the conditions stated below:

General Considerations:

1.  The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the Agency the responsibility:

a. "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the departments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national security;

c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the Government ;

d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished centrally;

e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security Council may from time to time direct."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 60

The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agency to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which may be different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Government departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive responsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a time-consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks, includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, and availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered. This is called "clearance" of an applicant.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware, perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are conclusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants are not cleared.

Statement of Understanding
and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Considerations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considerations.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

SIGNED at Washington, D. C., this day of September,

1961.

4. SECTION C - NARRATIVE COMMENTS.

SHORTLY BEFORE THE DEPARTURE OF THE FORMER COS, HE SUBMITTED A SPECIAL MEMORANDUM ON SUBJECT'S PERFORMANCE (MEXICO CITY 50702) WHICH CONCENTRATED MOSTLY ON SUBJECT'S RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE CI FIELD. A COPY OF THIS MEMORANDUM IS AVATI ABLE IN SUBJECT'S PERSONNEL FILE. THE UNDERSIGNED FULLY ENDORSES THE LAUDATORY COMMENTS IN THAT MEMORANDUM, BUT SINCE SUBJECT HAS TAKEN ON BROADER RESPONSIBILITIES, IT IS NECESSARY TO COMMENT ON OTHER ASPECTS OF HIS WORK.

FOR THE PAST MONTHS, SUBJECT HAS BEEN DIVIDING HIS TIME AROUT EQUALLY BETWEEN HIS CI RESPONSIBILITIES AND OTHER STATION OBJECTIVES, PRINCIPALLY THE CUBAN TARGET. SUBJECT WAS GIVEN THESE ADDITIONAL DUTIES BECAUSE THE CI OPERATIONS GROUP IS WELI ORGANIZED AND REQUIRES LESS DIRECT C/O INPUT, AND ALSO BECAUSE, OF THE NEED TO DEDICATE ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES AGAINST THE CURAN TARGET. THIS STATION IS ONE OF FOUR WITHIN THE DIRECTORATE WHICH HAVE BEEN SELECTED FOR A CONCENTRATED EFFORT AGAINST CUBA, AND THIS TARGET NON RANKS NUMBER ONE AMONG THE STATION'S MANY PRIORITY OBJECTIVES. SUBJECT'S PAST EXPERIENCE IN CUBAN OPERATIONS, HIS ABILITY TO PASS AS A MATIVE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND HIS OTHER STRENGTH'S, WERE THE INGREDIENTS WHICH THE STATION NEEDED TO EXPLOIT IN THIS EFFORT.

SUBJECT HAS TAKEN OVER THE PRINCIPAL STATION OPERATION DIRECTEO AGAINST CUBA. THIS WAS A FAIRLY NEW OPERATION AT THE TIME IT WAS ASSIGNED TO SUBJECT AND IT WILL MATURE UNDER MIS DIRECITON. FOR REASONS OF SENSITIVITY, A MORE DETAILED REVIEN OF SUB.IFCT'S NORK ON THIS OPERATION CANNOT BE PROVIDED, BUT THE RECORD SHOULD NOTE THAT DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS, HE HAS HANDLED THIS OPERATION IN A THOROUGHLY PROFESSIONAL MANNER WITH STFADY PROGRESS BEING MADE TO FULLY EXPLOIT THE OPERATIONAL AND REPORTING PUTENTIAL. ALSO DURING THIS REPORTING PERIOD, SUBJECT, RENEWED CONTACT THROUGH HIS OWN EFFORTS WITH A FORMER HEPORTING ASSET WHO HAD DRIFTED ARAY FROM COLLABORATION WITH THE ORGANIZATION. SUBJECT IS NOR ATTEMPTING TO BREATH NER LIFE INTO THIS OPERATION AND BRING IT BACK UNDER CONTROI.

SUBJECT ALSO COOPERATED WITH ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY IN ATTFOPTING TO RE-ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH A LOCAL CUBAN

OFFICIAI DURING THE TARGET'S VISIT TO THE BORDER AREA. SUBJECT
HAS IN CHARGE OF COORDINATING THIS OPERATION WITH LOCAL LIAISON
AND WITH THE OTHER AGENCY. THE OPERATION MAS SUCCESSFUL FROM
THE POINT OF VIEW OF ARRANGING A MEETING WITH THE TARGET, BUT
SINCE THE TARGET'S RETURN TO THE CAPITAL CITY, HE HAS REFUSED
EFFORTS BY SUBJECT TO CONTINUE CONTACT.

ANOTHER EFFORT AGAINST THE CUBAN TARGET UNDER SUBJECT'S
RESPONSIBILITY INVOLVES THE RESOURCES OF THE SPECIAL CI
OPERATIONS GROUP. FOR SOME MONTHS NON, THIS GROUP HAS BEEN
TRYING TO MOUNT A SENSITIVE FI COLLECTION EFFORT AND PROSPECTS
REMAIN FNCOURAGING THAT THIS EFFORT WILL SOON BE OPERATIONAL.
THIS IS A FAIRLY COMPLEX UNDERTAKING WHICH REQUIRES PATIENCE
AND AN FLEMENT OF GOOD LUCK IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SUBJECT
DESERVES CONSIDERABLE CREDIT FOR THE PROGRESS MADE THUS FAR
AND IF EVERYTHING GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN, THIS OPERATION SHOULD
BE PRODUCING WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

APART FROM HIS WORK AGAINST THE CUBAN TARGET, SUBJECT
WAS SUCCESSFUL IN RECRUITING AN ACCESS AGENT AGAINST A CHINESE
OFFICIAL AND LATER WAS ABLE TO ESTABLISH CLOSE RAPPORT WITH
THE OFFICIAL HIMSELF. FOLLOWING UP ON A LEAD FROM ANOTHER
SOURCE THAT A LOCAL NATIONAL HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH
A CHINESE OFFICIAL, SUBJECT USED HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE AND
APPEARANCE AND RECRUITED THE LOCAL UNDER THE GUISE OF BEING
A MEXICAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL WHO WANTED TO MONITOR THE
ACTIVITIES OF THE CHINESE IN MEXICO. ASSESSMENT INFORMATION
OBTAINED FROM THE NEW SOURCE GREATLY FACILITATED THE ABILITY
OF SUB.IFCT TO ESTABLISH CLOSE RAPPORT WITH THE CHINESE OFFICIAL
ONCE CONTACT WAS MADE. SUBJECT WAS ABLE TO DISCERN THAT THE
TARGET WAS POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE ON SEXUAL GROUNDS, BUT
TIME DIO NOT PERMIT THIS VULNERABILITY FROM BEING EXPLOITED
BEFORE THE TARGET COMPLETED HIS TOUR AND DEPARTED THE COUNTRY.
STATION REGRETS THAT A LEAD TO THIS TARGET HAS NOT IDENTIFIED
EARLIER. BUT THIS DOES NOT DETRACT FROM THE PROFESSIONAL
MANNER IN WHICH SUBJECT EXPLOITED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH
THIS CASE FORWARD AGAINST AN UNREALISTIC DEADLINE.

THIS REPORTING PERIOD HAS AGAIN BEEN ONE OF CONSIDERABLE
ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF SUBJECT IN WHICH HE HAS DEMONSTRATED
MIS TAIFNT FOR OPERATIONS AND PARTICULARLY HIS ABILITY T0

GOOD OFFICER (1970-72), I AM STRUCK BY THE REMARKABLE PROGRESS.
HE HAS MADE IN THREE KEY AREAS: OPERATIONAL THINKING AND
ANALYSTS, WRITING, AND SOUND, PROFESSIONAL APPLICATION OF
BASIC OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES.

Mr. Flores came to the Quba Operations Group from a brief assignment to the Office of Training. Prior to the OTR interim, Mr. Flores had been a COG case officer and was therefore familiar with its operational techniques. During this ten-month period under review, Mr. Flores served as a section chief with responsibilities for East Asian stations with a Cuban target (Tokyo, Manila, and Hong Kong) and Canada. Mr. Flores was the only GS-13 officer to hold section chief responsibility, yet his performance compared favorably with that of the GS-14 section chiefs. As a section chief, Mr. Flores was supervisor for two operations officers, one intelligence analyst and a secretary. He was responsible for ensuring the prompt handling of correspondence to and from the field stations, and providing operational guidance and direction on matters pertaining to Cuban operations. His section was managed in a competent manner with Mr. Flores demonstrating his ability to delegate functional responsibilities. The Quba Operations Group also functions in a direct case officer capacity, and Mr. Flores frequently traveled TDY to handle cases. He was the operations officer for one particularly sensitive and productive on-island reporting case. This required him to travel on short notice and to arrange for secure meeting and debriefing sessions of this reporting source.

Mr. Flores also traveled to Canada on various occasions to meet with liaison contacts and participate in developmental operations. One particular recruitment attempt required Mr. Flores to spend several days in a motel room observing the

Subject likes to operate. He is very practical, experienced, and realistic. He is, however, a little quiet and tends to accept things the way they are. While I have no doubt as to his skills, he may need a bit more management experience to learn how to make things move despite obstacles. He has done a fine job running the East Asian and Canada section of Cuba Operations Group.

movements of an operational target, and to devise a secure and timely method of approach to the individual Cuban.

In comparing Mr. Flores' performance as an operations officer and as a supervisor, I believe his perfomance is somewhat stronger in the former capacity. Mr. Flores has all the attributes of an excellent case officer: he is aggressive, thinks operationally, and is fast on his feet in an operational situation. He is further aided by his fluency in Spanish and has on more than one occasion successfully passed himself off as a Mexican businessman. During his TDY travels, he has repeatedly demonstrated dedication to the job at hand, willingness to work long hours, and a flexibility to handle all types of situations.

Mr. Flores is less enthusiastic when it comes to the paperwork and bureau- cratic requirements of his position, while he is a good writer, he tends to handle his written tasks in a hurried manner and consequently, his work oftentimes requires review. He is also inclined to take the shorter and easier approach when handling the paper flow requirements. I mention these points not because they represent basic shortcomings, but simply to contrast them to his exceptionally high performance in his operations officer capacity.

In sum, Mr. Flores is an extremely experienced, competent and well motivated operations officer. His talent as a "street operator" with a keen sense for the human target has been amply demonstrated. He has now quite successfully been introduced to his first supervisory position and proven that he is competent for assignments of this nature. I believe Mr. Flores is capable of handling positions of increasing responsibility and should be given the opportunity to do so.

Mr. Flores joined the Agent and Liaison Training Unit in mid-June 1976 and after a week's familiarization with training materials, aids and office routine of the Unit, he attended a two-week Instructor Training Workshop at the Special Training Center. On completion of the Workshop, Subject returned to the Unit for further familiarization with the routine of the Unit, assisted in several surveillance problems, and monitored a two-week training program which included active participation as a trainee himself in the SAI (or persuasion skills) portion of the program. Subsequently Mr. Flores assisted as a role-player in a brief but significant program involving the training of a prominent U.S. citizen assisting the Agency in southern Africa. Mr. Flores then assisted another instructor in devising and conducting the first program this Unit has undertaken designed to teach surveillance awareness/detection to Staff Employees who are deemed likely to be subjects of terrorist surveillance and attack.

I concur in the ratings on specific duties and on the overall rating of STRONG for Mr. Flores. Although he was assigned to this Unit for a short period of time, he was proving to be a well qualified operations instructor. His home Division requested his return in order to give him a responsible position for which he was well qualified, and he should do well on that assignment.

niques for a U.S. citizen who is scheduled to serve as an NOC
Officer in the Caribbean.

The first independent training task given to Mr. Flores
was of a third-national field agent serving as an access agent,
but this task was cancelled at the last minute when the con-
cerned Base discovered grounds for field termination of the
agent rather than providing tutorial training for the agent in
the U.S. Mr. Flores was justifiably irritated at this turn of
events which denied him what held promise for being a challeng-
ing initial training program.

It was with regret that we learned, early into what turned
out to be Mr. Flores' only independent training program, that
a priority requirement of his home-base Division would necessi-
tate his return to Division duty soonest. The Division agreed
to our request that Mr. Flores conclude the training program
he had tailored, and begun, and Mr. Flores is to be commended
for having done an exceptionally fine job in this assignment.
The completion-of-training report was also well organized, and
the questionnaire which asks for an evaluative follow-up from
the trainee's field Station is to the point.

Farly in his assignment Mr. Flores took over the mainten-
ance and improvement of the Unit's operations training slides,
consolidated them into an extremely functional package, and
solicited ideas from other instructors to improve the package.
Much to his credit and the Unit's benefit, Mr. Flores managed
to persuade another Agency component to undertake--without
charge--a major revamping of some of the slides using computor-
designed art work to replace some of the less impressive early
work in this field.

THIS IS THE INITIAL REPORT WRITTEN ON SUBJECT AND COVERS A PERIOD OF SEVEN AND ONE-HALF MONTHS SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN MEXICO IN FER 78. SUBJECT HAS BEEN IN THE ORGANIZATION FOR OVER 16 YEARS AND SERVED TWO U/S ASSIGNMENTS PRIOR TO MEXICO CITY.

HIS PRIMARY DUTY IS TO SUPERVISE THE OPERATIONS OF A CI UNIT COMPOSED OF PERSONNEL SUPPLIED BY LIAISON BUT WHICH IS UNDER THE OPERATIONAL DIRECTION OF THE STATION. THIS PARTICULAR UNIT REPRESENTS THE NUCLEOUS OF THE STATION'S CI OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. IT IS ALSO A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO STATION'S EFFORTS DIRECTED AGAINST THE HARD TARGETS IN THE FI FIELD. SUBJECT PARTICIPATES IN ALL LEVELS OF ACTIVITY WITH THIS UNIT FROM THAT OF A MANAGER TO SERVING AS AN OPERATIONS OFFICER. THE LEADERSHIP AND EXAMPLE WHICH HE SETS HAVE BEEN AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IN THE SUCCESS ENJOYED BY THE UNIT IN RECENT MONTHS. IN APRIL 1978, THE STATION UNDERTOUKAN AUDIO OPERATION DIRECTED AT THE OFFICIAL OUT-OF-TOAN RETREAT OF A PRINCIPAL ADVERSARY IN MEXICO. SUBJECT PARTICIPATED IN THE RECRUITMENT OF A CARETAKER WHO PROVICED ACCESS TO THE TARGET INSTALLATION AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE OPERATION EXCEPT THE ACTUAL INSTALLATION OF THE TECHNICAL DEVICES. THIS SUCCESSFUL OPERATION WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER ONE THE FOLLOWING MONTH, THIS TIME DIRECTED AT THE HOTEL ROOMS OF A VISITING COMMUNIST DIGNITARY. TWO VALUABLE REPORTS WERE PRODUCED FROM THIS OPERATION ON THE POLICIES AND PLANS OF

A FOREIGN COMMUNIST PARTY. IN JULY, SUBJECT SUPERVISED THE RECRUITMENT OF AI. AGENT WHO HAS ESTABLISHED ACCESS TO A HOSTILE OFFICIAL INSTALLATION. A TECHNICAL OPERATION IS NOW UNDERMAY TO EXPLOIT THE SOURCE'S ACCESS.

This officer has worked under my supervision for approximately six months. This is the first fitness report I have prepared on him. After two field tours and his current assignment to Cuba Operations Group, he has developed into a solid and professional operations officer with the skills we hope our employees will develop. He is now highly motivated and creative in his work. He has demonstrated, particularly in recent months, a gratifying degree of drive and interest.

He has handled one of our most productive and sensitive on-island assets. With his guidance this agent has produced, within the past six months, some of the highest quality intelligence on Cuban plans and intentions this Agency has obtained. Because this agent must be serviced via TDV travel, the responsible case officer must be able to work with very little guidance and have the tradecraft skills and reports writing ability to work largely on his own. With this case Mr. Flores has demonstrated himself to be a first-class agent handler, highly attuned to operational information and quality intelligence production.

As Section Chief I have relied upon him heavily to provide the institutional memory our work demands. He has full grasp of all operations directed against Cuban officials, not only in those countries under his direct responsibility, but throughout Latin America. Since all of the officers in this section travel frequently to meet and debrief agents, Mr. Flores has frequently acted as Section Chief during the absence of the other two officers, a GS-14 position. He has been able to handle the job well both.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I agree with the ratings given by the rating officer.. Mr. Flores is indeed a fing operations officer and should have an exceptionally successful career in operations. The only weakness in him that I have ever noted is an occasional lack of drive and self-motivation and as noted by the rating officer, particularly in recent months, he seems to have cured this and has indeed been going at a fast pace.

Mr. Flores is leaving Cuba Operations Group for a rotational tour in the Office of Training. I believe that when he finishes this tour, he should return for an operational assignment in the Latin America area. He is an exceptionally fine case officer, has a native command of Spanish, and has a way of dealing with his agents that gets the most out of them. Aiture tours for him should involve supervision of younger case cofficers and he should begin to move into the managerial aspects of grerations.

SECTION D

in terms of paper flow and personnel administration. He demonstrates
an ability to advance further along these lines. Also during the
period under review he participated in an approach against the
local head of Cubana Airlines in a Latin America country. Although
the recruitment effort was not successful, it was conducted in a
professional manner and Mr. Flores used an access agent relative
in a very effective manner.

He has been perhaps the most aggressive officer in the Cuba
Operations Group in pursuing leads for interviews of relatives,
friends, and acquaintances of Cuban officials posted abroad.
During the period under review he conducted at least six such
interviews and developed good assessment data on various targets.

As a native Spanish speaker, Mr. Flores has the ability to
pass as a foreign national and has successfully carried out roles
as a Mexican citizen, using OTS-provided false documents. This
ability to pass as non-American has been of great assistance in
handling the key case he relinquished only on leaving LA/COG.

Mr. Flores has now overcome an earlier reluctance to be
aggressive which former supervisors might have noted. I am
confident he will maintain and build further on what I have found
to be a highly improved sense of enthusiasm. I am sure he will1
be a strong contributor to his new component.

No. 3

He is an officer who merits further responsibility and one who
should continue to rise in rank as he assumes these additional
responsibilities. It has been a pleasure to work with him and
I should like to do so with him in the future.

## SECTION D NARRATIVE COMMENTS

OFFICE.OF.PERSONNEL

LA/COG is both a Headquarters AzordBo75 and an active operational "station" operating out of Headquarters, responsible for recruitment operations and agent handling. As such, Mr. Flores assignment is a combination of Headquarters desk chief and case officer of a large field station. His performance is being rated in both capacities which means that much higher criteria is being applied than for most Headquarters officers.

Mr. Flores has proved to be a professional agent handler, and has been used very effectively in two new, sensitive operations run from Headquarters. Although he did not participate in the recruitment of these sources, Mr. Flores was brought in to provide initial training, and detailed guidance necessary to develop the new assets into reporting sources. One was a complicated case of a DGI walk-in who Mr. Flores helped debrief, then trained and dispatched back to Cuba. The other was a successful false flag recruitment of a source with excellent access to the Cuban leadership; Mr. Flores' job, after being introduced by the recruiting officer, is to make the source into a fully controlled asset and maximize the excellent potential for intelligence information.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

LA/COG has six operations officers performing duties similar to those assigned to Mr. Flores--Case officer responsible for recruiting/ handling agents directed against a hard target and also staff duties as a Desk Chief. These tasks are unique within the Latin America Division as these officers serve as field case officers and also as Headquarters desk officers. All on-island Cuban agents are handled by these six employees. I would rank Mr. Flores in the middle of this group, but it must be taken into consideration that all the other officers are senior in grade.

Continuation of Section D

His professional, no-nonsense handling has already contributed to highly significant information (a value quotient of 7.0 with one XX report) on some of the Agency's current Cuba priorities including Cuba's negotiating attitude vis-a-vis the U.S.

In his capacity as Desk officer for field stations in Latin America, Mr. Flores is charged with providing guidance and support aimed at recruitment operations against Cuban officials. He has conducted interviews of Cuban exiles in the U.S. and initiated a promising recruitment operation against a well placed third country official in Cuba. He supervises one intelligence analyst and, together, they effectively ensure timely response to field requests and help stations to identify operational opportunities, recruitment targets and--where necessary--keep them aware of the priority of the Cuban target.

By his performance, Mr. Flores has demonstrated he is a versatile case officer with good operational instincts; he is showing increasing agressiveness and imaginative support of field stations in their efforts to recruit Cuban officials. While he is an excellent agent handler who gets maximum intelligence production from his assets, he is less thorough when handling the administrative details involved in his operations. He needs more supervisory experience, and still tends to rely excessively on his IAs to search for operational leads and conduct operational research.

Mr. Flores was sponsored by the Division, and attended the mid-career course in November 1974. He has excellent potential for further advancement in the Division and has been a significant factor in LA/COG's success over the last year in developing access to Cuba, a recognized hard target.

Continuation of Section E

Subject excels as an agent handler motivating his agents and disciplining them when required to obtain quality intelligence. He handles two of LA/COG's most sensitive on-island agents and during this period, he has met these two agents in Europe and in Latin America. He has certainly targetted these two agents against priority objectives and the intelligence produced has been of vital interest to U.S. Government policymakers in this delicate period of Cuban nego-tiations. Latin America Division has received commendations from


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

Continuation of Section E

the intelligence community for reports acquired through Mr. Flores.
Subject's staff duties include desk chief responsibilities for support
and guidance to field programs including the research and targetting
required to conduct an effective recruitment program. Although such
duties requiring supervision are new to him, he is also making
progress in this capacity. With proper guidance and assistance, he
will develop into a most effective supervisor.

Mr. Flores native fluency in Spanish and his Latin background
have proven most valuable to Cuban operations. In fact he represents
himself as "Latin American" in handling one of this agents. For an
officer his grade, he is very mature, self assured, has good common
sense and is certainly a professional. Subject has completed two tours
in the field and is an experienced ops officer. He is intelligent,
imaginative, uses good tradecraft at all times and has a clear headed
approach to the business. He expresses himself well orally and in
writing, and works very well with other case officers. Mr. Flores
keeps up to date on political, economic and social affairs pertaining
to Cuba and he willingly accepts difficult tasks requiring frequent
separations from his family.

Subject definitely has potential. He is operationally agressive
and is gaining experience as a manager. Mr. Flores is already perfor-
ming at a higher level than his grade. In approximately a year, he
should be again dispatched to the field as a senior officer responsible
for handling Soviet, Chinese or Cuban targets. During the next
reporting period, Mr. Flores should receive training in superivsion.
He is a solid performer in the Cuban Operations Group and has contri-
buted much to our successes during the past year.

In a very short time, Mr. Flores has become an important factor in LA/COG's efforts to directly handle Cuban on-island agents, and to expand its recruitment program. His fluent Spanish, past operational experience, versatility and ability to blend into the local scene in most Latin American countries, make him highly qualified for his present assignment. He demonstrates sound operational judgment under often trying conditions, and good ability to communicate effectively both orally and in writing. His frequent TDYs demand long and unusual hours, which he gives ungrudgingly.

Almost immediately after his assignment to LA/COG in March 1974, Mr. Flores was called upon to handle a sensitive walk-in case. The agent had already been recruited and many of the developmental aspects of the case had been resolved prior to Mr. Flores' introduction, but it still required a Headquarters based case officer to provide the necessary continuity wherever the agent surfaced overseas. The case is complicated and time-consuming, involving extended TDYs and utmost adherence to good tradecraft procedures. It has developed into one of our most productive sources of information on Cuban clandestine

I concur with the rating officer's comments and performance evaluation. Soon after his arrival at LA/COG, Mr. Flores took over the handling of a sensitive agent. While the agent's bona fides had already been established and his modus operandi determined, considerable ad hoc judgement and direction were required to continue the agent's motivation and ensure his viability. Mr. Flores did extremely well in his guidance of the agent in a series of complicated, extended meetings which took place in several LA countries. Good, professional tradecraft and sound judgement were exhibited by Mr. Flores.

activities in Latin America, due largely to Mr. Flores' professionalism.

Mr. Flores' current assignment is a combination of operational and Headquarters desk responsibilities, the latter calling for the support of field stations in their efforts to develop individual Cuban recruitment programs. His extended TDYs have understandably prevented Mr. Flores from devoting much time to his desk responsibilities and it is somewhat difficult to judge his performance as a desk officer. He has a good grasp of what needs to be done, and his handling of specific tasks indicates good managerial potential. Nevertheless, he does need additional desk experience, especially in areas which will allow him to use his operational ability to support and guide field stations that are developing Cuban operational programs.

## COMMENTS BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL (CONTINUED)

this aspect of his performance was less noteworthy, and it is believed more attention and research could have been given to this activity. Mr. Flores writes concisely and well, and his CI/CE instincts are sharp and true. He can be expected to turn in a solid desk performance in the future.

Subject's tour in Lima has been cut short by the serious illness of his daughter. As a result of this illness it was also necessary for him to spend the months of December and January on emergency leave in the United States, returning without his family in February in order to transfer his ops workload and pack out his personal effects for PCS transfer to Headquarters on 4 March.

Although the undersigned had the privilege of working with Subject only briefly, as rating officer he had the advantage of taking over handling of most of Subject's cases following the departure on emergency leave. Thus he was able to observe first hand and in detail the human material with which Subject had worked, the progress he had made in developing their access and capabilities, and the respect these agents had for him.

During the period covered by this report, Subject continued his pursuit of the MPCHEEK target as his primary operational responsibility. He developed and recruited a prominent member of the local MPCHEEK community who has good access to the MPCHEEK embassy and handled four other access agents. He also handled a unilateral surveillance team and the Station's press placement assets via a principal agent who in turn handled three sensitive assets.

As the rater makes clear, Subject will be missed in Lima and we can only sympathize with the reasons why he must now leave. He was doing the Station a great deal of good and advancing his own career nicely as well. It is worth recalling that Subject pre-sided here in Lima over what we understand is still a unique operational feat, a staged recruitment approach to an MPCHEEK official. Also, Subject was often used on a variety of operational tasks having little to do with his assigned targets because, in the

Continuation of Narrative Comments

In carrying this heavy workload, Subject demonstrated that he is a superior agent handler. He succeeded in conveying to these people a sense of mission and participation which has kept their morale and motivation, and hence their production, at a high level. He also insisted upon work and security discipline, with a result that the record of these agents in prompt and reliable appearance for meetings and in responding in writing to requirements is extraordinarily good. They all have a clear idea of what is expected of them, confidence that performance will be rewarded and conversely that non-performance will not be tolerated. Just prior to his departure, Subject successfully terminated an entire surveillance team of long standing, a measure which was decided upon simply because the team had been heavily used for over five years and from a security standpoint replacement seemed to be in order. Letting old agents go is always a delicate and usually a thankless task. It takes finesse and bargaining skill. Subject showed these and more in divesting us of the team without a hitch.

During his last month in Lima, despite the fact that he was burdened with the problems of closing out his household and the normal operational and administrative cleanup prior to PCS depar- ture, Subject made two very significant contributions to Station objectives. First, he coordinated with the Peruvian Government the official but necessarily discreet visit of a senior BKHERALD officer. Since the Station is not declared, Subject had to main- tain his LNGOLO cover throughout, further complicating this delicate assignment. During the visit, he coordinated frequently with the head of the Peruvian National Intelligence Service and with the chief administrative aide of the President of Peru. He also participated directly in one meeting with the President. This was of course not the type of assignment which would normally be entrusted to a "Junior officer", but Subject is juntor only in relative grade, certainly not in maturity, self-assurance or judg- ment. Then with only three days left in Lima, Subject led an installation team which entered a building recently purchased by the MPCHEEKS, remained for almost 48 hours and made two apparently excellent audio installations.

The Station will miss Subject a great deal. As the above Incidents demonstrate, when the tough or sensitive assignments came up, he was the officer we turned to most frequently. He never balks, argues inconvenience, or seeks the way out. He is cooperative, helpful, and in a low-key way is always effective. We hope he will not object to the term "old reliable" -- he has been that in Lima, and more.

first instance he was bilingual and could fade into the Lima background. But he would not have been so regarded if he had not shown ample good sense, zeal, and balanced judgment in unfamiliar situations. We hope Subject can get overseas again within a reasonable time and consider that the Station that gets him will be fortunate.

Following realignment of Station officer assignments last year, Subject was given the responsibility for operations against the MPCHEEK "hard target". He also assumed additional tasks in more traditional areas, such as coverage of the local government, penetration of the Communist Party, and press placement activity. The breadth of these operational commitments attests Subject's professional ability and versatility. (This would be a senior case officer's load by any description and Subject's performance at it was the reason behind our recommendation for accelerated promotion last year.) Particularly against the difficult MPCHEEK target, this officer has displayed admirable determination despite the inherent frustrations and disappointments of work- ing against this remote and suspicious group. During the period under review, his job has been the more difficult since the MPCHEEKS, in all probability reacting to a Station attempted recruitment operation (in which Subject played a major role), have withdrawn into a defensive shell which makes access operations verge on the impossible. Nevertheless, he has continued to probe their defenses, and has managed to develop two leads which, with the exercise of patience and application of his proven operational resources, could eventually give us access to the official MPCHEEK Mission here. This officer refuses to become discouraged, a quality officers working on hard targets must have.

Special mention is made of Subject's successful bid to make recontact and establish regular meetings with a valuable penetration of the revolutionary government. The agent had broken contact with his former handler in the belief that such action was dictated by his security situation. Our choice of Subject to attempt to recontact this asset was dictated by his experience in dealing with skittish Latins and our belief that Subject could bring it off with tact, reading the situation /CONTINUED/

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

As described, this officer is a steady and solid performer who carries a major case load securely, productively, and without complaint. He has even volunteered to take on additional work when he has seen opportunities to help the Station's overall mission. Because he blends in well on the local scene, he is often drafted for afl kinds of *ad hoc* operational work. This is invariably well done. He is operationally aggressive but also shows lively awareness of the tricky operational climate here and does not push breyond what the traffic will bear. His agents respect his seriousness, which permits him to get more utility out of them. He is a pillar of this Station.

as it developed, and make appropriate on-the-spot adjustments to control the asset's reactions. All this had to be accomplished with great regard to security because of the sensitive position occupied by the agent. Subject's performance has been effective and, given the operation's importance, can really be called outstanding. The agent is again a prime source on the radical sector of the government, which is crucial to developments locally.

Further, this officer continues to manage an outside principal agent who in turn handles leftists, Communist Party and press placement assets, so directing these efforts that they contribute effectively to overall Station objectives. More recently, Subject has taken over the unilateral deployment of a new audio operation targetted against a senior local Communist Party official and is carrying it through successfully. This officer also handles much of the support requirements for his various operations, including management of safehouse keepers, overseeing a small surveillance team, and acquisition of rental cars and property in alias. There is little doubt that some of Subject's success can be attributed to his Latin background and fluent Spanish. But both of these advantages might be wasted by a less capable all-round officer. In his case, they provide him with complementary skills that enhance his superior performance. In the view of the reporting officer, Subject carries more than his own share here in Lima in a manner normally calling for an officer of considerably more senior grade and experience.

In the period of this report, Subject established himself and his family at this post and undertook the direction of the Station's operations against the subversive left which had formerly been handled by an officer two grades senior to Subject. He has proved equal to the task. He learned his new assignment rapidly and adapted well to the handling of his cases through outside principal agents, a security requirement of the local scene which can be frustrating for an aggressive officer with fluent Spanish such as Subject. However, he has shown maturity and superior handling ability in directing his assets against the subversive left and particularly the Communist labor union. His intimate knowledge of the extreme left enabled him to plan secure contact with a "walk-in" to the Embassy who at first appeared genuine. After thoroughly debriefing this individual, drawing upon his knowledge of the extreme left, Subject was able to recommend no continuing contact with him due to specific fabrications on the part of the walk-in.

He is careful in management of funds entrusted to him for his operations and provides required administrative and operational reports in a timely manner. There have been past comments on Subject's weakness in writing. He has worked hard on this, and the rating officer feels that he is now competently producing the reports required. Subject understands that this is an area that requires continuing attention for a growing professional.

Subject has come up the hard way, both in pushing on to finish his education and in BKTRUST. As a result he is way under-gradod for his maturity and for his operational contributions. That wo have given Subject a major responsibility hore (STPAGODA) attests to how much confidence we have in him and his ability. He is, of course, bi-lingual and mixes well with Latins, an advantage ho uses well. A good "street" operator, he still has a way to go in organizing his paper work and in relating to Hqs needs.

SECTION C continued.....

A comment must be made on Subject's great ability to adjust rapidly to one-time and target of opportunity assignments. His performance in meeting with two high level agents of other stations who had to be met during stays in Peru, and his on-site assistance in an audio operation against a priority target have been of the highest order. No doubt his fluent Spanish greatly assisted him in these tasks, but his experience and good judgment were major factors in his excellent performance in the role of utility operations officer.

To exploit Subject's talents to the fullost, and provide him with the professional challenge equal to his ability, he has now been assigned the management and handling of the difficult Chinese target, a top priority for the Station. This is a true measure of our confidence in him.

Mr. Dantel Flores completed his first tour in Guayaquil and departed the field on 28 May 1971. Following home leave, Mr. Flores returned to Headquarters in August for approximately two months training prior to his next assignment to Lima, Peru. This training included Weapons Familiarization and Defensive Driving, CA, China and Labor Ops. Communist Party, TSD briefings, and on-the-desk Reports Writing Familiarization.

Since Mr. Flores has been on leave or training status for most of this reporting period, no meaningful rating can be given.

There has been little Subject's performance since the submission of his last report covering the period through 30 September 1970.

The highpoint of his activities during this period, as it has been throughout his tour, has been his management of a sensitive technical operation which has been a consistent producer of unique and high level intelligence. This has been a good performance on Subject's part indicative of his professional capability to conduct clandestine operations.

Subject's writing ability has improved during this period, and there is little doubt that his efforts in this regard are paying off. Further experience should see continued improvement of his writing skills.

As Subject's first tour comes to a close he can look back on a generally strong performance in all phases of his operational activity on behalf of the Base's objectives.

I concur in the ratings and remarks of the supervisor. During his first tour abroad, Subject has done very well in his main fields of activity. His outstanding attribute at the moment is his persistence not only in going after operational targets but also in improving himself. He has encountered some difficulty in presenting his ideas in written form but he has faced up to this problem and, as the rating officer notes, has made significant improvement.

Continuation of Comments by Reviewing Official

Subject has a clear-headed approach to the collection of intelligence and is realistic in evaluating potential sources. His fluency in the Spanish language has facilitated his movement in the local community and he has developed several potentially useful sources and identified others.

In considering this officer for promotion, two facts should be kept in mind:

a. He is probably older and certainly more mature than the average officer at his grade level. He is anxious to get ahead and this explains much of his initiative and drive.

b. The rating officer has rated him very realistically which, in my view, adds to the importance of the outstanding rating given him on Specific Duty No. 2.

## Continuation of Narrative Comments

The target is good. The project is, however, in need of good human reporting assets and it is expected that as Subject overcomes a weakness mentioned in the next paragraph he will be able to devote more of his time to this important task.

The Subject has encountered some difficulty in the preparation of written material -- dispatches, intelligence reports -- and finds it necessary to spend an extended portion of his time on its preparation. The rater has discussed this with Subject on several occasions, and it is believed that his difficulty is due to a lack of experience, and that in time and with a continuing effort on his part he will develop his writing skills.

The Subject's overall attitude and response towards his professional responsibilities during the first tour have been positive. He is interested in the kind of work he is doing, likes it and is willing to put in the kind of long hours it sometimes demands without complaint.

## Continuation of Comments of Reviewing Official

of the Base. He responds positively to guidance and direction; he is eager for new opportunities to enlarge his experience and knowledge. He appears to be completely motivated toward the work of this organization; it is a pleasure to have him in Guayaquil.

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness. In the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

The period covered by this report encompasses the middle portion of the Subject's first tour as a Case Officer. His performance during this period has been balanced in that he has shown the kind of intelligence and maturity necessary to successfully carry out clandestine operational activity. He has also shown a weakness which he will need to overcome in order to achieve his full operating potential.

The Subject has turned in fine performance in the overall management of a very important and sensitive audio operation which has been under his care since the pre-installation phase. His sure and careful handling of all succeeding phases of this operation led to a secure, uncomplicated installation, the recruitment and training of support agents, and the dissemination of valuable intelligence information. Subject's natural fluency in the Spanish language has been especially useful in this operation. His handling of this installation has been of a high professional caliber throughout.

The Subject is also responsible for the management of a project targetted against the subversive left. His handling of this project has been good: he is a good agent handler; knows how to target his assets against objectives of most importance; and, his knowledge of

I agree with the ratings. This has been a good year for Subject, one which has given him a rather unusual opportunity to learn many facets of the work of this organization and one in which he has shown a very satisfactory level of accomplishment. Shortly after his arrival in Guayaquil he became, for a short time, the Acting Chief of Base, and through that period and the ensuing change in Base Chiefs, he showed a professional maturity we felt to be exceptional for a young officer on his first tour. He has worked hard and intensely for improvement in the quantity and quality of his operational production, and he has collaborated very effectively with the other officers

disciplined, effective manner enabling him to maintain a continuity and productivity within the Base operational requirements with security and dispatch.

Secially Subject and his wife are proving to be good mixers and both are gaining in popularity within the local foreign and indigenous communities. They both have gained the respect and appreciation of the complex not only as compatible personalities, but in her willingness to participate actively in Joint charitable endeavors and his professional cooperative attitude. Their optimistic and positive conduct at official and non-official functions is a credit to the Base.

Subject's native fluency in Spanish and his Latin background is proving to be a definite asset in the performance of his assigned operational tasks and ability to handle agent assets amicably and productively.

He maintains accurate accounting records and is demonstrating responsible acute cost consciousness in the use of funds and properties.

This rater's principal criticism of this employee is his tendency toward Impulsiveness and too-quick judgement before weighing all the facts and Implications in the pursuit of his operational requirements; however, this weakness is more a function of his inexperience in the field and will be resolved as he gains more field experience..

Subject, although exhibiting resourcefulness and imagination in performing his assigned operational tasks also has a tendency to accept the Judgement of other senior grade officers too readily rather than express his own convictions and trust in his om assessment of a situation.

This rater has conseled this Officer regarding these tendencies and he is taking measures to rectify them.

In Judging his over all performance, this Rater is of the opinion if he continues to apply himself in handling tasks worthy of a senior grade officer, he should be considered for a promotion to the GS-10 level at the earliest opportunity.

This employee, a GS-09, arrived PCS at the Guayaquil Base on 13 May 1969 and has been under this Rater's supervision during this four and one-half month period. Guayaquil is his first overseas assignment with this Agency.

During this short reviewing period, this Officer has demonstrated a marked insight and knowledgeableness of the operations he has been assigned, and has provided a number of good ideas and suggestions for the betterment of these operations. Subject is proving to be a hard worker and has not complained of the many extra hours he has devoted to his operations. He has accepted responsibilities without hesitation and is not afraid to take on difficult tasks using initiative and ingenuity in their completion. This latter quality has been amply demonstrated when the Rater was unexpectedly confined to a hospital in the Panama Canal Zone for the full month of August 1969, leaving this employee solely responsible for the Base as the only inside Case Officer at the Base during this time. Rater's absence corresponded with a change in Case Officer PCS assignments at the Base, which left the Base temporarily depleted of Officers. During this period, Subject exhibited an ability and maturity expected of an officer of higher grade and greater field experience. He organized his increased workload in a ...Continued...

BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

This Officer has made a most impressive beginning in Guayaquil. He has in a few short months adapted to new tasks and a new environment with mature, if modest, assurance and a professional approach which speaks highly for the training and experience he has had. He has taken on, in the absence of the Chief of Base and other senior officers, responsibilities uncommon to an officer of his junior position, and he has handled them in a superior fashion. He and his wife have entered into their representational responsibilities with great enthusiasm and effectiveness, and I predict a most highly successful tour for him in Ecuador. Because he has shown a personal and professional competence beyond his grade level, it is strongly recommended that he be considered for promotion to GS-10 at the earliest opportunity.

Mr. Flores did a fine job while he was assigned, to Chile desk. He had responsibility for a variety of FI projects, including several complex and sensitive ones, which he ably handled. He had a full workload and in addition to his assigned responsibilities he was given FI assignments of every type as they arose. On one occasion he was sent on an operational trip to New York City where he was to contact, assess and support a target personality. Owing to circumstances beyond his control nothing went as expected but Mr. Flores, acting alone, improvised and adapted to the situation. This is indicative of the initiative and eagerness he displayed in his desk work. He was willing to learn and he accepted guidance and instruction to the letter. In addition Mr. Flores writes well and this is always an asset.

Mr. Flores is fluent in Spanish. It is my impression that if there is one thing that Mr. Flores wants to be that is a field case officer. He is now getting that chance. He will soon leave on an assignment to Ecuador. I have no doubt that he will do very well.

Mr. Flores did not have any managerial duties.

Mr. Flores is a part-time staff employee who works a maximum of 19½ hours per week while attending university full-time. In August 1967 he will obtain his bachelor's degree in political science. He will revert to full-time employment upon finishing his university studies and will be recommended to the Office of Training for admission in the CT class beginning November 1967.

The limitations imposed by part-time employment have prevented us from assigning Mr. Flores to jobs within the branch such as the monitoring of active field cases which require close, daily attention. However, he is qualified for this type of duty. His performance in the duties described above is excellent. He accomplishes his tasks quietly and efficiently with a minimum of guidance from his supervisor. Because he is bi-lingual in Spanish and English he is of great use to the Branch in screening quickly and accurately materials which are of counter-intelligence interest.

Mr. Flores agency work background, coupled with his formal education about to be completed and his own desire to make a career in intelligence make him an extremely valuable employee, one in whom the Agency should not hesitate to invest time and money for the advancement of his career training.

Mr. Flores is a part-time staff employee who works a minimum of nineteen hours per week; he is also a full time college student in his senior year, majoring in political science and specializing in Latin American studies. Subsequent comments should be prefaced by the statement that Mr. Flores' overall performance of his assigned duties would be considerably more efficient if he were able to devote full time to his assignment. On the other hand, Mr. Flores is preparing himself academically for a useful career with the Agency and in the rater's opinion shows promise of becoming a very capable and competent officer.

Mr. Flores is bilingual and has served very efficiently as a translator for the Branch. He has gained very valuable experience as a case officer in the handling of two contract agents of WII/COG/CICS, and in doing so has demonstrated tact, sound judgment and a fine ability to handle people. Mr. Flores is very personable, intelligent and makes an excellent appearance, With the completion of his studies he should be able to make the transition from Intelligence Assistant to Junior Case Officer, which the rater heartily recommends.

Mr. Flores has worked closely under my direct supervision in the handling of the two contract employees listed under Specific Duty No. 1 and 2. I concur with the rating of Mr. Castoro and can only emphasize that I believe Mr. Floros will make a good Case Officer and I plan to recommend him for CT status as soon as he is able to be with us full time.

Mr. Flores is a part-time staff employee who works a maximum of 19½ hours per week while attending university full-time. In August 1967 he will obtain his bachelor's degree in political science. He will revert to full-time employment upon finishing his university studies and will be recommended to the Office of Training for admission in the CT class beginning November 1967.

The limitations imposed by part-time employment have prevented us from assigning Mr. Flores to jobs within the branch such as the monitoring of active field cases which require close, daily attention. However, he is qualified for this type of duty. His performance in the duties described above is excellent. He accomplishes his tasks quietly and efficiently with a minimum of guidance from his supervisor. Because he is bi-lingual in Spanish and English he is of great use to the Branch in screening quickly and accurately materials which are of counter-intelligence interest.

Mr. Flores agency work background, coupled with his formal education about to be completed and his own desire to make a career in intelligence make him an extremely valuable employee, one in whom the Agency should not hesitate to invest time and money for the advancement of his career training.

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language com comcerence, if required for current position. Amplity or explainatings given in Section 8 to provide bast basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial brisupervisory dutses must bo described, if applicable.

Mr. Flores was a particularly useful and versatile employee in the WH/SA counterintelligence operations unit. Although he had no operational training or previous operational experience, he learned rapidly and performed well the operational support type duties assigned to him. His fluent knowledge of the Spanish language, his willingness to learn and perform tedious tasks, and his conscientious approach to his work were important factors in his performance. His previous assignments in the RI Division and in WH/SA as a translator and in conducting name traces gave him a good background.

With respect to specific duty #3, on two separate operations in New York City Mr. Flores participated in the training and preparation of agents for dispatch to Cuba. In the first operation he interpreted for training in S/W, OWVL, W/T (medium speed) and related subjects.. The second operation involved OWVL only. This experience enable Mr. Flores to perform duties (specific duty #3.) relating to communications with agents in Cuba.

Mr. Flores plans to continue his university education and attain a degree. Arrangements have been completed so that he may work in the Agency on a part time basis beginning in January 1965. He will attend classes at a local university as a full time student.

Mr. Flores was promoted from GS-04 to GS-05 on 16 March 1964. Не has been performing duties at the GS-06 level, and he should be promoted. (see page two)

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section 8 to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Flores entered on duty with Special Affairs Staff in June 1963. Due to his proficiency in Spanish he was assigned to translating duties and immediately proved to be an invaluable asset to this office as well as to the Staff as a whole. He worked many late hours and weekends helping to facilitate the flow of translations from this office to the different components within SAS. His performance of these duties can best be characterized as "exceptional" in all degrees.

Mr. Flores expressed a desire to move into a position of greater responsibility and this request was readily granted approximately one month ago. He is currently being trained as an intelligence assistant in Ops Support functions and his performance to date has been excellent. In his new duties Mr. Flores requires very little supervision. This can be attributed in part to his degree of intelligence as well as the background he obtained for his present duties while assigned to his previous job in RID/INDEX. Mr. Flores spent approximately one year in his former job and the knowledge he brought with him renting to name tracing procedures has enabled him to grasp the duties of his new position quite rapidly.

As a means of furthering his education Mr. Flores is attending American University at night. He has expressed a desire to obtain some agency training and would like very much to be enrolled in the Intelligence Orientation Course as soon as possible.

Mr. Flores entered the agency as a GS-4 in March 1962. It is strongly recommended that he be promoted at the earliest possible date to a GS-5.

During this reporting period, Mr. Flores continued to conduct himself in the exceptionally proficient manner which was noted 1:41618 Fitness Report. He is one of two name tracers who specialize in a particular arca, a fact which tends to increase the difficulty as well as the responsibility of name tracing. In spite of this burden, Mr. Flores has consistently maintained an above average level of production and an exceptionally high quality in his finished products.

Mr. Flores is a conscientious and highly motivated employee who evidences a sound sense of responsibility. He has frequently voiced a desire to take advantage of any career opportunities the Agency may offer to him. He is currently enrolled as a full-time student at the American University.

From the outset Mr. Flores has shown many characteristics of an above-average employee. His initial training in the intricacies of his duty assignment was marked by a high degree of application, interest, and achievement. Since that time Mr. Flores has proven himself a conscientious and responsible employee, one whose work record is distinguished by a high calibre of quality and quantity.

Because of his fine record, Mr. Flores was chosen one of the three specialists for this section. He specializes in the Spanish-Portuguese area and his work is characterized by exceptional proficiency.

At present Mr. Flores is registered at American University as a sophomore. Inasmuch as he has exhibited both potentiality and strong working habits, I recommend that Mr. Flores be given the Professional Battery Test at the earliest opportunity.

TEST RESULTS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE FACT FINDING PHASE OF MOST PERSONNEL OPERATIONS. EVALUATION OF
THESE MEASUREMENTS IN RELATION TO OTHER FACTUAL MATERIAL IN THE PERSONNEL RECORD PROVIDES ONE OF THE BASES FOR THE
SELECTION AND PLACEMENT OF APPLICANTS AND FOR COUNSELING WITH NEW EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER, THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER
AN INDIVIDUAL CAN AND WILL PERFORM THE DUTIES OF A SPECIFIC JOB MUST REST ON THE JUDGMENT OF THE RECRUITER OR PLACE-
MENT OFFICER, WHO CONSIDERS ALL ASPECTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY, BACKGROUND, AND PERSONALITY IN RELATION TO THE
REQUIREMENTS OF THE AGENCY.

THIS REPORT EVALUATES THE SUBJECT'S PERFORMANCE BY COMPARING HIS SCORED WITH THOSE OF A NATIONWIDE GROUP OF
TWELFTH GRADE STUDENTS OF THE SAME SEX... SPECIFIC APTITUDES ARE IDENTIFIED BY USING A VARIETY OF TESTS RANGING FROM
WORK SAMPLES OF FILING AND CHECKING TO MEASURES OF REASONING ABILITY. IN EVALUATING THESE TEST SCORES FOUR GENERAL
CONCEPTS SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND: (1) TESTS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SCREENING OUT POTENTIAL FAILURES THAN IN IDENTI-
FYING THOSE WHO WILL PERFORM SUCCESSFULLY. (2) PERSONS WHOSE SCORES ARE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE LOWEST 16% ORDINARILY
ARE NOT SUITED FOR OFFICE WORK. (3) MOST JOBS DO NOT REQUIRE HIGH SCORES ON ALL TESTS, BUT HAVE A RANGE WITHIN
WHICH PEOPLE CAN DO THE WORK EFFECTIVELY AND TEND TO REMAIN ON THE JOB. (4) EFFICIENCY IN PLACEMENT NECESSITATES
MATCHING THE JOB AND THE INDIVIDUAL, BOTH THOSE WHO ARE OVERQUALIFIED AND THOSE WHO ARE UNDERQUALIFIED ARE LIKELY
TO QUIT.

A DESCRIPTION OF THE SIX TESTS IN THE BATTERY IS GIVEN ON THE BACK OF THIS FORM. IN CASES WHERE THE PATTERN
OF THE TEST SCORES APPEARS TO INDICATE APTITUDE IN PARTICULAR AREAS THIS WILL BE NOTED IN THE REMARKS SECTION.
WHERE RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE TESTS TO JOB PERFORMANCE THESE COMMENTS WILL
RELATE TO SPECIFIC JOBS. THIS SECTION MAY ALSO INCLUDE A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S POTENTIAL IN RELATION
TO HIS INTERESTS AND BACKGROUND.

SECPET

As noted in below. my first choice for my next assignment is that of Chief of Base in Barcelona, Spain, or Chief of Base in Latin America. I have served three tour overseas and a four-year tour at Headquarters. In Cuban Operations. In the past ten years I have gained experience in technical operation, operations related to the priority and hard targets and, prior to my assignment to Mexico City, as supervisor of one of the four branches in Cuban Operations. In Mexico City my responsibilities consist of the supervision and administration of an 18-man unit composed of Mexican nationals which I manage and direct operationally in co-ordination with the Government of Mexico. I have been in Mexico City fifteen months.

Should the Chief of Base position in Barcelona become available in the summer of 1989 or 1981 and this job is offered to me. I would be

amenable to an extension in Mexico City for a period of 12 to 10 months depending on the timing of the assignment. If I were to be assigned to a country where an additional language is needed, time for language training should be taken into consideration.

In the event that a position as Chief of Base does not become available within the next year or two, my second choice is to be considered for a War College either for calendar year 1980 or 1981. This would enable me to more fully participate in the Agency's rotational program and would provide me with a higher level of training needed for career mobility in the Agency.

My third choice is to be considered as a candidate for the Agency's management program at one of the participating Universities in the United States with the intention of accepting a field assignment immediately after the termination of this training. I am prepared to make all the necessary arrangements toward this end (i.e., applying for admission, etc.) provided a list of Universities is furnished to me.

As noted above, I am willing to remain in Mexico City through the summer of 1981 if my first choice is approved. In the event that my first choice cannot be granted I would be available to return to the United States in the summer of 1980 to prepare for my second or third choice. Should my second or third choice not be granted, I would prefer to return to the United States for an assignment in Washington.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CSCS Panel (Section C)

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-10, Daniel Flores

1. It is recommended that Mr. Daniel Flores be promoted from GS-09 to GS-10.

2. Mr. Flores joined the Agency in 1962; initially he was employed on a part-time basis in the Wii Division while attending the American University. He received his As degree in 1967 and became a full-time staff employee. On the strong recommendation of his supervisors, Mr. Flores was accepted for the Career Training Program which he completed in August 1968. After rejoining the Wii Division, he was selected for assignment as an operations officer at the Guayaquil Base where he arrived in May 1969. Mr. Floros is bi-lingual in Spanish.

3. Both as a Headquarters and field operations officer Mr. Flores has carried out his assignments with intelligence, enthusiasm and initiative. As the Guayaquil Base officer in charge of Communist penetration operations, his performance has been of high caliber. In August 1969, during the forced absence of the Chief of Base and other senior officers, Mr. Flores assumed the full responsibilities for running the base for a period of several weeks. He performed the duties of Acting Chief of Base in a superior manner. In addition to his operational competence, the Guayaquil Chief of Base has observed that Mr. Flores' ability to develop social relations with ease has been a distinct asset for the Base.

4. Mr. Flores has already proven to be a competent operations officer. As he further develops through experience and responsibility he should become eligible for rapid advancement. In any case he is already performing at a level far higher than his current grade and a promotion at this time is strongly recommended.

Supplement to Staff Employee Personnel

Action for Integration of Daniel Flores

Effective 10 April 1969

The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth existing policies of concern to you while integrated and to reiterate certain rights and obligations which derive from your true status as an appointed employee. It is hereby agreed and understood that:

1. As an employee of this organization, at the present grade and salary of 08-9 $8744.00 per annum, you will accept cover employment with another instrumentality of the Government (hereinafter referred to as "your cover facility") effective as of 10 April 1969. You will, insofar as consistent with your basic responsibility to this organization, abide by all the rules, regulations, practices and policies of your cover facility, in order to appear as a conventional member of that establishment. Your appointment to your cover facility is being effected as a PSR-7 at a salary of $8153.00 per annum. You are prohibited, except as specifically authorized herein, from retaining emoluments paid by your cover facility.

2. It is understood and agreed that the minimum period of your overseas tour of duty is governed by and coincident with the prescribed tour of duty of your cover organization. Currently, your prescribed tour consists of a period of two (2) years from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty. Your assignment may be terminated earlier for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organization in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescrited tour of your cover facility. If you requeat termination of your overseas assigment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival at your oversens post of duty, you will not be entitled to return-travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States at Government expense. If you request termination of your oversees assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed one (1) year of cervice from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty you will be required to reimburse the Government for all of its exper.ses for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to the United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consistent with your cover designation, will normally te at the direction of your cover facility. Such travel will be accomplished in confortance with applicable


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 251

SECRET

regulations of your cover facility except when you are directed for operational reasons to perform travel in accordance with the regulations of this organization.

4. Salary and allowances paid by your cover facility shall be retained by you to the extent that they do not exceed the salary and allowance payment due you on the basis of your grade level with this organization. If such cover payments are less than the amount due you, the difference will be paid to you by this organization. If such cover payments exceed the amount due you, the excess amounts will be remitted to this organization at intervals to be designated by the Office of Finance. Computations hereunder will be based on the aggregate gross amounts due and received. That portion of retirement contributions withheld by your cover facility which exceeds the retirement contributions applicable to your organization salary will be deducted from the gross amount of the overpayment. Upon integration, the payroll office of this organization will establish the date on which you would normally receive a regular step increase from your cover facility. Failure to report a grade promotion received from a cover facility does cause errors in processing regular step increases. Regular step increases, incorrectly processed in such manner, should be reported immediately to this organization. To eliminate this problem, any grade promotion received from a cover facility will be reported immediately by you to this organization's payroll office through channels showing both the old and the new rate and the effective date. All salary difference payments and adjustments will be reflected on earnings statements.

5. Your status as an employee of this organization will continue in full force and effect during your period of duty with your cover facility and you will continue to be entitled to all rights, benefits and emoluments of such status. Certain variations in procedure will be required, however, to preserve the security of your cover position.

a. Upon integrating into your cover facility you will continue to be covered by the particular retirement system in which you are a participant as an employee of this organization. Salary received from your cover facility and any salary differences payable by this organization will be subject to appropriate retirement contributions.

b. Appropriate Federal income tax withholdings shall be made from taxable income received from both your cover facility and this organization. Additionally, while serving in the United States, withholdings shall also be made for District of Columbia or State income tax, when applicable. You may claim reimbursement for excess income taxes paid on overt tax returns by reason of taxable income from your cover facility exceeding the taxable income due you as an employee of this organization.

c. All annual and sick leave which is accrued to your credit at the time of integration will be transferred to your cover facility. While integrated you will be permitted annual leave, sick leave, home leave, and leave without pay in accordance with the regulations of your cover facility in lieu of the leave benefits of this organization. Upon termination of your integration, your unused annual leave, sick leave, and home leave will be transferred to your credit with this organization and your leave record will be reconstructed as of the beginning of the leave year in which you return to this organization, as explained in the Handbook on leave for Special Situations. Serving in an integrated capacity does not permit the carryover from one leave year to another of an annual leave balance which exceeds the ceilings authorized by regulations of this organization and the Federal leave law. If security conditions require that your cover facility make a lump-sum payment for accrued annual leave, upon your "resignation" you will be required to pay the gross amount thereof to this organization, including any income taxes withheld by your cover facility in order to receive credit for such annual leave.

6. You will be required to keep forever secret this agreement and all information which you may obtain by reason hereof, unless you are released in writing by this organization from this obligation. Violation of such secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the espionage laws, as amended, and other applicable laws and regulations. The termination of your employment with this organization will not release you from the obligations of any security oath you may be required to take.

Significant strengths and weaknesses and their relationship to overell performance in the Operations Course. This section amplifics and explains, as necessary, the racing letters given above.

Mr. Flores' overall performance in this course was at the high proficient level. He lo a very friendly and personable individual who put forth a good deal of effort to do well in the course. Mr. Flores takes a very practical approach to solving problems and his attitude throughout the course was excellent.

Mr. Flores acquired a good understanding of the principles and techniques of Clandestine Services operations, and in problems requiring face-to-face encounters with simulated agents in the live exercises he came through as a very friendly and personable individual. He was particularly effective in debriefing situations and demonstrated flexibility in meeting the problems that arose during the simulated agent meetings.

Mr. Flores demonstrated a good understanding of Clandestine Services programs in Foreign Intelligence, Counterintelligence and Covert Action. His performance was graded strong in handling of a simulated walk-in defector, and in a Counterintelligence case study and a Covert Action case study his understanding and analyses were Judged highly proficient. He received a rating of adequate in photography.

Mr. Flores has good writing skills and acquired a thorough under- standing of intelligence and operational reporting procedures and formats of the Clandestine Services. His intelligence reports were consistently complete, accurate and clear. His operational reports suffered occasionally from weak organization, and on one occasion he had difficulty distinguishing operational from intelligence information; but his reports were generally complete and accurate and showed a sound understanding of operational reporting requiremento.

Mr. Flores is a personable and intelligent individual who got along very well with his colleagues and with the instructors. With his excellent attitude and strong desire for a career in the Clandestine Services together with his willingness to work hard, Mr. Flores should have little difficulty in developing into an effective cace officer as he gets greater experience.

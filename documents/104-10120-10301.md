1. A request for security approval for State
   certification of Subject has been received from
   OSI, in connection w/30 days' TDY to
   San Salvador, effective immediately.

2. Subject's file is non-derog; however,
   as a former FBI informant State Dept
   appears to have been reluctant to
   consider him for (integration) in 1957. (See
   Col. E's Memo of 21 Feb 1957, in file.)

3. Do you wish to check with State
   prior to O'King a certification for this
   TDY?

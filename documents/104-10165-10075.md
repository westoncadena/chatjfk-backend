# Political Prisoner in Hospital

Cl√©mart Joseph Charles was taken from the National Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince to Haiti's General Hospital. The former Duvalier banker has been jailed since 15.1 "for political reasons" No proper trial was held.

Mr. Charles is suffering from an acute liver infection and the physicians attending him have warned that he will die unless he's allowed to travel abroad for special treatment.

This isn't the first time Mr. Charles was taken from his cell to a hospital. Last year he was rushed to Haiti's military hospital for treatment of the same disease.

Mrs. Charles has been allowed to visit her husband.

This is the first time the Duvalier regime has acted half humanely with a political prisoner. It's been pointed out that Marie-Denise Duvalier Dominique, a friend of Mr. Charles, has often interceded for him.

Army chief-of-staif Jean-Baptiste Hilaire will soon be replaced, say military sources in Port-au-Prince. His likely replacement? Col. Roger St. Albain.

On a lighter note, the General ran for cover on September 22 while there was a review on the Palace grounds to commemorate Duvalier's "election" in 1957. Accidentally the loaded automatic wezpen of a militiaman went off Many officials, General Hilaire among them, scrambled for protection, Jean-Claude, his mother and their body-guard General Gracia Jacques were trembling, but they kept standing, says a-source that was standing close to them.

ACQ 15 October 1974

FIELD NO.

SOURCE A reliable source fron a Haitian exile leader who is well educated and who has a wide variety of contacts in Haitian exile groups. The exile was aware that his information would reach the U.S. Government.

1.  Clemard Joseph Charles, former president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti who has been held political prisoner since April 1970 on charges of plotting against the government, was recently transferred from jail to the general hospital in Port-au-Prince. Charles is said to be dying of cirrhosis of the liver and was transferred to the hospital on orders of Madame Simone Ovide Duvalier, mother of Haitian President Jean Claude Duvalier.

2.  Doctors recommended that Charles be sent abroad for proper medical treatment but me. Duvalier authorized his transfer only to the local hospital. According to close relatives, this occurred only after Minister of Interior and Defense Paul B1 anchet told the President and his mother that he would refuse to become involved in this case and would not sign any papers required of him as Minister of Interior certifying that Charles had died in prison. Relatives of Charles still intend to press for his removal fron the country.

3.  Field Dissen: Sent to Port-au-Prince.

SOURCE A YOUNG HAITIAN EXILE LEADER WHO IS WELL EDUCATED AND WHO HAS
A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTACTS IN HAITIAN EXILE GROUPS. HIS
REPORTING HAS BEEN RELIABLE.

1. ON APPROXIMATELY 20 MARCH 1972 LUCKNER CAMBRONNE,
   HAITIAN MINISTER OF INTERIOR AND NATIONAL DEFENSE, TELEPHONED
   FERMIN JOSEPH, AN OFFICIAL OF THE NEW YORK-BASED, HAITIAN
   EXILE NEWSPAPER "HAITI OBSERVATEUR," AND TOLD JOSEPH THAT HE WAS
   DISAPPOINTED AT THE ANTI-GOVERNMENT OF HAITI (GOH) STANCE
   TAKEN BY THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" IN GENERAL AND JOSEPH IN PARTI-
   CULAR IN THE 18 MARCH EDITION OF THE PAPER. CAMBRONNE STATED
   THAT HE HAD HOPED THAT HIS RECENT INVITATION TO ALL HAITIAN EXILES

WITH JOSEPH, WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE PAPER CAUSE TO RE-EXAMINE ITS
POSITION VIS-A-VIS THE GOH.

2. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE SAME SOURCE REPORTED IN
   TDCS-314/01942-72 THAT DURING A MEETING ON 16 MARCH 1972
   BETWEEN THE TWO, CAMBRONNE TOLD JOSEPH THE GOH CONSIDERED
   THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" AND ITS SUPPORTERS TO BE THE ONLY OBSTACLE
   TO THE GOH'S PLANS TO REUNITE ALL HAITIANS IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD
   A NEW, PROGRESSIVE NATION. AS A FIRST STEP TO RAPPROCHEMENT,
   CAMBRONNE ASKED JOSEPH TO REALIGN HIMSELF WITH THE GOH AND RETURN
   TO HAITI. IF JOSEPH ACCEPTED, CAMERONNE SAID, THE GOH WOULD BE
   WILLING TO NAME HIM TO WHATEVER OFFICIAL POSITION HE DESIRED EITHER
   INSIDE HAITI OR ABROAD.)

3. JOSEPH REPLIED THAT BEFORE HE OR THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR"
   COULD GIVE ANY THOUGHT TO SOFTENING THEIR POSITIONS ON THE GOH,
   THE GOH WOULD HAVE TO SHOW ITS GOOD INTENTIONS THROUGH DEEDS RATHER
   THAN MERE PROMISES. CAMBRONNE THEN INVITED THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR"
   TO SEND A TEAN OF REPORTERS TO HAITI TO SEE FOR THEMSELVES THE
   CHANGES WHICH WERE BEING BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE REGIME OF PRESIDENT
   JEAN-CLAUDE DUVALIER. BEFORE SUCH A TRIP COULD BE MADE,
   JOSEPH SAID, POLITICAL PRISONERS WOULD HAVE TO BE RELEASED. ALSO,

THE "HAITI OBSERVATEUR" KOULD INSIST THAT ANY SUCH TEAM OF REPORTERS
WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY NEWSMEN FROM OTHER NATIONS WHO WOULD
ACT AS GUARDS AGAINST ANY PRESSURE THE GOH MIGHT APPLY AGAINST THE
HAITIAN REPORTERS.

4. JOSEPH ASKED CAMBRONNE WHETHER THE GOH INDEED INTENDED TO
   RELEASE SUCH POLITICAL PRISONERS AS HUBERT LEGROS, CLEMARD
   JOSEPH CHARLES, AND COL. KESNER BLAIN AS CAMBRONNE
   HAD INTIMATED DURING HIS 15 MARCH PRESS CONFERENCE. TO THIS
   CAMBRONNE REPLIED THAT HE CONSIDERED LEGROS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS
   MAN AND THAT HE HAD NO INTENTION OF EVER RELEASING HIM. (HEAD-
   QUARTERS COMMENT: LEGROS, A LAWYER AND SELF-PROCLAIMED COMMUNIST,
   WAS ARRESTED IN MAY 1970 AFTER HAVING BEEN SOUGHT BY HAITIAN
   AUTHORITIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. CHARLES, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE
   COMMERCIAL BANK OF HAITI, AND BLAIN, FORMER COMMANDANT OF THE
   QUARTERMASTER CORPS, WERE ARRESTED IN APRIL 1970 FOR PLOTTING
   AGAINST THE GOH.)

5. CAMBRONNE REITERATED THAT HE BELIEVED THE "HAITI
   OBSERVATEUR" POSED THE NUMEER ONE THREAT TO THE GOH'S PLANS TO
   REUNITE ALL HAITIANS. CAMBRONNE ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE GOH

REPORTED THAT CAMBRONNE WAS A MEMBER OF A COMMISSION ASSIGNED
BY DUVALIER TO INTERROGATE THE PERSONS ARRESTED DURING THE WEEK
OF 1 APRIL 1970.) WHILE CAYARD WAS WITH DUVALIER, CAMBRONNE
TELEPHONED DUVALIER TO SAY THAT CAYARD SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED

COMPLICITY IN ANTI-GOVERNMENT PLOTTING. DUVALIER ASKED CAMBRONNE
TO REPEAT HIS ACCUSATION WHILE HE GAVE CAYARD THE TELEPHONE

DUVALIER REASSURED CAYARD OF HIS TRUST IN HIM AND REQUESTED
CAYARD TO ARREST TWO COAST GUARD OFFICERS DURING THE COURSE OF

THAT HE KNEW THE ADDRESS OF ONLY ONE OF THE TWO OFFICERS.

(HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: ALTHOUGH SOURCE DID NOT INDICATE HOW BLAIN HAD "DOUBLE-CROSSED" CHARLES, CHARLES WAS REPORTED IN OCTOBER 1969 TO BE FINANCING A PLOT BEING HEADED BY COL, OCTAVE CAYARD, COMMANDER OF THE COAST GUARD, SEE TDCS-314/15048-69. ALSO IN OCTOBER 1969, TDCS-314/15083-69 REPORTED ANOTHER PLOT AGAINST THE DUVALIER GOVERNMENT BEING HEADED BY BLAIN. CHARLES, HOWEVER, WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THIS REPORT AS BEING INVOLVED IN BLAIN'S PLOT.)

2. FOURCAND SAID THE INQUIRY IS CONTINUING. HE SAID THAT HE WOULD DEFEND THE PRISONERS AND ADDED THAT NO ONE WOULD BE SHOT AS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: FOURCAND PROBABLY IS REFERRING TO A SIMILAR PURGE OF SUSPECTED PLOTTERS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT CARRIED OUT BY DUVALIER IN MID-1967, WHICH RESULTED IN THE EXECUTION OF 19 ARMY OFFICERS.)

RUMOR CIRCUIT REMARKABLY QUIET AS OF MORNING 9 APRIL.

STATION ASSETS HAVE HAD NOTHING NEW TO REPORT SINCE EVNISER/8'S ACCOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN COAST GUARD. EVEN LAPURE INFORMANTS WHO SOMETIMES WORK OVERTIME CONCOCTING RATIONALES OF PAST EVENTS AND GUESSTIMATES OF FUTURE IN THIS TYPE OF SITUATION HAVE BEEN SILENT.

MEMORANDUM FOR : Deputy Chief, VH/7

REFERENCE : Your request this subject

Following our receipt of information that Clemard-Joseph Charles had taken a list of requirements into the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and asked help in filling them, WH Division sent a memorandum on 19 August 1969 to the Chief, DCS, asking that DCS's contact with Louis A. Brun (from whom Charles had received the requirements) be terminated.

The DCS New York office on 29 August 1969 sent a memorandum to Chief, DCS, which reviewed the case, noted Brun had been guilty of sloppy security, and concluded that no further requirements would be given him. This memorandum did not, however, say that contact would be terminated; in fact, it said they would continue to de-brief Brun whenever he returned from a trip to Haiti. This memorandum was sent to Port-au-Prince (HTPW-1347, 17 Sept 1969).

The Station replied (Port-au-Prince 6496, 11 Oct 69) that this was not enough, that the contact should be completely severed. WH/Branch 7 officers then met with Mr. George Musulin of DCS to discuss the matter further, WH/7 officers maintaining that there was more political action hazard to this contact than the FI product justified. Musulin agreed to raise the matter with C/DCS. The result was a menorandum on 16 October 1969 from C/DCS to C/WHD which referred to the original WHD memorandum of 19 August and advised that contact with Brun has been terminated. Port-au-Prince was so informed (DIR 48277, 21 Oct 69).

ACQ (23 OCTOBER 1969) FIELD NO.

SOURCE A YOUNG HAITIAN EXILE LEADER WHO IS WELL EDUCATED AND WHO HAS A
WIDE VARIETY OF CONTACTS IN HAITIAN EXILE GROUPS IN EUROPE AND
THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. HIS REPORTING HAS BEEN RELIABLE. HE
OBTAINED THE INFORMATION FROM ONE OF HIS CONTACTS INSIDE HAITI
WHO HAS BECOME INVOLVED IN THE PLOTTING. SOURCE WAS AWARE THAT
THE INFORMATION WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OFFICIALS OF THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.

1. ALTHOUGH NO SPECIFIC DATE HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR THE ACTION,
   COL. OCTAVE CAYARD, COMMANDER OF THE COAST GUARD, GEN.
   GERARD CONSTANT, CHIEF OF STAFF OF THE ARMED FORCES, AND
   COL. GRACIA JACQUES, COMMANDER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL GUARD,
   ARE LAYING PLANS TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT FRANCOIS

DUVALIER AND TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES AS A JUNTA. THE
PLOT IS BEING HEADED BY CAYARD AND IS BEING FINANCED BY CLEMARD
JOSEPH CHARLES, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMERCIAL BANK OF HAITI,
IN THE AMOUNT OF $600,000.

2. IN THE ORIGINAL PLAN, THE PRESIDENTIAL GUARD WAS REGARDED
   AS A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PLAN AND, THEREFORE,
   CAYARD AND CONSTANT AGREED TO INCLUDE JACQUES IN THE JUNTA ON THE
   GROUNDS THAT IT WAS A NECESSARY EVIL. CAYARD'S ONLY CONTACT WITH
   JACQUES, HOWEVER, HAS BEEN INDIRECTLY THROUGH CAPTAIN THOMAS
   (FNU). (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THOMAS PROBABLY IS IDENTICAL WITH
   MAJOR JEAN THOMAS, EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE PRESIDENTIAL
   GUARD.)

3. BESIDES THE ASSISTANCE THE PLOTTERS HAVE OBTAINED FROM
   INSIDE HAITI, THEY ALSO ARE SEEKING SUPPORT FROM HAITIAN EXILES
   WHO ACTIVELY OPPOSE THE DUVALIER REGIME.

4. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: IN MID-MAY 1969, A MILITARY JUNTA
   WHICH INCLUDED CAYARD AND CONSTANT, WAS BEING FORMED TO OVERTHROW
   THE HAITIAN GOVERNMENT. AT THAT TIME, IT WAS NOT CLEAR IF THE
   GROUP HAD ACTUALLY APPROACHED JACQUES, BUT IT WAS THOUGHT THAT

was originally introduced to WODISH in New York City by Subject on 15 April 1966. Until the early fall of 1967, much of WODISH activity with IDEN A was devoted to arranging contacts with various elements of LNHARP, which IDEN A requested on behalf of Subject, and reporting operational information. To the best of WODISH knowledge and belief, however, none of these contacts produced any tangible assistance to Subject's various schemes. With two exceptions, WODISH relationship with IDEN A since October 1967 has been exclusively that of foreign intelligence collection. The exceptions were Subject's request for a secret meeting with a WOLADY envoy in May 1969, and an independent similar request from another group in the same month. As has been fully reported, IDEN A made it perfectly clear to WODISH and to Subject and to the other group that he was acting only as a channel and that he was not actively involved or interested. We (WODISH) simply transmitted the request. We wish to point out that what the Desk calls IDEN's "Lobbying" for Subject ended before October 1967. During the nearly two years in which the contact in the WODISH New York Office has dealt with IDEN A, the latter has never sponsored or "lobbied" for Subject's various schemes. IDEN A has occasionally relayed information concerning them, but has told WODISH repeatedly that he no longer wishes to be involved politically with Subject.

"c. We wish also to point out that IDEN A, as a regular supplier of foreign intelligence on Haiti, has supplied data which originate with Haitians other than Subject, and, therefore, IDEN A is not merely Subject's mouthpiece. Specifically, IDEN B and IDEN C are two of IDEN A's Haitian sources. IDEN B is a well-known Haitian businessman; IDEN C is a former deputy."

"d. We (WODISH) are not concerned with Subject, but are very much so with IDEN A. We do not believe that IDEN A is involved in any current revolutionary scheme in Haiti. We are, however, disturbed at the unprofessional way in which IDEN A handled the questions concerning foreign companies in Haiti. We did not request IDEN A to consult Subject about the requirements on foreign companies and, in view of the manner in which IDEN A handled our requirements, we shall continue only to accept information which he proffers on his return from his frequent trips to Haiti, and shall refrain from briefing him. We have requested our WOROMP customers to give us an evaluation of IDEN A's intelligence reporting. Unless this evaluation is unfavorable, we shall continue to exploit IDEN A in the manner just described. Insofar as contact between IDEN A and Subject is concerned, (1) we cannot prevent IDEN A from talking to Subject (or anybody else), but (2) we have never in the past and shall not in the future request that IDEN A contact Subject on behalf of WODISH."

3. To date, the WOROMP evaluation of IDEN A's reporting has not been received. However, since WODISH has agreed to refrain from briefing IDEN A prior to any future trips he may make to Haiti, there should be no recurrence of the type of situation described in Ref C.

SUBJECT: DCS Relationship with Louis A.Brun

Ref: WH/7 Memoranda, 28 May 69, and 19 Aug 69, same subject

1. We have carefully considered WH/7's comments about Louis A. Brun and his relationship with Clemard Joseph Charles. We have concluded that in the matter of the nine questions concerning the activity of foreign companies in Haiti Eran has been guilty at least of sloppy security procedures and have decided to modify our relationship with him.

2. Charles has never doubted that Brun represented a channel to US government authority which he could use to supplement his contacts with members of the US Embassy staff in Port-au-Prince. Brun vas originally introduced to DCS in New York City by Charles on 15 Apr 1966 (see memorandum FY-251-66). Until the early fall of 1967, mich of our activity with Brun was devoted to arranging contacts with verious elements of the US goverment, which Brun requested on becalf of Charles, and reporting operational information. To the best co our knowledge and belief, however, none of these contacts produced any tangible assistance to Charies's various schemes. With two exceptions, our relationship with Brun since October 1967 has been exclusively that of foreign intelligence coliection. The exceptions were Charles's request for a secret meeting with a US envoy in by 1969 and an 15-dependent sinilar request from acother group in the same month. As has been fully reported, Brun nade it perfectly clear to us and to Charies and to the other group that he was acting only as a channel and that he was not actively involved or interested. We simply trans-mitted the requests. We wish to point out that what WH/7 calis Brun's "Lobbying" for Charles ended before October 1967. During the rearly two years in which Mitchell has dealt with Brun, the latter has never sponsored or "Lobbied" for Charies's various schemes. He has occasionally relayed information concerning them, but has told us repeatedly that he no longer vishes to be involved politically with Charles.

1.  Opponents of Haitian President Francois Duvalier have formed a new political opposition group. The following are members: Colonel Cayard (Commandant of the Haitian Coast Guard); Captain Daniel (assistant to Cayard); G√©rard Constant (Haitian Army Chief of Staff); Colonel Kesner Elain (in charge of Haitian Army quarter-master depots); and Colonel Gracia Jaermes (Commandant of the Presidential Palace Guard). [ See 00-3-321/05913-69 (paragraph 2-e) and 00-B-321/14515-69 (paragraph 3) for earlier data concerning some of the members of this group. ]

2.  This group is now working with Clemard Joseph Charles and has formulated, largely under the direction of the latter, a tentative political plan for the organization of a post-Duvalier Haiti. The group is anxious to act, because some of the members, notably Daniel and Cayard, fear that they will be arrested in the not-too-distant future. The entire membership displays, however, the trait common to all Haitian opposition groups: they will not act until President Duvalier dies, becomes totally incapacitated or is overthrown by somebody else. Jacques is an important addition to the group. He is completely loyal to President Duvalier, but has no use for the other members of the Duvalier family. Consequently, he will play no active part unless the President in some manner disappears from the scene.

3.  This group still wishes to exercise power during a transitional period following President Duvalier's departure (see 00-B-321/14515-69 (paragraph 3)). Charles does not want to hold any political appointment during this transition period, but plans to recover his position as the head of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and travel abroad, to raise money for foreign economic assistance to Haiti. He plans to establish a political party, to be known as TOP (Travail,

Ordre, Progres). Charles hopes that TOP will become one of two or three political parties in the post-Duvalier period and is convinced that TOP will win a constitutional victory at the polls and propel hin to power. In the meantime, Colonel Kesner Blain will be the head of the provisional government. Blain has no long-range political ambitions. Charles and his colleagues plan a new constitution for Haiti, which will provide for a President and for a Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will exercise the effective power. Charles expects : that TOP's electoral victory will make him, as TOP's leader, Prime Minister in the new constitutional government.

Reportedly, Charles recently received from the US (no additional data available) the sum of US$230 thousand. This money is to be used to finance the overthrow of President Duvalier. I cannot confirm the accuracy of this reported gift.

15 AUG 1969

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Domestic Contact Service

SUBJECT: DCS Case 47540 - Contact with
Louis A. Brun/Clemard Joseph Charles

1. On 29 July 1969, Station Port au Prince advised that Clemard Joseph Charles had passed a list of nine questions concerning the Haitian economy to an official of the United States Embassy in Port au Prince. The list of questions was written in English in standard U.S. Government format and, although sterile, appeared to be intelligence requirements. Charles told the Embassy official that he had just finished a "big job" for the Pentagon and implied that the list also came from the Pentagon. The Embassy official suspected that Charles had passed a copy of the list to the National Palace.

2. On 2 August, a representative of the WH/Haiti Desk contacted Mr. George Husulin, Operational Support Staff of DCS, and learned that the DCS office in New York had briefed Mr. Louis A. Brun and had orally passed a List of CIRI. requirements to Brun concerning Haiti prior to his trip to Haiti during the week of 21 July. Mr. Musulin speculated that Brun had probably noted the DCS requirements on paper and then had passed a copy to Charles upon his arrival in Haiti.

3. For a number of years, the United States Government has been aware of the political ambitions of Charles and his alleged plotting to overthrow the Duvalier regime. In 1967, this rather open plotting led to his imprisonment for over one year. Also, since May 1963, Charles has been trying to obtain support from the United States Government for his plots but he has been consistently rebuffed. Charles is not held in high esteem by U.S. officials and his motives are highly questionable. He owes his position in Haiti to his relationship with Duvalier and his ability to successfully manage some of

the more notorious financial rackets of the regime. Charles enjoys no political foliowing and even the "plots" with which he is associated are viewed with considerable reserve. For example, we have never been able to confirm that Charles was involved with the "military junta" formed in May 1969, as he claimed. In February 1959, the U.S. Embassy in Port au Prince commented that, with regard to the most recent plotting of Charles, "the possibility cannot be excluded that Charles....could be a provocation to determine the real motives of the United States Government towards the Duvalier regime." We concur in the Embassy's views.

4. During the past three years, the WH Division has been kept advised of the contact between DCS and Brun and his relationship with Charles. We are also aware from DCS and other sources of the efforts by Brun to obtain support from the United States Government for Charles. Brun is, of course, a close collaborator of Charles and a business representative of his in New York City. Brun has contacted officials of the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and even a person with access to President Johnson on Charles' behalf. The Chief of Caribbean Affairs of the Department of State categorically told Brun in June 1967 that the United States Government was not interested in supporting the plots of Charles or anyone else against Duvalier, but this advice seems to have fallen on deaf ears. The most recent example of Brun's lobbying was in May 1969 when Brun passed on to DCS a request from Charles for a secret meeting between a U.S. envoy and a representative of the "military junta." Brun's involvement with Charles requires that he be considered a biased source of information. While some of the information Brun has obtained from Charles has been of interest, there is hardly anything that was not available through other channels and indeed, much of it was slanted.

5. As was set forth in WH/7 memoranda to the Operational Support Staff, DCS, on 16 July 1968 and 28 May 1969, we interpose no objection to DCS maintaining contact with Brun for its own purposes. However, the

relationship between Brun and Charles has now taken on operational characteristics (agent/sub-agent) with Brun levying requirements on Charles in Haiti to service on behalf of DCS. The relationship between Brun and Charles also has manifested political and security aspects which could adversely affect the interests of the United States Government regarding Haiti. Accordingly, we request that the contact between Brun and Charles on behalf of DCS be terminated.

Subject of 201-357029

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES
REFERENCES: A. DIRECTOR 26288 dated 1 August 1969

B. HTPA-2443 dated 29 July 1969

ACTION REQUIRED: See Paragraph 5.

1. The Station would like to offer its views on the WODISH contact, through Identity of Paragraph 1 Reference A (hereinafter IDEN), with 201-357029, as well as on the question of the requirements which 201-357029 gave LNPURE and which were forwarded to Headquarters in Reference B.

2. Since IDEN has been told that his contact is with LNSHOE and since he has told 201-357029 that fact, and since 201-357029 has apparently, in his mind at least, converted that fact into contact with RVROCK, and has probably spread both stories with his associates and thereby throughout the local milieu, we have, in effect, a dangerous security situation. When we consider that the LNPURE receives all the information that 201-357029 gives IDEN anyway, and most of the time receives the information directly from 201-357029, then we have an operation that is difficult to justify.

3. In the case of the requirements forwarded with Reference B, we have a situation in which WODISH levied requirements on 201-357029, through IDEN. 201-357029 then turned those requirements over to LNPURE which returned then via 201-357029 and IDEN to WODISH. Why not cut out the middleman and the security complications, and save the headaches?

4. The Station feels that the WODISH handling of 201-357029 results in a case that has the potential of causing severe problems for AKULE, and that it could well be that AKULE will be made to bear the blame since elements within RVROCK might feel that the ultimate responsibility for supervision of the case lies with AKULE.

# MEMORANDUM FOR : Chief, Domestic Contact Service

# SUBJECT : DCS Case 47540 - Contact with Louis A. Brun/Clenard Joseph Charles

1. On 29 July 1969, Station Port au Prince advised that Cleward Joseph Charles had passed a list of nine questions concerning the Haitian economy to an official of the United States Embassy in Port qu Prince. The list of questions was written in English in standard 5.8. Government format and, although sterile, appeared to be intelligence requirements. Charles toid the Entassy official that he had just finished a "big jot" for the Pentagon and implied that the list also came from the Pentagon The Embassy official suspected that Charles had passed a copy of the list to the National Palace.

2. On 2 August, a representative of the WH/Haiti Desk contacted Mr. George Husulin, Operational Support Staff of DC, and learned that the DCS office in New York bad briefed Mr. Louis A. Brun and had orally passed a list of CIRL requirements to Erun concerning Haiti prior to his trip to Haiti during the week of 21 July. Mr. Husulin speculated that Brun had probably noted the DCS requirements on paper and then had passed a copy to Charles upon his arrival in Haiti.

3. For a mucher of years, the United States Government has been aware of the political ambitions of Charles and In his alleged plotting to oerthrow the Duvalier regine 1967, this rather open plotting led to his imprisonment for over one year. Also, since May 1963, Charles has been trying to obtain support from the United States Government for his plots but he has been consistently rebuffed Charles is not held in high esteen by U.8. officials and his motives are highly questionablo He oves his position in Haiti to his relationship with Duvalier and his ability to successfully manage some of the more notorious financial rackets of the regine Charles enjoys no political following and even the "plots" with which he is associated are viewed with con- siderable reserve For example, we have never been able to confirm that Charles was involved with the "military junta" formed in May 1969, as he claimed. In February 1969, the

US manufacturers are setting up subsidiary companies in Haiti or are forming partnerships with Haitian enterprises to produce such items as underwear, baseballs, footwear and other export items. They use Haitian facilities and materials imported from the US.

1. What specific companies are involved in producing these goods, and are they completely owned by Haitians (HT) or are they in partnership with US companies?

2. Are there prospects that other companies are entering the field (using Haitian enterprises to produce goods from imported US materials)?

3. Will these enterprises expand? How important would it be to Haiti if these enterprises expanded? discontinued production?

4. What articles are produced?

5. What materials are imported to produce the final product? What percentage of the imported materials are part of the finished product?

6. Give the figures on the value of the imported goods vs. the value of the export goods to gain Haitian profit figures.

7. How do the domestic producers and the US importers feel about operating under President Duvalier? Are there any difficulties? Have investment conditions in Haiti changed since these enterprises began operating?

8. Does the Haitian workers' lack of education affect their training?

9. How effective is the Haitian social security system? Do US importers contribute to the social security fund?

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Domestic Contact Service
Operational Support Staff

ATTENTION: Mr. George S. Masulin

SUBJECT: DCS Case 47540 - Request by Haitian
Opposition Group for Secret Interview
with U.S. Official

1. This memorandum will serve to confirm the telephone conversations between your office and the Chief of the Balti Desk on 15 and 27 May 1969 concerning the request made through Kr. Louis A. Bran on the above subject. During these conversations, your office was advised that the WH Division has no interest in contacting any representative or sente of the plotting group.

2. The WE Division considers Cleward Joseph Charles to be a perennial anti-Duvalier plotter in Port su Prince with little means or following to carry out his anti-government designs. During the weer of 11 May 1969, Charles approached the Embassy in Port as Prince with basically she gase information as relayed to the DCS office in New York by Mr. Bran. The only difference was that be did not request that a U.S. Government official make contact with the internal , ter the the Fabeesy prowide thot the U.S. Covernment would look benevolently on the group once the coup vas launched. The Bebassy replied that the U.S. Government had a fira policy not to intervene in such matters and that no such assurance could be expected.

3. Since 1967, Charles has made similar overtures to the U.S. Government for support of his anti-government plans. When revieving these approaches, there has always been sose doubt as to the accuracy of the information that Charles (or Brun) has furnished. While it was accepted that Charles vas actually plotting against Duvalier, it could never be determined if he was actually a member of the plotting group, which usually included sembers of the Haitian Army, or if Charles had sleply become aware of an anti-Duvalier plot and vas trying to act as a troker between the plotters and the

U.S. Government for his own interests.

4. At the present time, fairly reliable reports have been received that certain officials of the Haitian Army are trying to form a junta to take power in the event Duvalier dies. Some members of this junta are reportedly anxious to overthrow Duvalier, should he recover, but so far have not established a timetable or decided how they intend to carry out the coup. Also, the illness of Duvalier has undoubtedly inspired anti-Duvalier plotting by other groups in Haiti but no reliable information is available on their plans. It is interesting to note that Clezard Joseph Charles is not identified as a plotter in any of the reports from internal sources.

5. As was mentioned in the WH/7 memorandum dated 16 July 1968, we do not interpose any objection to DCS maintaining contact with Brun for its own purposes. However, we feel that in the interests of security and also in conformance with U.S. policy, that Brun should clearly understand that we have no interest in establishing contact with any member of the internal group through his channel and further that the U.S. Government has no interest in becoming involved in any anti-Duvalier activities.

DATE OF INFO: 5-10 MAY 1969

SUBJECT: REQUEST BY HAITIAN OPPOSITION GROUP FOR SECRET INTERVIEW
--WITH US OFFICIAL

1. ONE OF THE UNDERGROUND OPPOSITION GROUPS IN HAITI IS CENTERED IN THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS: LAVENS OPT LAVENS (FORMER DEPUTY, NOW IN SEMI-HIDING); COLONEL VESTVER BLAIN OPT BLAIN. (HEAD OF ARMY QUARTERMASTER WAREHOUSES): COLONEL CAYASO OPT CAYARD (HEAD OF THE COAST GUARD): FOU CONSTANT OPT CONSTANT (C IEF OF STAFF).
   THEY WISH TO ORGANIZE A JUNTA, FOLLOWING THE DEATH OR RETIREMENT OF HAITIAN PRESIDENT DUVALIER, AND EXERCISE POWER DURING A TRANSITION PERIOD. FOLLOWING THE TRANSITION PERIOD, THIS GROUP WISHES TO HAVE FREE ELECTIONS AND THEN RETIRE FROM POLITICAL ACTIVITY. LAVENS WOULD LIKE TO BECOME A MINISTER. BLAIN WOULD LIKE A DIPLOMATIC APPOINTMENT, CAYARD WOULD LIKE TO RETIRE TO HIS CATTLE RANCH. THE GROUP HAS NO PARTICULAR CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT.

2. THIS GROUP ALLEGES THAT IT COMMANDS WIDE SUPPORT AMONG ARMY PERSONNEL IN PORT-AU-PRINCE AND IN THE HAITIAN HINTERLAND.
   THE GROUP IS REPORTEDLY WILLING TO WORK WITH ANY OTHER OPPOSITION GROUP, EXCEPT THE COMMUNISTS BUT IT DOES NOT WANT TO APPEAR PUBLICLY BEHOLDEN TO THE US OR TO ANY OTHER NON-HAITIAN POWER.

3. UNTIL RECENTLY, THE PLAN OF THIS GROUP WAS TO SIT BACK, WAIT FOR INTERNAL UPHEAVALS AND THEN MOVE IN TO ASSUME POWER. THEY DID NOT WANT TO ACT ON THEIR OWN, BUT PREFERRED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 100

AN INTERNAL UPHEAVAL CREATED BY SOMEBODY ELSE.

4. THE MOST RECENT RUMORS CONCERNING PRESIDENT DIVALIER'S HEALTH
   HAVE, HOWEVER, CAUSED THE GROUP TO CHANGE ITS MIND. THE MEMBERS NOW
   DECLARE THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND THAT AS SOON AS PRESIDENT
   DIVALIER "GOES ON THE OPERATING TABLE" THEY WILL MOVE.

5. THE GROUP RECOGNIZES, HOWEVER, THAT CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTIES
   LIE IN ITS PATH AND IS MOST ANXIOUS TO DISCUSS THE ENTIRE MATTER IN
   SECRET WITH A US ENVOY. WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY TO THIS ENVOY IS NOT
   KNOWN.

6. THE GROUP HAS ORGANIZED THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE FOR THE ENVOY
   TO FOLLOW. FIRST, WE MUST SEND A CABLE TO THE FOLLOWING CABLE
   ADDRESS: STSLAVAS, PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI. THE CABLE MUST READ AS
   FOLLOWS: "ARRIVING ON (LIST DATE) TO DISCUSS THE SISAL DEAL. PLEASE
   RESERVE A ROOM" FOR ME AT THE SANS SOUCI HOTEL." THE NAME SIGNED TO
   THE CABLE DOES NOT MATTER. THE CABLE ADDRESS IS THAT OF ESTABLISHMENTS
   LAHEWS-PLAIN & CO., PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI. SECOND, HE MUST REGISTER
   AT THE SANS SOUCI AND AWAIT A CALL OR VISIT FROM A MAN NAMED EDGARD BONI
   RPT BONI. BONI IS KESTNER PLAIN'S BROTHER. THE ORIGINAL FAMILY NAME
   IS "BONI": PLAIN CHANGED HIS NAME. BONI WILL EITHER TAKE THE ENVOY TO
   TALK TO CONSTANT OR WILL INFORM HIM OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE FOR THE
   INTERVIEW. THE ONLY PERSONS PRESENT AT THE INTERVIEW WILL BE CONSTANT
   AND THE ENVOY. THIRD, WHEN THE ENVOY MEETS CONSTANT HE MUST ESTABLISH
   HIS BONA FIDES PPT BONA FIDES BY SAYING: "I HAVE BEEN SENT
   BY MR. EISENHOWER TO DISCUSS SISAL". THE KEY WORD IS "EISENHOWER".

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen of Haitian birth, who makes frequent trips to Haiti. Source maintains close contact with Haitians in the US and with prominent business and political figures in Haiti.

1.  As part of his effort to obtain foreign exchange, Haiti's President Duvalier has decided to award a gambling concession. A US syndicate, consisting of a New York City firm, Keynote Associates, and of Count Michel Levitch, Bishop of the American Orthodox Church, has been trying to obtain the concession. (Collector's Note: see reference for additional details.)

2.  The Bishop has severed his connections with Zeynote, which bombarded President Duvalier with telegrams and made an unannounced trip to Haiti to obtain the concession.

3.  [However, Zeynote received a telegram from Antonic Andre, Director of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti. This message informed them that they would not receive the concession. President Duvalier relies very heavily upon Andre for advice and guidance in economic matters.

4.  Almost at the same time that Keynote received Andre's telegram, Clenard Joseph-Charles notified the Bishop that he would receive the concession on the following terms:

a. A new group of associates of the Bishop will receive 80 percent of the gross receipts from the concession.

b. The Government of Haiti will receive 10 percent of the gross receipts.

c. The Bishop and his chief partner will receive five percent of the gross receipts.

d. The remaining five percent of the gross receipts will be used by the Bishop, reportedly under Haitian supervision, to begin construction of schools and child care centers in Haiti. These schools and centers will be under the auspices of the American Orthodox Church.

5. Joseph-Charles's authorship of the telegram which virtually promised the concession to the new group indicates that his fortunes may be on the mend. He certainly could never have sent such a message without the approval of President Duvalier. That he was permitted to send it indicates that the President may be beginning to look upon him more favorably than he has done in the recent past.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE Naturalized US citizen of Haitian birth, who makes frequent trips to Haiti. Source maintains close contact with Haitians in the US and with prominent business and political figures in Haiti.

1. During recent weeks, the fortunes of Clemard Joseph-Charles seem to have improved. He has been playing a not unimportant role in the award of the Haitian gambling concession (Collector's Note: see reference.), an activity which is designed to bring to Haiti some badly-needed foreign exchange. Although I do not believe that he sees President Duvalier as frequently as he used to prior to his incarceration, he does seem to have recovered some of the confidence which the President used to repose in him.

2. One reason for President Duvalier's dislike of Charles (and one possible reason why the President eventually threw him in jail) is that Charles was instrumental in bringing about the marriage of the President's daughter, Marie-Denise Duvalier, to Colonel Max Dominique. Charles and Marie-Denise have been close friends for many years. Marie-Denise became pregnant by Dominique and went to Charles for help. Charles then intervened with President Duvalier, who was furious, and persuaded him to agree to the marriage. The President was bitterly angry at Dominique and somewhat unjustly blamed Charles for the marriage. He agreed to the necessity for the wedding, but resented his new son-in-law and, by association, so to speak, resented Charles. The President and Dominique have formally reconciled. The President met Colonel Dominique at the airport, when the latter returned to Haiti, and made a point of inviting his son-in-law to ride in the presidential limousine from the airport to the palace. The purpose was to demonstrate the burial of old grudges. It remains to be seen, however, whether or not the reconciliation was genuine and whether or not the President has really forgiven his son-in-law.

3.  Luc-Albert Foucard, Haitian Minister of Tourism, is now in political, if not personal, eclipse. He no longer goes to his office. The New York City manager of the Haitian Tourist Bureau, Jean Sorel, is in Haiti and is acting in Foucard's stead. Ramah Theodore, Deputy Director of Tourism, is amiable and is a friend of President Duvalier. He is, however, of little stature and is not capable of doing anything more than the routine daily chores of the office. Foucard cannot afford to call attention to himself, because he is fearful for the physical safety of his sister, Madame Saint-Victor. President Duvalier recently dismissed her as his personal secretary and replaced her with his daughter, wife of Colonel Max Dominique. Since then, rumors have abounded that Madame Saint-Victor may be marked for physical liquidation [Collector's Note: see reference.]. Whether or not these rumors have any foundation in fact, there is no doubt that the members of the Foucard family (i e, Luc-Albert, Madame Saint-Victor and their sister, Madame Bella Foucard Poitvien) have all made themselves as inconspicuous as possible. The President's change in secretaries has led to a diminution of the power and influence of the Foucard clan.

Port-au-Prince, le 8 Novembre 1968

Excellence,
Vous n'ignorez pas l'int√©r√™t avec le quel j'ai suivi les √©tapes de la campagne √©lectorale qui devait aboutir au Triomphe de votre Candidat R√©publicain aux √©lections pr√©sidentielles Am√©ricaines.

Vous le savez, √† n'en pas douter, que j'ai souhait√© de tout coeur Votre propre Triomphe. Je le croyais irr√©sistible.

Vous avez fait de votre mieux, mais Vous avez perdu.

Que pouviez-Vous faire? Les causes contiennent qu'il y a quelque chose qu'on ne peut √©carter par des votes ou des votes - une ceinture qui enserre le monde.

> "Tout ce qui a √©t√© d√©cid√© arrivera.
> La volont√© infinie et sup√©rieure de
> Dieu ne peut pas √™tre transgress√©e."

Certes, pour atteindre l'objet de vos aspirations, Vous Vous √™tes heurt√©s √† des bornes insurmontables. Vous Vous √™tes cramponn√©s √† l'espoir de bousculer les faits et les hommes.

Apr√®s maintes exp√©riences Vous convenez que depuis le d√©part la victoire constituait pratiquement une gageure, et qu'il fallait commencer plus t√¥t; c'est, dire que le monde est r√©gi par des lois.

Maintenant que le rideau est tir√©, je prends plaisir √† formuler des voeux pour que soit maintenu intact le courage magnifique dont Vous vous √™tes fait preuve tout au long de Votre campagne √©lectorale.

Je sais, pour r√©p√©ter le Pr√©sident JOHNSON, que "Vous continuerez √† servir l'Am√©rique aussi longtemps que Vous vivrez".

Port-au-Prince, le 8 Novembre 1963

Monsieur le President Elu,

J'ai suivi, comme tous les lettres d'ailleurs, les elections presidentielles Americaines qui constituent toujours un evenement international de premiere importance.

En effet, le monde entier a enregistr√© les differentes phases de la campagne electorale qui devait aboutir a votre av√®nement a la Pr√©sidence des Etats-Unis d'Am√©rique.

Un vent de renouveau souffle sur l'Am√©rique consciente de sa force et de son rayonnement dans le monde.

Vous jouissez, Monsieur le President Elu, d'un prestige incontest√©.

Je suis donc certain que, sous Votre Administration, les √âtats-Unis d'Am√©rique, avec le prestige que lui donnent son pass√© incomparable et ses grandes ressources tant humaines qu'√©conomiques, sauront remplir sa vocation de Leadership du monde libre et sa place de premier plan parmi les autres Nations du globe qui conspirent ardemment apr√®s un monde pacifique et plus humain.

C'est le souhait que je forme √† l'occasion de votre triomphe aux √©lections pr√©sidentielles Am√©ricaines.

Je vous prie de recevoir, Monsieur le Pr√©sident Elu, mes voeux sinc√®res pour Votre bonheur personnel et la prosp√©rit√© du peuple Am√©ricain.

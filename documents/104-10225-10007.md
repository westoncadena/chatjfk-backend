Dear Earl:

You have just completed, at my direction, seven weeks of full-time service on the GS-13 Clandestine Service Personnel Evaluation Board, I know that this work has been particularly demanding. Your participation and diligent application of your professional experience have been decisive factors in the successful accomplishment of the Board's missions.

In the course of this assignment you have become thoroughly familiar with the use and interpretation of personnel files and personnel practices of the Clandestine Service. Having reviewed and analyzed the files of one hundred or more CS officers, you have had to make judgments and recommendations concerning their relative-ranking and their qualifications for promotion, for training required to overcome a deficiency or enhance career effectiveness, for changes of assignment to further career development and for Quality Step Increases to recognize outstanding performance. In so doing, you have carefully studied the career development of a large number of officers in all components of the CS, both as individuals and in relationship to each other in terms of morit and value to the Clandestine Service.

You have become familiar with a broad spectrum of personnel and administrative problems on a practical working level and have acquired a knowledge of personnel management which will better equip you to handle supervisory positions which require personnel reporting and career development of subordinates. The committee format of the panels has also deepened your understanding of the conference approach to management problems.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Earl J. WWilliamson

SUBJECT : Foreign Divorce Decree

1.  The purpose of this memorandum is to bring certain information to your attention which relates to the fact that your current spouse was a party to the dissolution in Mexico of a former marriage.

2.  Recently, the Office of General Counsel completed a study of the validity of a Mexican divorce decree and potential problems arising from such a divorce for JKLANCE employees concerned and JKLANCE. A summary of OGC's study la attached.

3.  You will note from the attachment that the employee whose current marriage follows a Mexican divorce may be confronted with serious problems affecting eligibility for payment of various government benefits such as reimbursement of hospitalization expenses, survivorship benefits and certain types of overseas allowances. My purpose in writing to you, therefore, is to be sure you are made aware of and understand the seriousness of the problems which would arise in the event of a challenge to the validity of the Mexican divorce and, consequently, to the validity of the current marriage. This challenge could arise at any time and from s number of sources.

4.  JKLANCE has another interest stemming from Mexican divorces and this is one of security, depending upon the employee's specific employment. In the ovent such a divorce is challenged, subsequent litigation and attendant publicity become quite probable. It is, of course, in JKLANCE's best interest that this sort of activity be avoided where possible.

5.  Recognising that there are various types of Mexican divorce, and also that the various states in the United States have decided cases in different ways depending on the type of Mexican divorce involved and its own case law.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

you may wish to discuss your personal situation with your attorney or a representative of JKLANCE's Office of General Counsel. In the meantime, however, JALANCE'e position with respect to your situation is that it assumes the validity of your current marriage, unless the earlier Mexican divorce action and your current marriage are challenged. 'hould that challenge over occur, it may be necessary for JKLANCE to determine that your eligibility for benefits based on your current marriage must be suspended until such time as the challenge is litigated or otherwise resolved. Special note should be taken of the fact that such a challenge might arise after your death, possibly resulting in the distribution of insurance procoods and other death benefits to other than your immediate family as constituted at your death and contrary to your own intentions and wishes.

6. Please advise me of your plans and any actions taken in connection with the above. If you have any questions on the substance of this memorandum or its purpose, please do not hesitate to let me know.

SUBJECT : Mr. Earl J. Williamson - Request for Approval of Ten Days of Additional Home Leave

REFERENCE : HR 20-306(3) (b) (10)

1. The circumstances surrounding Mr. Earl-J. Williamson's departure from San Jose, where he had been Chief of Station, are described in the attached memorandum. Because of the disruptive nature of his PCS transfer to Washington, Mr. Williamson has requested an additional ten days of home leave. As he is a State Department integree, the Office of Finance, subject to approval of his request, can offset the State disallowance of his additional home leave and the charge to his annual leave by adjusting Mr. Williamson's escrow leave account as appropriate.

2. Due to the nature of his transfer, Mr. Williamson's request for an additional ten days of home leave appears to be warranted. In accordance with the provisions of the referenced regulation, it is recommended that Mr. Williamson's request for an additional ten days of home leave be approved.

g. On 11 February 1971 1 received Department orders based on my previously requested itinerary for home leave and reassignment to Washington,

h. My home leave itinerary included five days annual leave in Mexico onroute and 25 days home leave reporting for duty on 5 April. I actually arrived in D. C. on 23 March and was fully occupied until 5 April in locating and renting a homo and getting my family mottlod.

1. In accordance with Department regulations, I have boon credited with only 15 days home leave and the additional 10 days have been charged to annual leave.

2. I submit that the circumstances of my departure from San Jose woro unusual and beyond my responsibility or control. The delay in departure definitely occurred because of opera- tional requiroments abroad which negated my original home leave schedulo. I would like to request the granting of an exception to the 15 day homo leave limitation to show my return to duty as of 23 March (the date I arrived in D. C.) rather than 5 April the date the Department has me returning to duty.

Mr. Arthur Jacobe,
U.S. Embassy.

Our Dean Anthon,

Now that Earl Williamson has come and gone
I would like to record how very grateful I am to yourself
and your Government for arranging his visit to Jamaica.

2. As far as our Intelligence Committee is
   concerned, his visit was an unqualified success at all of
   the various levels at which he spoke, and I hope that he
   felt the same way about it.

3. For my part, I believe that it was particularly
   valuable because it made my Government aware at the highest
   level of the mutual benefit to be derived from the closest
   co-operation between our two Organizations.

4. I would be very grateful if you would pass on
   to the appropriate quarter our highest appreciation of
   Mr. Williamson's work during his two days in Kingston.

Yours Vain Reind,

MSLUGGAGE - Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization Retirement and Disability System

Action: Advise Subject

REF: Book Dispatch 5096

1. Subject has been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organisation Retirement and Disability system and has been so designated effective 24 October 1965.

2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons, the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this technical requirement may be satisfied, subject should be notified promptly of his designation and of his right to appeal. Any questions he may have should be answered in accordance with information contained in Book Dispatch 5096 or referred to Headquarters. An appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of this dispatch or acceptance of designation will be assumed.

3. We believe that the benefits of the Organisation retirement system are superior to the benefits of the Civil service retirement system. However, there are a few situations in which an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive a higher annuity under the Civil service system. Because of this, the policy decision has been made that a participant in the Organization system who would receive a higher annuity under the Civil service system may, not later than one year prior to his retirement, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil service system. Thus, subject should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding, whether he regards his designation as a participant-adverse to his best interests.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Central Intelligence

THROUGH : Director of Personnel

SUBJECT : Request of Earl J. Williamson, GS-15, to Remain in the Employment of CIA Following Marriage to an Alien

1. This memorandum submits a recommendation for your approval: this recommendation is contained in paragraph 7.

2. Mr. Earl J. Williamson, a GS-15 Operations Officer, has requested permission to remain in the employ of CIA as a Staff Employee following his marriage to Miss Virginia J. Lobo, a 26 year old Cuban citizen living in Spain. The marriage is scheduled to take place in October 1965.

3. Mr. Williamson, 50 years old, attended Loyola University in 1947-43 and Berlitz School of Languages in 1948. Prior to joining CIA, Mr. Williamson served with the U.S. Army (1942-49) achieving the rank of 1st Lieutenant in CIC. Subsequently, he was Chief, Civil Intelligence Branch in the Panama Canal Government (1949-52). Mr. Williamson entered on duty with CIA in June 1952 as a GS-12 Operations Officer with WH Division. In January 1953 he was appointed DCOB, Havana, remaining in this position until January 1959 when he was reassigned to Headquarters. In August 1960 Mr. Williamson was assigned to Madrid and in 1963 was appointed DCOS, Madrid, which is the position he presently occupies.

4. The COS, Madrid, Mr. James A. Noel, has known Miss Lobo for over three years. He says the is a most attractive young lady who is a member of a distinguished and respected Cuban family. She is well educated, fluent (bi-lingual) in English, intelligent, cultured, and gracious. He has found her to be discreet at all times.

5. Chief, WE Division strongly believes on the basis of past performance and proven ability that Mr. Williamson is the kind of officer whom the Agency should retain. Mr. Williamson's record to date shows that he is a mature, experienced, and dedicated officer,

who has spared no effort to expand and improve the Agency's coverage in his area of assignment. WE Division and WH Division, where Mr. Williamson will be reassigned, foresee no difficulty, adverse effect in future usefulness or mobility as a result of this marriage.

6. I have reviewed Mr. Williamson's employment record and consider him an able and valuable member of the Clandestine Services. He has consistently performed his duties well, has strong to outstanding Fitness Reports, and is a definite asset to the Agency. I believe that the proposed marriage will not detract from his long term use by the Clandestine Services.

7. In view of the above consideration, I recommend that Mr. Williamson be continued in Staff Employment Status following his proposed marriage.

He has been assigned to the Madrid Station since October 1960 where he has served as the Deputy Chief of Station and since May 1964 as the Western European Coordinator for Cuban Activities. Since his assignment to the Madrid Station, Mr. Williamson's performance has been outstanding.

In every sense of the word, Mr. Williamson is a dedicated officer who has spared no effort to expand and improve the Agency's coverage in his area of assignment.

3.

SUBJECT: - Application to Marry an Allen

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

application for permission to marry an alien is transmitted to Headquarters with my strong recommendation that it be promptly approved and he be so notified. It has been my privilege to have known flancee for ever three years. She is a most attractive young lady and is a member of a distinguished and respected Cuban family. She is woll-educated, fluent (bi-lingual) in English, intelligent, cultured and gracious. I have found her at all times to be discreet. There is no question whatsoever in my mind that she will be a most loyal American citizen and a credit to her now county and to the Agency in every way. In future assignments abroad she will, without question, be an aid to in the development of contacts and in carrying out their joint representational responsibilities. She is indeed a very fine person. I have no reservations whatsoever - mental or otherwise - with respect to the security aspects of this marriage - as far as I have been able to ascertain, none exist. I do not feel that marriage to this young lady should in any way restrict his future assignments.

I urge speedy and favorable processing of this application.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Clandestine Services Career Service Section A

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion - Mr. Earl J. Williamson

1. Since October 1960, Mr. Williamson has served as Deputy Chief of the Madrid Station, and during an extended period of this time, he was Acting Chief of Station. His performance has been outstanding. Not only has he assisted his Chief in the management of the Station, but simultaneously managed to reinvigorate our liaison program in Spain, which was the particular area of responsibility originally assigned to him. His service has been noteworthy not only for his vigor in initiating new activities but also for his balanced, yet energetic, cutting away of deadwood, useless procedures and purposeless activity.

2. In recent months, in part on his own initiative, and later under forced draft at Headquarters direction, Mr. Williamson has been instrumental in mounting an active operational program targeted against Cuba. Due almost entirely to the imagination, energy, and effort which he has applied, this program has already had considerable success in the acquisition of intelligence and the recruitment of agents, and promises to be even more productive in the future.

3. Mr. Williamson's activity since his assignment to Madrid is clearly of outstanding caliber and it is noteworthy that the present Chief of Station as well as the preceding Chief of Station have both, on the record, rated him as exceptionally able, energetic, and mature. Mr. Williamson has been in his current grade since December 1956. In view of the considered judgment concerning the value of his performance in Spain, his good administrative qualities, his obvious maturity, energy, judgment and experience, it is strongly recommended that Mr. Williamson be promoted to grade GS-15.

1. As reflected in his most recent Fitness Report, Subject, who has been serving as Deputy Chief of Station and Chief of Liaison at this Station, has demonstrated outstanding talents in management of personnel and their activities, developing relationships with liaison in operations both joint and independent. Because of my confidence in him, which is apparently shared by Headquarters, he is being retained here for a long period as Acting Chief of Station after my departure, As I have said in his Fitness Report, he is the best deputy I have had in my *CIA* career and altogether an outstanding officer.

2. Subject has been in grade four and a half years as a GS-14, and because of his outstanding qualifications, I recommend he be inmediately considered for promotion to GS-15.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Chief, Employees Division

FROM: Chief, Foreign Division T

SUBJECT: Carl J. WILLIAMSON

1. It is requested that subject be processed at the grade of GS-11 for Slot No. 7, Intelligence Officer Operations, Lima, Peru, as a replacement for Mr. George P. Stone. Mr. Stone will be transferred to another station in Latin America in the next few months.

2. Although Mr. Williamson is at present a GS-9, he has had a total of approximately 2 years in investigative work with C.I.C., and PDT believes that a rating of CAP-11 is thoroughly justified. Since his present salary in the Canal Zone is $5750 per annus, it is specifically requested that he be processed at the grade of GS-11, $5600 per annua.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Earl J. Williamson
1 April 1970 to 31 March 1971

Mr. Williamson departed San Jose, Costa Rica, on 21 February 1971, after having served as Chief of Station for two and one half years. The last year of his tour was highlighted by two extremely delicate, highly productive operations targeted against the Communist Party of Costa Rica, and a political action opera- tion of a most sensitive nature stemming from them. This latter operation, focused as it was around the president of the country, called for constant good judgment on how to pursue U. S. Govern- ment interests with this highly sensitive and significant intelligence at hand. (It was highlighted at the WH Division's Chiefs of Station Conference held in February 1971 as a classic example of both the collection and use of intelligence on the real "national interest" level.)

Throughout these operations, Mr. Williamson handled him- self very well, especially during the latter part of his tenure when he was under considerable pressure as an almost inevitable conse- quence of the impact of these operations. Ultimately, Mr. Williamson's recall from Costa Rica was requested by the Costa Rican Government. It should be stressed that this was a mark of his operational success rather than the result of any operational "flap" or miscue whatever, (The U. S. Ambassador was the government's ultimate and preferred target but, for a variety of reasons, it was desired by local authority to avoid that kind of a confrontation with the U. S. Government, so Mr. Williamson was selected as the next best target in the Embassy.) Publicity based on false and self-serving leaks by the local government placed Mr. Williamson under the most intense atrain in his final weeks. The


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 121

-2-

fact that, under these general circumstances, he continued to function normally, responding to numerous demands being made on him by the situation and Headquarters, and set about paving the way for his successor to take up the cudgel from the best operational platform all this speaks for itself and certainly underlines the fine quality of Mr. Williamson's professional and personal characteristics.

In the realm of normal activity, Mr. Williamson handled his officers with both firmness and tact. He was a good manager, ran a taut Station, and had cut back on several marginal operations, streamlined others, and initiated some new ones. He writes well and quickly, and he has exceptional fluency in Spanish. He moved very well in the local community and, during his tenure, established a wide range of contacts.

Mr. Williamson's relationship with the Ambassador was excellent, and his wife was a great help to him in discharging his representational duties and in developing contacts within the Costa Rican community.

In sum, Mr. Williamson is a "pro" who turned in a strong performance both before and after the chips were down.

I fully concur with the Rater's comments. I am pleased that Mr. Flannery explained the circumstances surrounding Mr. Williamson's recall from Costa Rica so well. His tour was a fine piece of operational work and in no way should it be tarnished by misinterpretation or gossip.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Earl J. Williamson
1 April 1969 - 31 March 1970

Costa Rica has become progressively more important to the Agency because of its very active Communist Party and signs of the imminent arrival of the Soviets. In anticipation, Mr. Williamson has geared his Station and honed his operations to cope with these problems. San Jose Station has some of the more sophisticated and interesting operations in the Central American area, and the Station is preparing to exploit its assets to the maximum to meet the expected presence of the Soviets.

Mr. Williamson is an old "pro" who has had a variety of experiences in the intelligence field and who brings to his work maturity garnished with enthusiasm and expertise.

He has dono particularly well in guiding his subordinates and extracting the maximum from them. His leadership is deft but firm.

His relationship with the past ambassador, a difficult person to deal with, who was not at first happy to have Mr. Williamson, progressed to the point that he became a valuable member of the Country Team and had the respect of the ambassador. There is a new ambassador now and it is clear that Mr. Williamson has gotten off to a very good start with him.

He has a large range of contacts in the community and he has been helped by a charming wife who is an asset to him in his work.

His subordinates have a high regard for him--from a professional as well as personal standpoint--and took to him for guidance and leadership.

He is judicious in the use of government funds, extract- ing the maximum from the operational dollar. His Spanish is excellent, and his experiences in Latin affairs have given him a grace in moving among the locals.

He is rated as Strong.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: EarlJ. Williamson

1 April 1968 - 31 March 1969

Mr. Williamson began his tour as Chief of Station, San Jose, in July 1968. He was well prepared for the responsibilities of the assignment, having served in two important stations as Deputy Chief of Station, and as Deputy Chief, WH/COG.

At the outset of his assignment, Mr. Williamson was confronted with an ambassador who had reservations on several matters connected with the station, including problems concerning the establishment of a "third country" radio operation. Shortly thereafter Panamanian exile and guerrilla activities placed an additional burden on the San Jose station and on relations with the ambassador. Mr. Williamson weathered these initial rough spots well, keeping Agency interests protected.

In the seven months since his arrival in San Jose, Mr. Williamson not only succeeded in overcoming the ambassador's Initial frostiness, but has mollified the ambassador's misgivings on several potential items of conflict. Furthermore, he has won a strong endorsement from the ambassador who has made it a point to inform Headquarters officers that he is highly pleased by the manner in which Mr. Williamson is handling his assignment.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 130

SUBJECT: Earl J. Williamson
1 April 1968 - 31 March 1969

Mr. Williamson has an aggressive, constructive and realistic approach to operations. He has made a good assessment of the station's operational assets and personnel and has succeeded in sharpening general performances. Coordination and cooperation between the station and Headquarters leaves nothing to be desired.

He displays appropriate cost-consciousness. The morale of station personnel is high. Mr. Williamson and his wife are highly regarded by embassy personnel, and have established a wide circle of Costa Rican friends and contacts.

He has put in a *Strong* performance.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Memorandum in Liou of Fitness Report -
Mr. Earl J. Williamson

1.  Mr. Williamson is on the eve of his departure
    as an overseas Chief of Station. This is a logical and
    Justified next step in his career development. Mr.
    Williamson's responsibilities have been considorable
    in rocent years: DCOS in two important Stations;
    Chiof, FI and then Deputy Chief of WH/COG. It should
    bo pointed out that in the latter position he was
    Acting Chief for long periods, performing admirably.
    His now assignment indicates that the most senior
    officers in the Division have recognized this.

2.  Mr. Williamson is a professional intolligence
    officer in the strictest sense of the word. He is hard-
    driving and tenacious; despite his seniority he is on
    any list of activists; he has the capability of gotting
    things going, of getting the job done. He applies rigid
    standards to his subordinates, but no less rigid thàn
    those ho applies to himself. He is cost-conscious to
    an unusual degree. He is a fluont speaker of idiomatic
    Spanish and can handle himsolf well in any miliou. If
    Mr. Williamson is ever less than diplomatic it is whon
    considering ersatz operational proposals or phoney
    practices, neither of which he can tolerate.

3.  There is no question that in his next assignment
    Mr. Williamson will benefit from the social graces of his
    charming wife. In his own private life Mr. Williamson
    maintains numerous important contacts.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 135

SECRET

4. In summary, Mr. Williamson is a dedicated and professional intelligence officer. He will undoubtedly continue his fine performance as a Chief of Station, and should in time be promoted to the next higher grade.

The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periods conducted by officials responsible for the missions, functions, programs, and services discussed. A few key items of suggested reading are included, and bibliographies of suggested reading tailored to the individual's assignment are offered for those who want them.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Memorandum in Lieu of Fitness Report -
Mr. Earl J. Williamson

1. Mr. Williamson reported to WH/Cuban Operations Group in February 1966 and immediately took over the functions of Chief of the FI Branch. This Branch is concerned with the conduct of positive intelligence operations on a world-wide basis against the Cuban target. A small proportion of these operations were conducted directly from Headquarters (including the direction of assets inside Cuba, a denied area). The larger number of these oporations was conducted through third countries and supervision involved the provision of staff support and guidance and extensive dealings with other Divisions and, to a losser degree, with representatives of foreign liaison services. Mr. Williamson took hold of these duties quickly and force- fully and carried them out effectively and efficiently.

2. In July 1966, Mr. Williamson was appointed Deputy Chief of the Cuban Operations Group. In this role his duties involved supervision of the totality of the operational effort, including FI, CI, maritime infiltrations, propaganda, political action, and economic warfare. Again, Mr. Williamson undertook his broader duties forcefully and efficiently. He has shown qualities of leadership and good managerial skills in dealing with porsonnel and organizational matters.

3. During this period, Mr. Williamson has primari- ly been interested in substantive operational matters. He has carried out officiently and promptly those staff functions which I have assigned to him, but I detect a certain lack of interest in these, Probably this reflects his most outstanding ability and con- suming interest in the real heart of our activities-- the production of intelligence and in the conduct of actions against our target. He has participated personally in several operations and is one of the relatively few senior officers who delights in handling agents and making recruitments.

4. Mr. Williamson is conscientious and economical in the use of operational assets, manpower and money. He is married to a charming young woman who is socially active, entertains well and is a real asset in representational activities.

5. Mr. Williamson's Spanish is fluent and colloquial, and in combination with his extensive understanding of Latin America and its people contributes enormously to his effectiveness.

Subject is departing Spain for an assignment PCS Headquarters following a tour of over five years at the Madrid Station. During the past three and one-half years he has headed up the Station's Cuban operations, has acted as a coordinator of Cuban activities in Western Europe and has actively participated in operations in support of other WE stations.

Starting completely from scratch, the Station was able, under Subject's able direction, to develop extensive operations against the priority Cuban target, including technical operations against the installation, recruitment and defection of important officials, penetration of commercial establishments, recruitment and training of internal assets, bi-lateral operations with the local services, etc.

Subject is an officer of considerable energy and drive. He has a knack of developing and exploiting interesting contacts and much of the success of the Station's Cuban program was due to his intimate connections in Cuban exile circles. Subject was also able to enlist the support of the local services in connection with certain aspects of the over-all program which could not be handled unilaterally.

Subject has shown himself to be "cost conscious" in the utilization of funds and manpower. His Cuban unit of the Station was

composed (in addition to himself) of four case officers, two reports officers and a secretary. Although he may be considered a "tough" supervisor in demanding the best of his subordinates, the record will show that he was able to build a very successful program.

During his tour at this Station, Subject made an important contribution toward the achievement of high priority targets. He is in every sense of the word an experienced, energetic and dedicated officer.

Since Subject's activities in support of other WE stations in the conduct of Cuban operations were under the direction of Headquarters, the rating box for this specific duty has been left blank for completion by the appropriate Headquarters official.

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify et explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

During the period under review Subject's activities in support of Cuban operations elsewhere In Europe and his responsibilities as Coordinator of Cuban activities for Western Europe have kept him away from the Madrid Station approximately one half of the twelve month period. Since these activities were under the direction of Headquarters, and not this Station, the rater does not feel qualified to comment on Subject's performance of Specific Duties 2 and 3 and has therefore left those rating boxes blank for completion by the appropriate Headquarters' official.

With respect to Specific Duty 1, supervision of Station's Cuban operations, Subject has applied himself aggressively and imaginatively to this task and the rater feels that Station's Cuban operations have been maintained at a high level and have been an important contribution to KUBARK'S world-wide effort against this priority target. Obviously Subject's frequent and prolonged absences from the Station have not permitted him to give this task his undivided attention or the day-to-day continuity that is so necessary and important.

In the conduct of the Station's Cuban operations Subject has direct supervision of four operations officers, one full time and one part time reports officer, and a secretary. Subject is an efficient organizer and supervisor. He thinks and writes clearly. He is fluent in Spanish. In the conduct of the extensive Cuban operations he has shown himself to be

I know subject and am thoroughly familiar with his work and performance. I concur in this report with one exception, namely the rating given subject for specific duty No. 6. Because of his travels which absented him from the Station for one-half of the past year, subject perforce was inadequately qualified to take charge of the station in the absence of the COS. Specializing on Cuban operations entirely, he has but a -limited knowledge of the station's other activities and considering only the effectiveness of his performance of this duty, I could not rate him higher than P. This is not a comment on his capability but rather an evaluation of his effectiveness in performance of this particular duty.

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

During the period under review Subject's duties and activities have continued to be concentrated on the Cuban target. Subject's performance of those duties has been eminently satisfactory and have received the recognition and commendation of Headquarters. Subject is an all-round operations officer with considerable experience and no significant weaknesses. His strengths are his aggressive approach to his operational responsibilities, his sound judgment and his complete dedication to duty. Due to Subject's energy and imagination the Madrid Station has been able to develop a highly effective and well-balanced program of Cuban operations. In addition Subject has spent a good part of his time in support of high level Cuban operations outside of Spain, assignments which he has carried out with a high degree of professionalism and success. In every sense Subject can be classified as a man of action.

In the conduct of the Cuban operations Subject has direct supervision of three operations officers, one reports officer, and one secretary. In addition he maintains indirect supervision of a debriefing center, an intelligence processing shop and all activities relating to the recruitment, training and dispatching of agents to the target country. Subject maintains contact with high level liaison officers whose cooperation and support are needed for a good part of our overall operations and the excellent cooperation we have received from those officials attests to the skill of Subject. Subject, of course, is fluent in Spanish. His drafting of cables and dispatches is excellent. Subject has at all times exhibited cost consciousness in the planning and execution of his operational responsibilities. In a word Subject is an excellent officer and a credit to the organization in every respect.

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

During the period under review, Subject's duties and activities have 2.55 PM #63 in the main devoted to the conduct of Cuban operations. His performance of those duties has been characterized by vigor and imagination. Concrete results have been achieved. The Station's performance in connection with all phases of this top priority activity, carried out under Subject's supervision, has been the subject of commendatory comments from Headquarters. In addition to direction the Station's own Cuban operations, Subject has been frequently called upon to support other Stations in connection with various phases of their Cuban operations, particularly in making both "warm" and "cold" approaches to high level diplomatic candidates for defection. These assignments have been undertaken by Subject with much enthusiasm and a high degree of professionalism. As a matter of fact, Subject was away from Madrid on these and similar missions for 120 days during calendar year 1962.

In the conduct of the Cuban operations, Subject has direct supervision over four officers and indirect supervision of the debriefing center, the intelligence processing shop and all activities relating to the recruitment, training and dispatching of agents. Through personal liaison with leading Spanish intelligence and security service officials, he has been most successful in obtaining their cooperation in support of our operations. In addition, Subject has expended much of his after-hours time to maintain-ing contact with agents and persons of operational interest.

Subject is fluent in Spanish. He is an efficient organizer and supervisor and thinks and writes clearly. In summary, he is an experienced, energetic and highly dedicated officer. While he is well qualified to take over his own Station, it is my hope, and recommendation, that he be given a second full tour here in Madrid. In my opinion, it (continued in Part 3 below)

SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Subject is a strong officer from every important point of view. He is experienced, intelligent, alert, aggressive, extremely hard working and conscientious. He is never satisfied with the status quo but is constantly striving to acquire new operational assets or to improve the functioning or production of old or current projects. He is tough-minded and abundantly endowed with intellectual as well as physical courage. If he has any one weakness, it is his impatience with subordinate officers and employees who do not tackle their operational duties with the same degree of zeal that he himself applies. His direct and forceful manner in calling such shortcomings to the attention of case officers under his direction has, on infrequent occasions, caused some minor and transitory resentment. In most cases, however, it has also resulted in improvement in the attitude and performance of the officer in question.

Subject is especially effective in his dealings with high level liaison officers and the fact that our relations with the various security services are currently on a cordial and more productive basis is due mainly to the thought, energy and time which Subject has devoted to this important activity. At the same time, subject has not permitted liaison considerations to inhibit the planning and development of independent operations and agents. In this connection he has been especially effective in developing valuable assets for third country (Cuban) operations.

Subject has an outgoing personality: makes friends easily, especially among Latins. He is a mature person who is respected by his Station colleagues and by the senior ODACID and other agency representatives with whom he maintains contact. He has direct supervision over nine officers and clerks. He is a good administrator. He writes effectively.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I fully endorse the evaluation and comments of the supervisor. Subject is noteworthy for his calculated aggressiveness, initiative and determination. His stewardship of the Madrid Station while he was Acting Chief was commendable. He reports well, is reasonable, and in my opinion has fully earned promotion to GS-15.

SECRE

As a well rounded operations officer and administrator, Subject is qualified to run his own station and, in my opinion, it would be an injustice to him if he is not assigned as chief of a medium sized station when his service in Spain is completed. It is my hope, however, that Subject will be given a second tour at Madrid when his current tour ends in October 1962.

This officer, who is Deputy Chief of Station and also Chief of Linicon, directly supervises a sizeable number of personnel involved in joint operable with liaison and directs the operations in which they are engaged. In the comparatively short time he has beenin this Station he has succeeded in making major advances in our liaison relationship to the point where we can now accomplish considerably more than before his arrival. He is energetic, imaginative, gets things done, and works round the clock - his off duty hours he employs mainly in developing further his liaison and other operational relationships. Furthermore, unlike some officers in liaison he is also most active developing independent operations. As for his qualities as a deputy, suffice it to say that he is the best deputy I have had in my entire career with this organization - a truly outstanding officer, as reflected in the numerical ratings I have given him, whom I would be glad to have with me any place I may be, assigned,

## SECTION IV

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree in most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks: this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left - then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual.

## TRAINING REPORT

MANAGERIAL GRID SEMINAR (50 hours) DATES: 23-28 April 1967

Student : Earl J. Williamson Office : WEI

Year of Birth: 1915 Service Designation D

Grade : 15 No. of Students : 46

EOD Date : June 1952

## COURSE OBJECTIVES AND METHOD

Course objectives are to aid participants to: learn the managerial theories contained in the Grid; understand their personal managerial styles in Grid terms; evaluate convictions about managerial values; develop team action skills; increase candidness of communication; strengthen the use of critique for problem-solving and learning; and acquire an appreciation of Organization Culture and Development.

The method of learning offers a challenge to all participants regardless of level or experienco. A Grid Seminar is not "taught" in the usual sense. In Grid teams, participants solve complex management problems. Objective solutions are made available. Individual and team performance is repeatedly assessed. Various measuring instruments are used to evaluato effectiveness.

Critique sessions assist each participant to understand how he might change his own behavior to increase his problem-solving effectiveness. Thus managers are not told the best way to manage, but they learn by convincing themselves,

About twenty to thirty hours cí study are completed as prowork, Insights gained are deepened and personalized during the intensive 50-hour Seminer.

## ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate student achievement in this course,

Subject has done an outstanding job at this Station during his four years in Madrid. I recommend that he be returned to this Station following home leave in view of the high priority given to his present duties and responsibilities and the obvious fact that the important program which he is now heading up would suffer greatly if he were to be rotated, at this time, to another assignment. When he is eventually transferred from Madrid I feel strongly that he should be given a chief of station assignment within the Division in view of his consistently fine record, his experience, maturity and devotion to duty.

Attachment: (1)

*Fidel Castro* published in 1959 by The New Bobbs-Merrill Company, an Associate of Howard W. Sams & Co., Inc. Indianapolis and New York


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 198

Platt Policy drastically modified it. When the Platt
Amendment, which had allowed U.S. government to intervene in
Cuba, was abolished In 1934.
There are diplomatic and military lessons to learn from the
recent civil war in Cuba. A policy of winning governments and
losing people must definitely be discarded if we are going to win
and maintain the sincere friendship of the people of Latin
America. We are looked upon as the champions of freedom (free-
dom of the people, by the people, and for the people) and our
message in that regard should be transmitted to the peoples of
all America.
The retention of the Military Mission in Cuba was a serious
mistake, compounded by the fact that there was a proviso in the
agreement that permitted their immediate withdrawal in the event
of a civil war. Yet it was stated that their continued presence
was necessary for hemisphere defense. In February 1959 the
Missions were withdrawn at the request of the Cuban government
because Castro felt that officers who trained in army he had
defeated could not teach him anything about warfare in this
country.
The Central Intelligence Agency understood, reported the
steady and inevitable collapse of the Batista regime and the indig
nation over the retention of the Military Missions. Did the other
government agencies who were responsible for coordinating
policy regarding Cuba make adequate and sensible use of this
evaluated intelligence? If not, why not?
And there were other members of the embassy staff in Havana
who did not spend all their after-office time at tasteless cooky-
pushing cocktail parties, but tied their cars to the ground and
developed friendships with the man in the streets; the student
and the rebel. Earl Williamson was one; and so is now in Wash
ington. And so was Gilberto Carranza, now on duty in Guatemala.
The Cuban people are grateful for their understanding and objec
tive approach to their problems, and their discreet inquiries which
helped save the lives of political prisoners.
No ambassador should be seen to pay poor tribute to corrupt offi
cials, to the swamps of the Country. A good information with Cuba
requires the sensitive ear of Ambassador Philip W. Bonsal.

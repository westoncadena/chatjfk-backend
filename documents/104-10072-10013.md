THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE US citizen, member of the chemistry department of a large US technical institute.

During the period 27 Sep to 23 Oct 61, Oleg V. Firmage, Soviet Exchange Scientist under the Franco-American Exchange agreement, was under the supervision of Kyasil'ev and members of his staff.

1. Alan Hislamovich Kasayev came to do part-time research work in the department of Chemistry under the supervision of Kyasel'ev and by association with Oleg V.. As came pursuant to the Franco-American Exchange agreement it was intended that he would work here for a period of three or five months. He had been here less than a month when his mother and sister, who departure occurred on 20 Oct 61. Prior to coming here, he had been a scientific associate of the Institute of Central Medicine, of the MOZH.

2. We were very much disturbed by Firmage's sudden departure because we feared that the whole exchange program might have been jeopardized. In 27 Oct 61, we sent a cable, to Professor Nikolay Nikolaevich Pirogov, a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, who is the Head of the Institute of Chemical Physics, Moscow, that Firmage had arrived. Professor replied to this cable with a cable which we received 11 Oct 61. He stressed that Firmage came back for family reasons. "We are extremely sorry," it said, "and will write a letter with details." However, we wrote a letter with details to date, 29 Nov 61.

3. Another cable was sent by the National Academy of Sciences of America, to Academician Engelgardt [Halluc.], president of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

4. As far as we are concerned, it is our view that Firmage's wife and family made him return to the USSR to get the pressure off his dependents.

5. I think his departure, therefore, is a very fine thing. We are going to try to get a continuation on him or any other Institute scientist that thought about this program.

6. Firmage fitted in very well here. We give him the title of visiting scientists.

that after remaining shortly in N. Y. than to return
to Europe with his family for reasons unknown. He had a
problem in a dentistry course at the Long Island College,
where we proposed to assist him. He made many friends. He is married and has a wife and two
children who sometimes come across the threshold. Cut off the
contacts. They are paying the threshold, I believe.

7. He was constantly impressed with Pirogov's activity and assigned him to a
   scientific research mission. He refused to sell information
   in the other institutions. He had not
   complete strength either. He refused well with all the other
   patientains. He did not want to take an initiative of loosening
   the restraint. As we in the event in the US.
   For example, he did not pretend that the Soviet system
   He was very promising for the Soviet system. In so that be
   we are very promising for the Soviet system, so that be

   the account of man who might have been brought over to
   useful. It may be that.
   joined in the Council of the Soviet Institutions and
   60th Street, New York City, may have reached the same conclusion. By
   his accounts may have brought about other reasons, for example,
   supported by his brother with leftist interests dating back to
   the International Astronomical Society and the
   Planetary Consortium.

8. Dr. Bykov was researching the institution and one of us thought it would be
   a good idea for Pirogov to meet Bykov. This one launched himself as a representative
   to explain when he introduced or "Pirogov of Moscow".
   Later, he became very German
   and Bykov said something in English like,
   "pleased to meet you."
   and something in Russia and other, in idea
   very strange visit. I understood that Pirogov grew pale,
   great, he was very driven either. I understood that at Pirogov grew pale,
   very strange visit. I understood that Pirogov grew pale,

   The same is of the park element for him to

10. Another thing that contributed to Pirogov's superstitions was the fact
    that he did not know his wife or family for reasons unknown. He was greatly concerned about wife. However, I believe he did have a letter
    from his wife just before he left.

11. My own feeling is that his popularity with our friends appears
    strange in the Dulochkin citizen. That some
    people in the community here. The shadows
    of the party of the community here.
    with them. That most of my customers under
    degree, Pirogov, joined the party and other
    part of time to have a hazily of human
    being.

12. In my opinion, Pirogov's experience with make out for their system, even though he was
    that a good program.
    not submit to omit that the Soviet system.

12. Gay thought he talked too much and his mouth shut and he did not act like (as) he was susceptible to conversion.

13. Do bad to report to the Council that Pliny was on his own. In the present, felt she had abandoned much. His conversation with Andrey was very often ahead to what he had been. Council my have urged to the conversation is over.

15. We are now seeing a transition which he would be one of the contradictions in which he would die, and the alpha statues, prayers.

16. He was known to many of the state and not intimate with the students here but was probably not intimate with two or fifteen. Such intimate with the men with whom he shared a laboratory. Like was an Italian, named by Pacific Pisciotta.

17. I do not think that Pliny were the victims of an intimacy. I have wondered about them a lot but I do not think this is what happened. I think, as I said before, that he dug his own hole. Incidentally, we were most anxious to keep such incidents out of the papers and there was no leak. But there has been the case.

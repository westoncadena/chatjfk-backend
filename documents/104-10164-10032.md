BLOCK was carrying American passport No. 921617, issued 12 April 1956 but changed by him to read 12 April 1958 so that is would appear to be still valid. Morris BLOCK was refused entry to The Netherlands on the basis of his falsified passport. The American Consulate in Amsterdam validated his passport for a single return trip to New York, and he was sent back to New York on a KLM plane at 2359 hours on 30 August 1958.

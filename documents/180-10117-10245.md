II. Summary of Contact:

In re: Former SS Agent Abraham Bolden DOB 1/19/35; Social Security No. 330-28-2266. A trace of Abraham Bolden's prison record was developed from a newspaper article found in the LBJ Library which mentioned initial incarceration in Springfield, Mo. Mr. Bolden was transferred from Springfield to Maxwell Field Federal Prison Camp (Montgomery, Alabama) and was placed on parole in September of 1959. Maxwell retained no records except for an indication that at some time Bolden stated that he had had "a residence in Chicago." This lead suggested that an inquiry be made to the Federal Probation service for the Chicago area.

Coincidentally, Mr. Foster was the probation officer who personally supervised Mr. Bolden while Bolden was on probation. (cont.)

Foster remarked that the Bolden case was unique in his experience because of the nondisclosure by authorities of information that is automatically released to the probation officer in a given case.

Specifically, in every other case which Mr. Foster has processed, the prosecutor gave the probation officer a "version," i.e., a recital of fact about the crime and the circumstances surrounding it. Only in cases where an undercover informant is under parole supervision is the name of the informant withheld, but even then a version is always presented despite the witholding of the name. In Bolden's case, the prosecutor gave the probation officer only the indictment. Bolden's prosecutor was named Richard T. Sykes.

Mr. Foster's statement about Mr. Bolden's record while under parole supervision was that Mr. Bolden violated parole by talking to the media in order to convey his information that the Secret Service knew about the assassination three or four weeks before Dallas. However, for reasons which were not disclosed either to Mr. Foster or on the record Mr. Bolden's parole status was not revoked. Foster recounted that his records show that Bolden's statement was published in the April 12, 1970 Chicago Sun-Times.

Mr. Foster also set forth certain materials about Mr. Bolden's prosecution and conviction, supplying enough detail to make clear that at least one of the witnesses upon whose testimony the conviction was based subsequently recanted his testimony. The recantation, however, did not enable Bolden

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Plans

THROUGH: Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: Indications of the Scope and Possible Damage of New Allegations by *Ramparts* Magazine

1. This memorandum is furnished for information only.

2. Early in April 1968 the Office of the General Counsel made available to Central Cover Staff (CCS) a copy of a letter and an attached list of organizations sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by Mr. Jon Frappier of *Ramparts Magazine*. The letter, dated 5 April 1968, had been furnished CGC through IRS liaison channels. The letter appended a list of 145 tax-exempt organizations and indicated that all were suspected of having been funded by or having cooperated with CIA.

3. The letter indicated that the listed organizations were only a part of the organizations being scrutinized by *Ramparts* and that other available sources of information on these and other suspect organizations had already been examined. The other sources of information were stated as including the literature of the organizations and interviews with their staff members; records available in the Attorney General's offices in Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York; data available at the National Information Bureau in New York, Group Research, Inc., in Washington, D.C., and the Foundation Library Centers in New York and Washington; and the 990-A returns available at the district offices of the IRS. The letter requested 990-A

-2-

returns for specified years and in most cases the Form 1023
Application for Tax Exempt Status. *Ramparts* asked the IRS
to make these materials available for inspection at a mutu-
ally convenient time.

4. A review of available CIA data on the listed organi-
   zations has shown that 89 of them were at one time or another
   somehow associated with CIA. Only two of these

are of current operational interest. These two activities
and 45 organizations formerly of interest to CIA were men-
tioned in the American press during [MHDOWEL]. Of Forty-two
other listed organizations which were in fact associated
✓ with CIA were not exposed during (MHDOWELL. We have found no
evidence that 55 organizations on the list were ever directly
or indirectly associated with CIA. (Because two of the names
on the list are successive names for the same organization,
the actual total number of organizations listed is 144 rather
than 145.) Three additional project organizations, not
included in the *Ramparts* list, may be vulnerable because
they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed foundation
funding instruments included in the list. Only one of these,
is of cur-
rent operational interest.

5. The CA Staff was furnished a copy of the *Ramparts*
   letter and list and has checked out the organizations of
   possible previous CA Staff interest. All organizations not
   readily identifiable with known project organizations or as
   CCS funding instruments have been traced with RID, with CS
   area divisions that might logically have had an interest in
   them and against CCS Registry files. Through arrangements
   with the IRS, representatives of CCS and CGC also examined
   available IRS data (990-A's and Forms 1023) on the listed
   organizations. This was done before the IRS documents were
   made available to *Ramparts*, in order to be sure that restricte
   990-A, Part I data would not be furnished to *Ramparts* and to
   try to establish the reasons for *Ramparts'* interest in the
   organizations. Our current findings are the results of these
   various file reviews.

6. Attached hereto are annexes listing and discussing
   the several categories of organizations on the *Ramparts* list.
   Annex A deals with the two organizations on the list which
   are still of active operational interest. Both received


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 4

-3-

press mention during [NHDOWEL]. Annex B lists and discusses under several sub-categories the 42 organizations with which the Agency has had some direct or indirect operational ties in the past which were not cited in the press during - 이 DOWEL. Annex C lists the 45 organizations included in the April 1968 list which had former Agency operational ties which were subject to press allegations during MHDOWEL.0/ Annex D lists and briefly discusses the 55 organizations included in the Ramparts list that had no known operational connection with CIA. Annex E lists and discusses three hitherto unexposed operational activities that are not included in the April 1968 Ramparts list but which are vulnerable because they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed funding instruments included in the Ramparts list. Annex F shows a copy of the full April 1968 Ramparts list.

7. The 42 former project organizations listed and described at Annex B which have not previously been charged with CIA association in American press comment fall into five general categories:

a. Foundations and other organizations used as witting funding conduits for covert subsidies to project organizations and other operational activities. Sixteen organizations fall into this category. Eleven of them are multipurpose legitimate foundations. which were recuited by CCS. Four were created or recruited for exclusive use in funding one project each and one was used for a one-time travel grant.

b. Witting legitimate foundations and organizations used exclusively to provide funding and status cover for singleton agents. Six organizations were used in this way and provided cover for seven agents in various parts of the world. Some of these organizations also provided one-time support for unwitting individuals of operational interest.

c. Proprietary or subsidy project organizations. There are six of these: Projects CAMANTILLA WUHUSTLER FOCLPROOF, ETNAMABLE, SGPANFISH, and AESTRIKER.

d. Three organizations with which there were witting operational contacts to obtain information and leads but which were not actively involved operationally.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 5

-4-

e. Eleven unwitting organizations which received grants from project organizations for operational or cover reasons or which cooperated with project organizations.

8. We cannot say with complete assurance that all 55 of the apparently innocent organizations on the *Ramparts* list in fact never had any Agency ties. Our researches have shown that RID indices are often incomplete. We have found operational use data in CCS files on organizations with no record in RID. The same is true in other cases where information was available in CA Staff or area division files on organizations which drew a blank in RID. It seems likely, however, that any undetected operational interest in the organizations was in the period of the early 1950's and of a marginal nature.

9. In reviewing available information on the listed organizations we attempted to determine whether there was a logical external basis for *Ramparts'* interest in the organizations or whether some form of internal Agency leak might be involved. Our reviews and analysis show fairly conclusively that *Ramparts* has been proceeding on the basis of overtly available information, supplemented by interviews with project personnel:

a. All but three of the 42 terminated but hitherto unexposed project organizations and 24 of the 55 organizations which actually had no Agency ties are somehow related to project organizations or funding instruments previously exposed. Some of the organizations made legitimate or covert grants to previously exposed organizations, others received covert or legitimate grants from previously exposed funding instruments or from innocent foundations that had made legitimate grants to exposed organizations, and still others had officers who were associated with exposed CIA organizations.

b. Thirty-one innocent organizations on the *Ramparts* list and three of the hitherto unexposed organizations of former interest to the Agency have no such known ties to exposed Agency organizations. In most of these cases, however, the names of the organizations are similar to those of exposed organizations or are of a nature that makes them suspect.

10. It seems likely that *Ramparts'* interest in a number of the 42 unexposed project organizations is based on factors unrelated to the actual CIA dealings with them.

11. The Headquarters elements that are or were responsible for the projects and activities that could be implicated by new *Ramparts* allegations have been notified of the foregoing findings. No further action is required at this time.

## Three Organizations with Which There Have Been Some Witting Contacts

29. 
30. International Rescue Committee, Inc. (IRC) - Manhattan, New York (93)

Under Project QKGAUNT, $2,500 was furnished IRC in 1950 - 1951 to obtain biographic data on defectors. In December 1962, IRC Chairman Leo Cherne offered cover and FI use of IRC to Emmons Brown, DC/CA. C/EE declined the offer, indicating there already were useful contacts.

IRC received legitimate grants from J. Frederick Brown Foundation (34) and J. M. Kaplan Fund (101).

4.  A review of available CIA data on the listed organi-
    zations has shown that 89 of them were at one time or another

    for International Youth Affairs* (CA/B3 Project QRTROW) and
    *African-American Labor Center, Inc.* (CA/B4 Project QRSTUMP)7
    are of current operational interest. These two activities
    and 45 organizations formerly of interest to CIA were men-

    other listed organizations which were in fact associated
    with CIA were not exposed during MHDOWEL. We have found no

    on the list are successive names for the same organization,
    the actual total number of organizations listed is 144 rather

    included in the *Ramparts* list, may be vulnerable because
    they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed foundation
    funding instruments included in the list. Only one of these,
    *World Veterans Federation* (CA/B3 Project TPGLARE) is of cur-
    rent operational interest.

5. The CA Staff was furnished a copy of the *Ramparts*
   letter and list and has checked out the organizations of
   possible previous CA Staff interest. All organizations not
   readily identifiable with known project organizations or as

ANNEX A

ORGANIZATIONS ON 5 APRIL 1968 RAMPARTS LIST

THAT ARE OF CURRENT OPERATIONAL INTEREST

1.  [African-American Labor Center, Inc., (AALC), Manhattan, New York (2) 08

    CA/B4 Project QRSTUMP. Irving Brown (T) continues as AALC Executive Director and uses this relationship as status cover for operational travels in African and Europe. Although covert funding of AALC has been suspended, black-bag payments to Brown and by him to operational contacts may be implicitly attributed to AALC.

AALC received press publicity during MHDOWEL. Brown was named as a CIA agent in the Braden Saturday Evening Post article.

2.  Institute for International Youth Affairs, Manhattan, New York (IIYA) (79) 08

    CA/B3 Project QRTROW. Under Katzenbach guidelines and DDP decisions, IIYA was to be re-established abroad as a condition for continuation of the project. Various possibilities in Europe have been explored and vetoed. Steps are currently being taken to relocate the activity in Belgium.

    IIYA received limited press mention during MHDOWEL and only in the context of its Free Europe Committee origins and its former funding by the International Development Foundation (terminated WH Project (COALIBI) (88).

    IIYA is vulnerable because of its former funding by the Colt (41) and Ronthelym (129) Foundations, as well as by the Helena Rubinstein Foundation (not on the 5 April 1968 list but of known interest to Ramparts) and by the Florence (58) and W. Alton Jones (99) Foundations (exposed during MHDOWEL).

The Institute was subsequently used on an unwitting working-level basis as a conduit for funds attributed to the State Department to support a Soviet realities breifing center in New York City under SB Project AECOMITAS.

GAI is overtly tied to exposed organizations because Kirkpatrick of APSA (23) and OPR (119) (JMTUBA/IUEXTEND) and Gulick of IPA (84) were GAI board members. [GAI] has received legitimate grants from the Carnegie Endowment (35).

APSA served as the ostensible sponsor of travel by Bek Bahadur Thapa (T) from California to D.C. for the July 1959 APSA annual meeting. Funding was via other channels.

APSA was used in October 1965 as the point of contact in D.C. for an individual whose travel to the U.S. was sponsored by TAF (DTPILLAR).

## Six Project Organizations

23. American Friends of Refugees, Inc. (AFR) - Manhattan, New York (13)

Instrumentality of Project ARMANTILLA/CAMANTILLA which provided resettlement support of Defector Reception Center in Germany.

The P/A, Augustus G. Elmendorf (T), was also an officer of the Tolstoy Foundation (138) and International Research on Communist Techniques (95) (AESTRIKER). AFR was funded by the exposed San Jacinto Fund.

23ª American Friends of Russian Freedom - Manhattan, New York (14)

Former name of American Friends of Refugees, Inc. (23). (See above.)

24. International Research on Communist Techniquest (IRCT) - Manhattan, New York (95)

Successor organization to Committee to Combat Soviet Kidnapping (CCSK) (AEPROCESS) which was established in 1954 at the initiative of Vladimir Rudin, head of the American branch of the Russian emigre organization NTS following the Khokhlov affair. (NTS was and is subsidized under SB/CA Project AEGIDEON. CCSK changed its name to IRCT The two organizations successively received sterile grants under Project AESTRIKER, FY 1954 - 1956, at $14,585 a year. IRCT published a magazine, *Behind the Soviet Lines*, which was distributed in the U.S. and the U.K. to generate opposition to Soviet acts of violence.

In addition to Rudin, IRCT officers included Augustus G. Elmendorf (T) (who was also associated with AFR) (12) Project CAMANTILLA) and the Tolstoy Foundation (138) and Eugene Lyons (T) (former president of American Committee for Liberation of the Peoples of the USSR) (Project QKACTIVE) Its attorney was John F. B. Mitchell, Jr. (T), former OGC staffer and currently the backstop for Victoria Projects, an entity under DO Project WUPSYCHE.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 22

25. Freedom Fund, Inc. - Manhattan, New York

Established under SB Project AEMIRROR and transferred around 1962 to DO as Project WUHUSTLER, CIA support terminated in 1967. Headed from its Inception by Carl T. Chadsey, Jr. (T), it was used until 1961 as a funding channel for the NTS (Project AEGIDEON), as well as a propaganda outlet.

Freedom Fund, Inc. was covertly funded by the Branta (32) Renthelym (129), J. Frederick Brown (34), and Pappas Foundations. The latter two were exposed during MHDOWEL.

26. International Research Institute, Inc. - Princeton, New Jersey (94)

This is probably a new name for the International Institute for Social Research (IISR) in Princeton, New Jersey, which was cited in the New York Times on 26 October 1958 as receiving funds from the subsequently exposed Dearborn Foundation (49). Dearborn provided substantial covert funds, 1955 - 1962, to the Research Council, Inc. (as affiliate of the Princeton University Office of Public Opinion Research) for IISR under RQM/OIS Project FOOLPROOF for in-depth opinion studies carried out by Lloyd Free (T) and Hadley Cantril (T) in selected countries throughout the world.

In 1961, through a clerical error, Dearborn (49) checks for FOOLPROOF and HTHAMABLE (see below) were reversed, making these organizations mutually witting.

27. Scientific Engineering Institute, Inc. (SEI) - Cambridge, Massachusetts (132)

DD/S&T proprietary Project HTNAMABLE. Ramparte has recently sought to interview some of the project principals. SEI has special sensitivity because of its prestigious and well-connected principals. It was covertly funded through the Colt (41), Magowan (108), Sunnen (135), W. Alton Jones (99), Dearborn (49), and Ridgefield Foundations. Its own 1966 990-A will show grants of $1,245,000 to Dearborn (49), Jones (99), Magowan (10g), Sunner (135), and Ridgefield Foundations.

29. [American Universities Field Staff, Inc. (AUFS)] - Manhattan, New York (25)

[Kermit Roosevelt] had contact in 1950 with [AUFS Execu- tive Director, Philip Talbot (T)], on possible cover use of [AUFS]. In 1956, 00/Contacts reported a continuing re- lationship with [AUFS] for exchange of information. There apparently was some covert exploitation until Book Dis- patch No. [5167] of 4 October 1965 prohibited further use. [Henry M. Wriston (T)], President of AURS and of [Brown University] was contacted in 1952 on use of a separate [Brown University] facility for agent cover.

30. International Rescue Committee, Inc. (IRC) - Manhattan, New York (93)

Under Project QKGAUNT, $2,500 was furnished IRC in 1950 - 1951 to obtain biographic data on defectors. In December 1962, IRC Chairman Leo Cherne offered cover and FI use of IRC to Emmons Brown, DC/CA. C/EE declined the offer, indicating there already were useful contacts.

IRC received legitimate grants from J. Frederick Brown Foundation (34) and J. M. Kaplan Fund (101).

Cooperated with the Interchange Foundation headed by Anna Lord Strauss and Mrs. Harvey Picker of CC (44)
(Project JEFERVENT) in what proved an abortive effort under a joint CA-SR project to sponsor the U.S. visit of a group of prominent Soviet women. Interchange Foundation received $3,579 from the Independence Foundation (75) for its share. The funds were redirected to a feasibility survey on establishing an international women's organization.

Public Information Division
Internal Revenue Service
1111 Constitution Ave., N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20224

Dear Mr. Rosapepe:

Ramparts Magazine is under contract to McGraw-Hill Publishing Company to produce a book dealing with organizations that were funded by or cooperated with the Central Intelligence Agency. We have already obtained much of the background information on these organizations from the following sources:

1) Inspection of the organization's literature and interviews with their staff members;
2) Inspection of records obtained from the Charitable Organizations Division of the Attorney General's office in the states of Illinois, Massachusetts and New York;
3) The National Information Bureau in New York;
4) The Foundation Library in New York and Washington, D.C.; and
5) Group Research, Inc. in Washington, D.C.

In order to complete the research, it is very important for us to inspect the 990-A tax forms of organizations which, for various reasons, we have been unable to inspect at the district offices of the Internal Revenue Service.

Following your suggestion during our telephone conversation, we are submitting an alphabetical list which includes the location of the organization and the years of the 990-A forms that we still need to inspect. All of the organizations listed appears in *Cumulative List- Organizations Described in Section 170 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, Publication No. 78 (Revised to December 31, 1956)*, and the *Supplement No. 1967-5*.

Although this is a sizeable list, we have narrowed it to the most essential organizations currently under investigation. We will call next week to clarify any questions you may have and to make an appointment for the inspection. If it is agreeable with you, several of our researchers will come to your Washington office when the files are ready, so that we may complete the work as quickly as possible.

If there are any questions of an immediate nature, my telephone number is (212) 222-1116.

Respectfully yours,

Jon Frappier

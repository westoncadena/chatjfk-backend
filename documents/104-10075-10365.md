C/S COMMENT: RE EXFILTRATION OF AMFAUNA-25 FROM CUBA.

1. BELIEVE IT CURRENTLY APPROPRIATE REVIEW AMFAUNA-25 SITUATION WITHIN FRAMEWORK THOSE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE SINCE REF FORWARDED. SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS ARE:

A. WAVE ACTION RESULTED EXFILTRATION AMFAUNA-14 AND THUS DIRECT THREAT SECURITY AMFAUNA-35, AMFAUNA-39. BERNARDO (ALVAREZ) NOW AND EDUARDO VEGA HAS BEEN ELIMINATED AS INITIAL DEBRIEFING ABFAUNA-14 REVEALS THESE AGENTS NOT KNOWN DSE. WILL ATTEMPT CONFIRM THIS INITIAL DEBRIEFING CONCLUSION VIA FLUTTER EXAM. IT APPEARS HOWEVER THAT OUR REMEDIAL ACTION HAS NOT ONLY AVERTED POSSIBLE FLAP BUT HAS KEPT VIARLE ASSETS IN PLACE.

B. WAVE ATTEMPTS EXFIL ANCUTLER-2 WERE NOT PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE ANCUTLER-2 REFUSED LEAVE CUBA WHEN WE OFFERED HE. THIS OPPORTUNITY. THIS DUE FACT HER MOTHER SERIOUSLY ILL.

REMOVAL ARCUTLER-2 FROM CUBA STILL RENAINS PRIORITY TASK AS IFAUNA-14 DEBRIEFING CONFIRMS WAVE'S RELIOUS ANALYSIS THAT ARCUTLER-2 IS PRIME CANDIDATE FOR IMMEDIATE ARREST. HER ARREST WOULD LEAD TO ARREST ANFAUNA'S 4, 10, 15, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37 AND 38. WAVE INTENDS RAKE MAXIMIM

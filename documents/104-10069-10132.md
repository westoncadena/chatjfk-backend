VIA AIE

To: Chief of Station, Phnom Penh Info: Chief, FE

From: Chief of Station, Viet Nam

Subject: General: Operational/PG HIM JUA

Specific: Information concerning Idem A

ACTION REQUIRED: None

In answer to request of Gregory O. SAKMAR, the following is a composite of information from VERNON P. ELLIS (TOFUEN) (IDET B) and VERNON N. KERKER (ISIC) concerning Idem A.

1. Description of subjects: between 35 and 40 years old, about 6 feet tall, rather bald, small mustache, very strong and vigorous, fine skin to teeth, Jewish. Speaks quite good English. He is married and has one 9 or 10-year-old daughter. He has a sister in New York who is a naturalized American citizen. [photo of sister of subject] says subject speaks well, loves fine music, has an impressive library, reads continuously and paints very well.

2. Early during the war he was deported as a Jew to a German concentration camp (tattooed prisoner's identification number on right forearm--9714), where he spent several horrible years and survived only by luck. Since 1946 he has spent most of his time in Indochina and was apparently in intelligence or related fields most of the time. TOFUEN reports that the first HUARI rep in Hanoi 1950-51 was sucked in by an offer from subject to mount combined operations and was shortly afterwards declared persona non grata by the French.

3. Subject took part as a civilian in the Atlanta Operation, et, according to one report, went in with vast sums of money to make propaganda, buy off the opposition, etc. VILLIERS-1 (Idem A) and HANKEN (Idem B) considered Idem A's accomplishment in Central Viet Nam among the few notable achievements in that area, particularly in respect to his contribution to the Vietnamese pacification program which he coordinated throughout the course of Operation Atlanta.

4. Subject is an old friend of (Col.) Langwartenal, former chief of Wili. He was for a time (June-August 1953) in the National Security Division, during which time he proposed to VILLIERS joint operations-pool resources and experience (similar to Hanoi proposal, above) but VILLIERS refused, considered proposal pre-ventative maneuver.

5. March-April 1954 subject approached Station and USAID for military support for program to support nucleus of a people's militia (garde mobile) in the Hoa Binh Trang area. Information and correspondence on this proposal will be sent upon request.

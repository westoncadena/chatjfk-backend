By virtue of this application for membership and upon my acceptance in the Career Staff, I am assured that, with continuing satisfactory work performance and conduct on my part, just and equitable attention will be accorded my personal progress during my tenure in the Career Staff. I am also assured that, on my satisfactory completion of any assignments, I will be offered reassignments which are compatible insofar as possible with my abilities and career interests, and that I shall be entitled to the benefits now available or to be made available in the future to members of the Career Staff of the Central Intelligence Agency.

The first thing of note is the scattered work and educational history of this fellow. On paper the case is all against him but in talking to him I conclude that it is the case of a guy who failed to get the proper job and school guidance when it would have been most effective (immediately after discharge). The guy has intelligence (LA/5 61-81) but perhaps not the final grasp of things to make a go of a technical degree in College. He probably would have done O.k. with the Liberal Arts course. At any rate he has decided on accounting as a career (finds he likes it and can do it well). He's had a tough life to say the least (how much bearing this has had on his career I'm not trained to evaluate.) My final impression is that he's neat, clean cut, sincere, reliable, capable if given the proper supervision. Types about 40 wpm and is learning shorthand from his wife (who's applying as steno). I think he'd do a competent job and perhaps with experience and training do a very good one. Wants O/S at earliest opportunity for financial reasons.

JUL 15 10 37 AM '66

During the period Subject was in charge of the Payroll Section at JUWAVE his performance was, in the rater's opinion, not more than adequate. He apparently was of the opinion that being in charge of a section relieved him of the onerous tasks of filing and other related duties of like nature. As far as meeting the payroll deadlines Subject was proficient in this duty, but he normally required considerable amount of overtime work to meet these deadlines. He had many ideas which he presented to Chief, Finance Branch for betterment of the payrolling system, but unfortunately after due consideration the majority of these ideas were found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good accepted commercial practice or Agency regulations. Suggestions made to him were outwardly accepted but upon follow-up it was determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions. Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject was barely adequate in performing his assigned tasks.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Mr. Wilcott is very serious to prove his capabilities. Accordingly, he frequently assumes additional duties other than those assigned to him. He is very attentive to his work, is diligent in applying himself to the job, he is very quiet by nature and it is only on rare occasions that he indulges in conversation unrelated to his duties. He is attempting to become better acquainted with government accounting as has been evidenced by his enrollment in an accounting course with the Department of Agriculture School. He has made great progress in his assigned position in the Accounting Branch.

1 - DEFINITELY UNSUITABLE - HE SHOULD BE SEPARATED

It is believed that no doubt he could adapt himself to other duties in the F.M. Accounting.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give Office of persioning. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in S. Provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If coma space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

During the period Subject was in charge of the Payroll Section at JMWAVE his performance was, in the rater's opinion, not more than adequate. He apparently was of the opinion that being in charge of a section relieved him of the onerous tasks of filing and other related duties of like nature. As far as meeting the payroll deadlines Subject was proficient in this duty, but he normally required considerable amount of overtime work to meet these deadlines. He had many ideas which he presented to Chief, Finance Branch for betterment of the payrolling system, but unfortunately after due consideration the majority of these ideas were found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good accepted commercial practice or Agency regulations. Suggestions made to him were outwardly accepted but upon follow-up it was determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions. Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject was barely adequate in performing his assigned tasks.

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Mr. Wilcott is very anxious to prove his capabilities. Accordingly, he frequently assumes additional duties other than those assigned to him. He is very attentive to his work, is diligent in applying himself to the job, he is very quiet by nature and it is only on rare occasions that he indulges in conversation unrelated to his duties.

He has made great progress in his assigned position in the Accounting Branch.

2 - OF DOUBTFUL SUITABILITY...WOULD NOT HAVE ACCEPTED HIM IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I KNOW NOW

3 - A BARELY ACCEPTABLE EMPLOYEE...BELOW AVERAGE BUT WITH NO WEAKNESSES SUFFICIENTLY OUTSTANDING TO WARRANT HIS SEPARATION

4 - OF THE SAME SUITABILITY AS MOST PEOPLE I KNOW IN THE ORGANIZATION

5 - A FINE EMPLOYEE - HAS SOME OUTSTANDING STRENGTHS

6 - AN UNUSUALLY STRONG PERSON IN TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION

7 - EXCELLED. BY ONLY A FEW IN SUITABILITY FOR WORK IN THE ORGANIZATION

[ ] YES  [X] NO. IF YES, EXPLAIN FULLY:

He is well suited for his present position, but has expressed a desire for an opportunity to serve in an overseas assignment, as this was a part of his ambition in seeking employment with the Agency. It is believed that he could readily adapt himself to other duties in the field of accountancy.

# CONVENTION

The Committee on Conventions met on June 15, 1966, at 9:30 a.m. Members present were as follows:

Senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr., Chairman

Senator John Warren Cooke

Delegate James M. Thomson

Delegate Archibald A. Campbell

Mr. Lewis F. Powell, Jr.

The Committee had previously sent letters to those persons and organizations that have expressed an interest in the Convention question. Replies were received which set forth the views of these people. The Committee reviewed these replies and discussed generally the question of a Convention. It was the consensus of the Committee that it would be wise to have a legal expert make a study of this question with particular emphasis on the following questions:

(1) In the call for a Convention, is it possible for the General Assembly to limit the scope of the Convention? In other words, can the General Assembly call a Convention to deal only with one or more specified items?

(2) If the General Assembly calls a Convention and limits its scope, is there any way in which the Convention can exceed the limitations established by the General Assembly?

(3) What would be the effect of any action taken by the Convention that was outside the scope of the Convention call? Would such action be void or would it be valid unless and until it was challenged in court?

(4) If the General Assembly should call a Convention, what is the procedure for determining who shall be delegates to the Convention? Is it possible for the General Assembly to prescribe the method of selecting the delegates?

(5) If the General Assembly should prescribe a method of selecting delegates, is there any way in which the Convention could change this method? Could the Convention provide for additional delegates to be appointed or selected in some other manner?

(6) If a Convention is held and submits to the people a proposed new Constitution, would this new Constitution become effective immediately upon its ratification by the people, or would it be necessary for the General Assembly to take some action before the new Constitution could become effective?

(7) After a Convention has submitted to the people a proposed new Constitution, is it possible for the General Assembly to alter or amend any provision of the new Constitution prior to its submission to the people for ratification?

(8) After a Convention has adjourned, does the General Assembly have the power to fill any vacancies that may occur in the list of delegates?

The Committee asked Mr. Powell to suggest someone who could make the study and prepare a memorandum on these questions. Mr. Powell stated that he would be glad to take this under advisement and recommend someone at the next meeting of the Committee.

There being no further business, the Committee adjourned subject to the call of the Chairman.

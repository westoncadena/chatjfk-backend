FOR THE RECORD

FROM: Kammer

1 Feb. 1961

SUBJECT: [STRATTON, Michael Weimer]
#188074

1.  On this date Subject's case was coordinated with Mr. McCORD of SRS in connection with Subject's operational use within the US by WH/4/Propaganda. The implications of a CI operation with the States by this Agency and the possibility Subject might come to the attention of the FBI through association with Court WOOK were discussed.

2.  Mr. McCORD expressed the opinion that it is not necessary to advise the FBI of the operation at this time. However, he wishes to review the case in a month. The file of Subject, along with that of the WH man who is supervising the operation (David Atlee PHILLIPS # 40695) will be pended for the attention of Mr. McCORD on 1 March 1961.

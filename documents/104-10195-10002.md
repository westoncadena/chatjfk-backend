MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

VIA: Deputy Director for Operations

FROM: Chief, European Division

SUBJECT: Request for Extension of the Services of Thomas B. CASASIN (P), Retired Annuitant, under a Memorandum of Oral Commitment

1. Action Requested: Your approval is requested to extend the services of Thomas B. CASASIN (P) under a Memorandum of Oral Commitment for the period 1 July 1975 to 31 December 1977. The only compensation to CASASIN would be money equivalent to shipment costs for a maximum of 1,000 pounds of personal effects from Paris, France, to the United States. Since CASASIN is an Independent Contractor, the amount of money given CASASIN will be considered taxable income for tax year 1977.

2. Basic Data and Background: CASASIN, born 20 January 1924, has been employed by the Agency since 1949. Twelve years of this period were spent as a Staff Employee, seven of which were at Headquarters and five years, 1955-1960, were spent in Tokyo. In 1962 CASASIN was assigned to Paris under nonofficial cover as a Staff Agent. In 1972 he was converted to Career Associate status to coincide with his cover employment with UNESCO, a position he attained on his own initiative. CASASIN retired as a GS-15, Step 10, on 30 June 1974 and with proper Headquarters approvals was utilized by Paris Station as an Independent Contractor, effective 1 July 1974. His compensation was in accordance with the 90 percent provision of HR 20-13 a(1) (c) (1).

3. Staff Position: Due to his growing employment involvement at UNESCO, CASASIN requested, and the Paris Station agreed, not to renew his written Independent Contract, due for renewal 1 July 1975. However, since CASASIN is willing to meet informally

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 14

# SECRET

with the Station, the Station requests a Memorandum of Oral Commitment to be effective for the period CASASIN remains in UNESCO's employ, which is expected to terminate in 1977. CASASIN's experience as an Operations Officer and, specifically, experience and operational contacts derived through his present employment position in Paris are sufficiently valued by the Paris Station to request the continuation of CASASIN's services under a Memorandum of Oral Commitment.

4. Recommendation: Your approval is requested to continue CASASIN's services under a Memorandum of Oral Commitment for the period 1 July 1975 to 31 December 1977 with total compensation being money equivalent to the cost of shipping a maximum of 1,000 pounds of personal effects from Paris, France, to the United States.

SECTION B. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

U-Unsatisfactory

Performance is unacceptable. A rating in this category requires immediate and positive remedial action. The nature of the action could range from counseling, to further training, to placing on probation, to reassignment or to separation. Describe action taken or proposed in Section C.

M-Marginal

Performance is deficient in some aspects. The reasons for assigning this rating should be stated in Section C and remedial actions taken or recommended should be described.

P-Proficient

Performance is satisfactory. Desired results are being produced in the manner expected.

S-Strong

Performance is characterized by exceptional proficiency.

O-Outstanding

Performance is so exceptional in relation to requirements of the work and in comparison to the performance of others doing similar work as to warrant special recognition.

SPECIFIC DUTIES

List up to six of the most important specific duties performed during the rating period. Insert rating letter which best describes the manner in which employee performs EACH specific duty. Consider ONLY effectiveness in performance of that duty. All employees with supervisory responsibilities MUST be rated on their ability to supervise (indicate number of employees supervised).

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT : Thomas B. CASASIN

PERIOD COVERED: January - June 1974

Although I have been the Station case officer for Subject only since January 1974, I have been acquainted with his performance for the Station for the past 5 1/2 years through my assignment in the French Branch at Headquarters and, for the past 2 1/2 years, as the Station officer responsible for UNCAIRD operations. I have always considered CASASIN to be a highly skilled, experienced senior case officer thoroughly devoted to the work of BKHERALD. He is becoming increasingly effective in his present cover position at UNCAIRD, operating against both Soviet and PRC targets, and I am delighted that he has agreed to continue his cooperation with the Station as a field agent following his retirement from BKHERALD effective 30 June 1974. CASASIN can look back with pride over his years of service with BKHERALD but he can also look forward to additional years of highly useful, productive work for Paris Station.

CASASIN's attitude can best be summed up by a comment on my first operational meeting with him following his official retire- ment. He instinctively went immediately to a discussion of operations, not of retirement. I am confident that CASASIN will continue to be a highly motivated, effective asset of Paris Station, and I wish him well.

SECTION-D

The attached Memorandum in Lieu of a Fitness Report should be read in conjunction with the NOC Status Report on Subject for the period ending 31 March 1974; these reports overlap somewhat in the period covered. As has been indicated by both Russell N. SKOGSBERC who prepared Section I, and George T. HEMSLEY, who prepared Section III of the NOC Status Report, Subject is an impressive officer who has developed superb cover for himself but who has been only reasonably effective in identifying, developing and turning over useful access agents to the Station. While endorsing the general thrust of the Memorandum in Lieu of a Fitness Report, the undersigned also feels that Subject should bring a sharper focus to bear on developing in-depth relationships with those persons who have the potential of becoming quality access agents to priority targets. Subject meets and knows many people in his milieu, including Sovicts; he reports in considerable volume on these contacts. We encourage him to concentrate on a few of these contacts and to plumb them to their depths. The under- signed joins SKOGSBERG in wishing Subject well and in paying recognition to his motivation and his attitude.

Subject's Specific Duties remained essentially as described in his previous Fitness Report (for the period 1 January - 31 December 1973). I would rate him on these Specific Duties as he was previously rated.

# FITNESS REPORT - FIELD TRANSMITTAL

SPECIAL NOTE

Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section B. However, the nature, source, purpose or disposition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the description of specific duties of certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of specific duties will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.

INSTRUCTIONS

The following items of the Fitness Report will NOT be completed by field personnel.

SUBJECT : Inclusion of HHE shipment in contract for Independent Contractor, Thomas B. CASASIN (P)

1. It is requested that the new contract for Thomas B. CASASIN (P) include shipment of HHE for him and his dependents and POV as well as storage of household effects.

2. CASASIN retired from the Agency 28 June 1974, and by regulation is entitled to movement of HHE up to one year. An extension of an additional six months can be requested, but beyond that CASASIN would not be covered.

3. EUR has been granted approval to hire CASASIN under a Paris Station project. His cover job contract has been approved until May 1977, at which time he plans to return to the United States.

However, the nature, source, purpose or disposition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form.

The nature of the action could range from counseling, to further training, to placing on probation, to reassignment or to separation. Describe action taken or proposed in Section C.

M-Marginal Performance is deficient in some aspects. The reasons for assigning this rating should be stated in Section C and remedial actions taken or recommended should be described.

P-Proficient Performance is satisfactory. Desired results are being produced in the manner expected.

S-Strong Performance is characterised by exceptional proficiency.

O-Outstanding Performance is so exceptional in relation to requirements of the work and in comparison to the performance of others doing similar work as to warrant special recognition.

## SPECIFIC DUTIES

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness personnel, space, equipment and funds must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C attach a separate sheet of paper.

During the period covered by this report, subject began a new job in an upper level, executive capacity with an international organization. He obtained this job without BEHERALD assistance and the salary offsets approximately 40% of the total cost of this activity. This cover job was possible because of subject's extensive, solid background in scientific journalism and his French fluency. His cover is impeccable because he is capable of a first class, professional performance on this job and be was selected for the job solely on his professional qualifications in competition with other highly-qualified persons.

A solid cover situation is useful only to the extent that it serves as a base for BEHERALD activities. Despite a full time job and umitting superiors and co-workers, Subject has done a full time job for BKHERALD. He has maintained an intensive dialogue with one Soviet official, frequent contact with others, and he is developing additional Soviet contacts in his cover organization. He has also established initial contacts with Chinese officials and has laid the foundation, through the cover organization, to develop and maintain direct and long-term contact with certain of these targets. He has been effective and ingenious in devising direct access to this difficult target and to others having access.

Subject devotes about 50% of his operational effort to the Soviet and Chinese targets. His operational reporting reflects these priorities and it is timely.

3. COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

During the period under review, this NOC moved into a highly sensitive but potentially very valuable new cover situation, in which he has infinitely greater access to Soviet and Chinese targets. The NOC is also superbly equipped to handle this new position, by virtue of previous experience, linguistic competence and substantive knowledge of the field of endeavor. He should, in our judgment, do a first-class job, both for the cover employer, and for the Organization as well.

With respect to the specific duties set forth in the first section of this report, this reviewer would not have rated specific duty number two at the "0"

SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

complete and literate. Despite his relative isolation as a NOC, he is well aware of priority objectives, concentrates his efforts in these areas and does not waste time on operationally marginal activities.

As is normal in a NOC situation, subject has no supervisory duties with BKHERALD personnel but his cover job provides supervisory responsibility. Subject is meticulous in presentation of financial accountings and his operational expenses are modest. There are no administrative problems related to this project.

SECTION D (cont'd) REVIEWING OFFICIAL

level; in point of fact, it would, in the writer's opinion, merit a solid "S", but no more. Recognizing that such ratings are perforce subjective, and that the rating officer has a closer, almost daily experience factor, nonetheless, the reviewer simply does not believe that the written record of the NOC's accomplishments on the specific targets will support an "0" rating at this time. Even accepting the limitations which the cover situation imposes upon the NOC, henas still not performed in a manner which would correspond to the literal definition of "0".

Other than this divergency, the reviewer shares the laudatory comments set forth in the narrative on this NOC. He is all the things the rater has stated and more: highly intelligent, versatile, linguistically extremely well qualified, and professionally experienced in his cover role. He has begun very well to utilize this new cover position on the Organization's behalf, and it is quite accurate to note that the NOC landed this particular plum (in terms of competition for the cover vacancy) solely on the basis of his own demonstrated talents in the cover context.

In sum, this is an experienced, effective NOC, whose no cover affords him an expanded natural access to a host of the Station's primary targets; he has begun to exploit this access in a sound, logical fashion, and the period ahead should further document the utility of his key situation to our operational programs. In fairness to all concerned, it is simply too early in this new position to attempt a definitive judgment of the depth of access which can be derived from it.

Comments by Chief, EUR France:

Although concurring with an overall rating of "S", I consider the "0" ratings for specific duties numbers one and two to be somewhat high and I recommend an "S" for both. Casasin certainly has maintained his cover and we anticipate he will be able to preserve it in his new job. He has just begun to initiate contacts with Soviet personnel of operational interest and it remains to be seen how effectively Casasin can exploit this situation

NOCAD/MB REVIEWING OFFICER COMMENTS:

Whether Specific Duty No. 1 is rated "O" (as by the Station rater and reviewer) or "S" (as by the EUR Division reviewer), the fact remains that CASASIN is melding his overt life and operational activity against a primary Station target with a degree of success not often achieved by Agency officers.

CASASIN's response to requirements based in NOCAD administrative and managerial responsibilities has been prompt and efficient; in this additional specific duty we rate his performance "Strong".

In view of his initiative and competence in a demanding and sensitive NOC assignment, NOCAD agrees with CASASIN's overall performance rating of "Strong".

SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

During the period covered by this report, Subject has settled into his new cover job as an upper-level executive in an international organization. This salary offsets approximately 40% of the cost of maintaining this NOC in Paris. His cover is, however, excellent for other than financial reasons: Subject's experience and skills are such that he is admirably qualified to perform the job and is doing outstanding work in the eyes of his peers and supervisors, all of whom are unwitting. More importantly, it places him in a situation where he has normal, daily contact with numerous Soviet officials and by skillful use of his cover job he concocts logical reasons for contacting Chinese officials to whom he does not have natural access. In additim to direct contact to target individuals,. Subject uses his position to spot and assess co-workers having access to Station targets.

The area of Subject's performance most in need of strengthening is follow-up development of operational targets. His cover situation is somewhat unique for an NOC in that it puts him in daily contact with his priority target group: Soviet officials and other potential agents having direct access to Soviet officials. This access is not fully exploited. He should make a concerted effort to expand social and/or business contacts with the four or five Soviet officials who work in close proximity to him and to seek out and assess eight or ten third

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur with the supervisor's letter ratings and with the substance of his narrative comments. Put as simply as possible, Subject has done an outstanding job in establishing superb access cover; it now remains for him and the Station to exploit it operationally. On the basis of his ability during the reporting period to establish meaningful relationships with target Soviets or to spot and assess leads to potential agents who can, Subject's retention is this assignment would not be justified in terms of costs. The 40% rebate does make this effort entirely defensible, however, but Subject should understand that we expect more concrete results now that his cover position has been solidified.

country nationals who work in the same offices as these Soviet officials. The objective is more first hand reporting by Subject on Soviet officials and assessment reports on several of his co-workers who can be selected and recruited (based on his assessment reports) by other case officers to serve as access agents to Soviet officials.

Despite long service as an NOC, Subject's knowledge of and responsiveness to Organization priorities and requirements has not weakened. He concentrates on priority targets and his operational reporting is complete, on target and highly literate.

As is normal in an NOC position, Subject has no supervisory duties ever Organization personnel although his cover job does include supervisory responsibilities. Subject is meticulous in his presentation of financial accountings and his operational expenses are modest. There are no administrative problems related to this project.

FITNESS REPORT - FIELD TRANSMITTAL

SPECIAL NOTE:

Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section B. However, the nature, source, purpose or disposition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the description of specific duties of certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of specific duties will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action.

If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

During the period covered by this report subject's job with a scientific publication was terminated for economy reasons. He has now, by his own efforts and with no BKTRUST help, obtained a similar position (as of mid-March the contract has not been signed but it is almost certain that he has the job) with an international organization. The job is at a professional level with a salary that will offset approximately 40% of the total cost of this activity. His French fluency and background in scientific journalism were instrumental in obtaining this job. Subject's operational security is good and all indications are that his cover security is superb.

Despite a full time cover job, and completely unwitting employer, subject has maintained a high output for BKTRUST. He has maintained frequent and meaningful contact with two MHHARSH nationals in Paris and with an MHHARSH couple in another European city. The flow of spotting reports is equal in number and quality to those produced when his cover work was less demanding. One person spotted and assessed by subject was successfully recruited by an "inside" case officer. Subject's cover situation precludes the possibility of his recruiting.

SECTION C. NARRATIVE (continued)

It has been noted in past fitness reports that subject was weak in long-range, operational development of a target. The ease and probable success of an extended development is a function of the personalities involved. During this reporting period subject has conducted a sustained development of an MHHARSHER despite their different ages and divergent personalities thus demonstrating improvement in this area.

It some times appears that subject's reporting could be more preciso and more closely attuned to BKTRUST objectives. This is probably the result of time limitations, and the NOC officer's knowledge of BKTRUST needs is lessened by his relative isolation.

As is normal in a NOC situation, subject has no supervisory duties with BKTRUST personnel. His cover job provided supervisory responsibility. Subject is meticulous in presentation of financial accountings and his operational expenses are modest.

Section 3 Comments by Reviewing Official

The career of this NOC officer has reached a crucial juncture; if, as we currently anticipate, he succeeds in landing the position for which he appears to have the inside track, he will gain access to an institution and its employees which could prove to be invaluable. His new function will permit the widest possible access to a variety of targets, and with careful guidance, his utility as a spotter and assessor should improve very substantially.

The report notes that this officer has conducted a lengthy dialogue with an MHHARSH target; it is quite accurate that our NOC has handled himself well in a situation where disparity in age and background renders the relationship somewhat incongruous. Nonetheless, accuracy requires that we record that the NOC's interlocutor has obviously not maintained this ongoing relationship solely for altruistic motives, and has, in point of fact, on one occasion suggested that the NOC night wish to "help" hia in the preparation of restricted distribution reports on the local situation, even though the particular topic was in itself totally innocuous. For these reasons we continue to monitor this relationship with great care, particularly since we simply cannot assess its longer range viability and the direction it is likely to take.

In sum, the NOC has done the best he could under somewhat trying circumstances, exacerbated by the severe economic problems of his erstwhile employer, which led to the NOC's being separated from that position at the end of last year. Through his own efforts, the NOC learned of the vacancy for which he has applied, and by assiduous and discriminating manipulation of his extensive connections on the local scene, has managed to maneuver himself into becoming the leading candidate for the post. If he is accepted for this position, his value to the Organization will unquestionably increase by a quantum leap, and we are consequently optimistic concerning his future ability to make an impressive contribution to Organizational goals on the local scene.

Mr. Thomas B. Casasin

Dear Mr. Casasin:

The United States Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer, hereby contracts with you as an Independent Contractor to render professional services of a confidential nature under the following terms and conditions:

1. Fee. For professional services rendered hereunder, you will be paid a fee calculated at the rate of $8,000 per annum. Payments will be made as requested by you in writing in a manner acceptable to the Government.

2. Taxes. As an Independent Contractor, monies paid you under paragraph one (1) above constitute taxable income for Federal tax purposes and you must satisfy your Federal tax liability thereon. Such income may be paid you by or through a cover facility. Because of cover, operational and security considerations, the Tax Board or this organization is authorized to make certain determinations and establish procedures (including tax withholdings) which will result in the full satisfaction of your Federal income and Social Security tax obligations. It is specifically understood and agreed that such determinations and procedures, whether oral or written, constitute an integral part of this contract and are legally incorporated herein by reference.

3. Travel. You will be advanced or reimbursed funds for travel and transportation expenses for you and your dependents to and from your permanent post of assignment and for you alone for authorized operational travel. In addition, you will be entitled to storage of such household and personal effects as are not shipped in conformance with applicable organization policies and procedures. You may be entitled to per diem in lieu of subsistence in the course of all travel performed hereunder and when authorized for you alone while on temporary duty away from your permanent post of assignment. Upon your satisfactory completion of services hereunder, you will be authorized transportation expenses for you, your dependents and your household and personal effects to your recorded permanent place of legal residence in the United States. All travel, transportation and per diem provided for under this paragraph must be properly authorized and expenses incurred herewith are subject to payment and accounting in substantial compliance with Government regulations or your cover facility, whichever is directed by the Government.

4. Operational Expenses. You will be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary operational expenses including, but not limited to, entertainment and the purchase of information, as specifically approved by the Government.

During the period under review, Subject managed to gain full-time employment as a senior executive of an HBSPRITE government subsidized scientific publication at a time of economic slowdown when jobs were not easy to get. He did this without help from Headquarters or the station. Such an achievement is a tribute to Subject's fluency in French, his ability to write, his general scientific know-how and his good buisness sanse. Over half of his salary therefore is now paid by this company. In converting to full-time employment, a major ad- justment, Subject's contribution to the station operations in the MHHARSH and TPFAST fields against which he is targetted temporarily decroased somewhat, subject continued, however, to maintain contact with three local MHHARSH officials and initiated contact with three others. He also continued to search for new leads to personalities in the priority aroas assigned to him. Subject has the capability to call on local scientists or technicians of just about any nationality with the possiblo exception of TPPAST citizens. He has used this near- unique potential well.

Subject has had occasional difficulty switching from "professional" or intellectual subjects in his development of MHHARSH personalities or access prospects to more down-to-earth interests necessary --con't--

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

The Station submitted comments on subject officer recently in OF7T- 16549 (8 April 1971), to which we should add that Subject has, largely on his own merits, acquired a solid and potentially highly useful cover employment, However, this new employment will demand a very substantial amount of time and energy from Subject, and the unanswer- able question at the moment relates to his availability for Organiza- tional tasks. We shall need additional time and careful working with this officer to determine the answer, since the fiscal outlay from the Organization to support his continued stay in Paris is still quite

to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore more in the field of spotting and making oporational contacts than in that of more than short-range operational development. Subject's operational situation makes it impossible for him to attempt recruitments. Thus, his very real achievements are not by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to be copious. He could, however, further improve the selectivity of the leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to "digest" the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function, he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He is careful with operational expenses and has exercised good security.

During the period under review, additional efforts have been made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him further in the work of the station component with which he works. He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

Section D (continued)

substantial. In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know, although our initial inpressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred an "8" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately deserve an "0", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.. Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have been in the higher range of the "P" category, rather than "s", but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer, who is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a frequent basis.

In sum, the cover is superb, and only time will reveal to what extent the cover requirements permit a full measure on be-half of the Organization. We are following this aspect closely and will be commenting upon it subsequently as we gain experience and knowledge.

The comments of the rating officer are limited to the period from October 1969 to March 1970 during which he worked with Subject. The previous rating officer has added his comments to allow coverage of the total indicated period from April 1962 to March 1970. During this period Subject was integrated in a new team assigned to the local S&T and Commercial [REDACTED] target. Subject's recent activity has been very productive indeed. Subject used the excellent potential given to him by his cover to skillfully spot and assess access agent candidates. As Subject's operational situation in Paris precludes making recruitment, the most promising of these candidates was placed in contact with a Station officer during social events Subject organized. At the same time, Subject continued his efforts to develop personal relationship with several [REDACTED] The beginning of personal, as opposed to purely professional, relations with a major [REDACTED] target enabled him to obtain insight into the target's beliefs and personality which was the best the Station had to date. Subject also managed to establish contact with two other [REDACTED] representatives of interest. This, in one case, required almost six months to accomplish via a combination of patience, skill and determination. Subject is an experienced officer. He is also cart conscious and practices good security. The Station has no other agent with the necessary scientific and editorial know-how, fluent French and local knowledge to replace Subject. In view of this and the recent progress made by Subject in response to very specific requirements and his willingness to try to establish personal and, hopefully, social relations with access prospects and [REDACTED] targets, the Station recently recommended that he be extended in Paris. At the same time, the Station recommended that Subject's cover be reinforced by full-time employment with

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

As previous Station correspondence and fitness reports will reflect, this officer has been the subject of varying evaluations and projections in recent years. In fairness to him, however, it is equally true that an officer under non-official cover reflects, in the level and quality of his performance, the amount and type of influence, direction and push he receives from the responsible inside case officer. Making allowances for these variables, this officer's past record has not been impressive; however, it is also correct to note that he has improved substantially during the latter part of the period under review, and that if the Station can work out some fiscal arrangement which will reduce the heavy financial input.

Section D3 continued

from the Organization, his continued presence at this Station definitely appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat longer period than that reflected by this report.

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more aggressive efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity to the primary Station targets. This officer does bring many talents to bear on his operational activity: he has absolutely Quent French, a solid and exploitable cover, and a vast range of contacts in the local community. Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts In depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue them actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina- tion from further development, for whatever reason.

In sum, in spite of the recognised and commmendable improvement in this officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would more properly have been a "P", and that the overall rating, at this point, would more accurately be set at a leval between "P" and "S", probably closer to the former than the latter.

This reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared the Fitness Report.

During this reporting period subject had very markedly increased the tempo of his activities and contacts. Many agent prospects have been screened and contacts were established with people of interest to several elements of the Station. Subject is particularly thorough and outstanding on specific investigations where he utilized cover in a skillful and imaginative way. He has improved in terms of people development but in this respect he is still best with people in a professionally related context rather than a contrived social context. As mentioned in the previous report subject's cover assignment does not allow him to make recruitments. Subject has a high degree of cost consciousness and does not exercise any supervisory responsibilities.

I do not concur in this rating. I would have given the employee STRONG in the performance of his cover responsibilities, that is to say in the manner in which he has created and expanded his cover. I would have restricted myself to PROFICIENT, however, in assessing his exploitation of that cover for operational purposes. For a fuller treatment of this staff agent's performance, suggest that reference be made to the BOC Status Report, submitted 26 May 1969, via OFPA-89925.

Since the last reporting period Subject's efforts were directed by the station toward the spotting, developing and assessing WOLADY S&T agent candidates in terms of recruitment and inclusion in the Station's S&T spotting network.

Subject has done thorough and at times imaginative spade work in this field despite the fact that the mission was not as successful as anticipated. Recent progress however would indicate that the next reporting period would be more productive.

Subject continues to respond to ad-hoc specific assignments in an exemplary manner.

Because of the nature of his cover assignment Subject is not authorized to make recruitments.

Subject has a high degree of cost consciousness. He does not exercise any supervisory responsibilities under his cover assignment.

3. It is difficult to place in the proper perspective the contribution of this senior staff agent to Paris Station operations. On the one hand, Subject has established superb cover in the scientific and technical field which should have afforded him virtually unlimited access to persons of interest to us, both Soviet and potential access agents. In evaluating the manner in which the employee set up and managed this cover, I would tend to agree with his comments to the fitness report on the demands on him although these comments are somewhat overdrawn.

The principal difficulty has been the time it has taken to relate the cover potential to the specific operational requirements of the Station. We have not received from CASASIN as leads and assessment reports to persons of operational interest in the s&f field as we think he could have produced. It may be that the earlier listing of the project (viewed as a regional undertaking) contributed to this.

Recently we have noted significant improvement in that we have received responses to requests we have made for assessment and development of potential access agents within a cover context. We hope, therefore, that this last year of CASASIN's stay will be the most productive ever. It is unfortunate that the cover must end because of the cover company's decisions over which we had no control.

ADDENDLY, Form 45 (Fitness Report), for period March 67-March 63.

## Section D

As the individual being rated, I would like to add some remarks to those prepared by the rating officer.

The assignment I have includes managerial responsibilities which (a) are essential to the continued existence and security of the cover mechanism as a vehicle for operational exploitation, and (b) are not necessarily visible to those "on the insido."

In the case of (a), I must engage in a constant orchestration of the cover and the facilities it offers. This means maintaining a managerial equilibrium to insure that cover work will not beecme, of itself, so deranding that it negates the cover's utility to the CS. Caerfect, the top officers and riddle managers of the cover corporation (who are not cleared and wisting) have to be satisfied that their demands are met (or cannot be), or else manipulated in order to neutralize or reject their demands. After all, the cover position is to them a legitimate, normal, workaday post in their firm. What work is done at their bidding, it follows, must be accomplished according to the high standards of thoroughness and accuracy which they have set.

In the case of (b) -- which derives from (a) -- and can prove to be so demanding that the needs of the CS could no longer be served, the incumbent is required to manage a span of human contacts at several levels in order to preserve his cover position and enhance its value to the CS. This means planning, directing and managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of technical correspondents, as well as meetings and negotiations to improve the (cover firm's) relations with similarly widespread individuals at the levels of editor-in-chief, publisher, corporate vice-president, president, and chairman of the board. These levels are scattered not only throw industry, bus have their analogs as well in government, higher education, and professional societies.

Having previously managed both a CS base and the principal denied-areas operating component of a major field Station, I can report quite honestly that my present managerial responsibilities exceed the former -- despite the apparent lack of "supervisory responsibilities" in my present position.

Subject continues to maintain a secure effective cover mechanism. In this reporting period the whole thrust and objectives of this cover facility have been changed from pursuit of targets designated by Headquarters at international conferences to pursuit of the local Soviet presence. This has caused a major readjustment and Subject is now beginning to produce the type of leads that help the Station achieve its local operational objectives.

Subject continues to show a well organised methodical approach to his cover and operational tasks.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I rarely see the written product of this employee's efforts and know little of his work except as I am informed of it by his superviser in the Station. I have the impression, however, that the employee is responding to his supervisor's guidance and is not by any means simply drifting along paths indicated by his cover work, which can be a temptation when an employee has, as is true in this case, rather limited contact with his colleagues who work under official cover on the same target. I thus concur in the evaluation on the basis of limited knowledge.

## SECTION C NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable. During the reporting period this employee as a staff agent has continued the solidification of his cover and the expansion of his operational activity within his cover to a point where he represents as deeply buried a staff officer as can be found in anyone with his past organizational background. From the point of view of the host country authorities he appears to be completely legitimate. From the more important point of view of his targets, he also apparently has, been accepted, and not through a lack of opportunity for scrutiny, for what he claims to be. He thus represents for KUBARK an asset who has not only solid status and access cover, but also the demonstrated capability for exploiting his cover for specific and aggressive operational undertakinge.

As has been stated in past fitness reports, his present capability directly and openly to approach operational targets through the vehicle of his cover is the result of his own efforts, in which he has devoted a tremendous amount of work not only to establish and enhance the foundations of the cover, which requires a considerable amount of work for the cover company, but to devise and exploit ways and reans by which the cover activity may be applied directly to operational tasks and programs. In addition to operational activity in his country of assignment, he has also been used in Hqs-directed activity in other countries, usually involving direct contact with target individuals, and in addition he has contributed greatly to the acquisition of operational information for the use of Hqs components in their overall approach to Soviet scientific and technical targets.

It would be difficult to fault this employee with respect to energy, professional skills, and mental capacity. He is a keen student of his operational environment and very skillful in analyzing the possibilities it offers for application toward operational objectives. He shows considerable resourcefullness in devising logical and credible (continued)

Since the Reviewing Officer in the field has not indicated his views on this Fitness Report, I would like to make a comment of my own. Without vishing to detract from anything the Supervisor has said about Subject's performance, I feel obliged to note that the ratings given him in this report are higher than those given, for example, to any Branch Chief in this Division, and, as such, are inconsistent with the grading pattern of the Division as a whole.

approaches to operational problems and personalities, and expends considerable effort in maintaining a level of specialized Knowledge sufficient to backstop his cover and to ensure the maximum exploitation of his contacts with target organizations and individuals. His command of spoken, written, and technical French të excellent.

From the point of view of supervision, this employee in his present position requires guidance only insofar as to identify specific targets and for him to protect himself in situations where he does not have, by virtue of his not having access to official files, specialized information. Otherwise, he requires no supervision other than the periodic provision of policy and operational directives.

This employee has always been conscious and punctillious in his preparation of operational and administrative reports, including financial accountings, and his reporting in general, despite the burdens imposed by the necessity for minimizing the risks inherent in the lack of access to classified storage, leaves nothing to be desired.

Other than the funds for operational activities, this employee currently has no responsibility for the programming and use of personnel, space, equipment, and futa.

wita res, not be dedication to his job, this exployee has praccally speaking single-handedly built his present cover/operational position despite a number of negative factors innerent to his situation such as relative isolation, meager opportunity for contact with his professional group, and expensive area of assignment, and an exposed cover situation where the necessity for living cover is compounded by the necessity of avoiding mistakes which might jeopardize cover. His dedication to and enthusiasm for accepting the challenge ofthis assignment, and his willingness to continue on in it, deserve particular mention, particularly since he would perhaps Justifiably feel that his present assignment may leave him outside the mainstream of competitive organisation progression..

This employee's health and family situations leave nothing to be desired, as his proven mobility in the execution of operational assignments attests.

It should further be noted that with respect to the problem endeaic to deep-cover assignments of allocation of time between cover work and operational activity, this employee comes very close to the happy norm of making cover work complement operational work, and making operational work contribute where possible to the enhancement of cover.

While this employee's assignment to date has essentially been a one-san show, it 13 roscerended that serious consideration be given to expanding the operational 331 plex which he has created in order to capitalize on his expertenerk he has put in to date, and his own management capabilities.

*(Section 31 No special recognition of Subject's "Outstanding" overall performance is being requested at this time.

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for Improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section 8 to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

This employee combines the relatively rare combination of a senior and broadly experienced intelligence officer uder working cover providing both long-ters status in his country of residence (and in Europe in general) and access for a variety of operational functions, including spotting, assessing, contact with Soviet bloa nationals of specific interest, Investigative measures, assessment in depth of ostensibly cover-company hired persons, and attendance at a broad range of national and international specialized meetings. Development of the capability operationally to exploit his cover has been the achievement of the employee himself. In no doing he has at the same time achieved genuine acceptance by his cover company associates (most of whom are unwitting) and his colleagues in his cover profession and related professions.

In undertaking operational tasks tals employme has consistently shom, Liftlacive imagination, security consciousness, and application of bol. operational and substan- tive background to the problem at hand. He has put a conscious effort into improving his already excellent command of the French language, and his grasp of a variety of specialized scientific and technical fields has been achieved basically as a result of his own efforts.

His management of operational reporting, finances, and the administrative problems connected with his cover status has been exemplary...

It should be noted that during the reporting period, this employee has not had the benefit at all times of specific pinpointed operational direction. As of the end of the reporting period, Headquarters assumed control of his activities against specific Soviet targets ona Europe-kida basis.

I would like to expand the operating base provided by the cover organization by taking on several journeymen case officers to work with me against both denied area and host country targets, and to make the cover facility and the access it provides of more versatile use to both the station and to KUDOVE as a whole.

My second choice would be to return to HQ, and use the knowledge and experience I have gained in my present job to (1) select staff personnel who will be placed in non-official cover, (2) select the cover mechanisms proper, (3) train our personnel for the proper discharge of their total responsibilities while serving under such cover (refer to catalog of courses, if available):

The completion of work toward a master's or doctor's degree in the physical or life sciences, or in the management/administration of the sciences and their personnel.

SECTION C

NARRATIVE COPPIENTS

The assignment of this employee to the field under non-official cover was designed to compensate for the loss of an employee in an official cover slot which was out from the Station's ODACID allotment of personnel positions.

During the reporting perfod this employee has accomplished with success the convincing establishment of his cover in a complex milieu, and has been accepted as legitimate by his professional colleagues, the persons whom hỗ meots under cover, and the French authorities. It should be noted that his ability to assume his cover has been largely the result of his own efforts over a period of years to acquire and maintain a familiarity with the general scientific field.

During the reporting period he has developed a wide circle of contacts in the scientific and journalistic fields and applies a long background in a variety of assignments in KUDOVE to the determination and assessment of operational potential among these contacts. At the same time his cover organization, in which only four persons are witting of his actual status, has shown itself to be more than satisfied with his performance of his cover duties.

This employes requires a minimum of detailed operational supervision; it is necessary in specifió cases only to indicate the operational or informational objectives.

From the point of view of administrative support, his attention to detail and meticulousness reduce the problems of his support by the Station to a minimum.

This employee uses the French language continuously, and his facility is such as to permit him to handle himself excellently in a broad range of complex technical subjects. He has in addition undertaken specialized French language training to develop this capability further. His operational reporting is excellent both with regard to clarity and pertinence.

In the immediate future he will be assigned case work, for the most part in fields where it will complement, and be complemented by, his in- dependent operational activities and cover work.

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Subject is an exceedingly well-equipped operations officer. He is mature, intelligent, has a thorough background in operations in his area and the ability to grow in his job. His operational planning and execution is usually impeccable. He has the loyalty of his subordinates and the respect of his equals and supervisors. He is particularly effective in dealing in the liaison field where his good sense and disinterest in "fighting the problem" produces a maximum of cooperation and good will.

DIRECTIONS: Stress strengths and weaknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Subject has excellent natural equipment for employment in this organization in terms of his intelligence and natural apptitudes. Additionally, he brings a great deal of area knowledge and language ability to his present assignment. During the period covered by this report he has displayed great industry and devotion to duty in a variety of circumstances and achieved notable results in production and in the creation of both short and long-term assets for his unit. On the debit side I would say that he is somewhat too businesslike in many personal situations to the point of being almost humourless. This, however, is a quality which he does not permit to intrude upon the necessities of his operational week although it often shows in office relationships.

SECTION D. SUITABILITY FOR CURRENT JOB IN ORGANIZATION

DIRECTIONS: Take into account here everything you know about the individual....productivity, conduct in the job, pertinent personal characteristics or habits, special defects or talents....and how he fits in with your team. Compare him with others doing similar work of about the same level.

1 - DEFINITELY UNSUITABLE - HE SHOULD BE SEPARATED

SECTION IV

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable or unfavorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The descriptive words are to be interpreted literally.

On the left hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in some degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks: this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left, then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Observed" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

The only remark/caveat that "more is the" and I stated in the previous report is that the administrative responsibilities of a branch chief do not enable him to be a purely operational individual. If it were possible to carry loss of an administrative load, I would enjoy devoting all of my time to the refinement of the intelligence process and its techniques in my area of concern.

During this period Mr. Richardson was promoted from deputy branch Chief to Branch Chief, in recognition of his extremely good performance. Not enough time has elapsed to be able to evaluate him fully on all aspects of his new position. However, his handling of the branch has been unusually good from a management point of view and there is every reason to believe that in the planning and direction of operational activities the same high standard will prevail.

9. IN WHAT TYPE OF WORK ARE YOU PRIMARILY INTERESTED?
   I am primarily interested in the conception, planning, and operational management of FI
   and PP activities your PRESENT JOB? YOUR QUALIFICATIONS (APTITUDE, KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS).
   This differs from my present assignment essentially in that a Branch Chief or his Deputy
   becomes so involved in administrative detail that he cannot always give his undivided
   attention to project management and agent handling problems. Otherwise, I feel that my
   background and experience qualify me for the functions I aspire to perform.

11. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THIS PERSON'S PERFORMANCE ON THE MAJOR DUTIES LISTED UNDER ITEM 7 ABOVE. As Deputy Branch
    Chief, Mr. Richardson has performed his duties, taken as a whole, in a superior manner.
    His timely and efficient preparation of intelligence annexes, logistic and fiscal require
    ments and reports has been particularly outstanding. During three to four months of the
    past year, Mr. Richardson has acted as Branch Chief. The review of Branch operations under
    Mr. Richardson's direction, during the writer's absence, indicated his complete competence
    in supervising Branch activities. His supervision of the planning and preparation for ap
    proval of basic plans and projects of the seven (7) desk chiefs has been superior. Mr.
    Richardson also participated in the planning and dispatch of a difficult operational mis
    sion, acting in the capacity of Senior Case Officer. On this mission his liaison with
    representatives of one of the Military Services was conducted in a manner which enhanced
    cooperation between that service and this Agency.

SECURITY INFORMATION

12. IN OMAT RESPECT IS THIS PERSON'S PERFORMANCE ON PRESENT JOB MOST NOTICEABLY GOOD OR OUTSTANDING!

Mr. Richardsonto performance was noticeably outstanding with respect to his thorough knowledge of overy activity of the Branch. He was in position to assume direction of Branch activities at any time. He also kept himself thoroughly briefed on Division policies and planning in order to give timely instruction and guidance to the Branch overseas stations.

13. ON WHAT ASPECT OF PERFORMANCE SHOULD THIS PERSON CONCENTRATE EFFORT, FOR SELF EMPROVEMENTT..

Mr. Richardson has a very thorough background in two (2) languages, French and Japanese. Ho pwould benefit substantially by learning the Russian Languago. He is meticulons with respect to his attention to details, sometimes to the point of concealing the broader picture from his view. It would bo well for Mr. Pichardson to direct his attention to the broad scope of Branch activities rather than to concentrate on its details.

14. COMMENT ON THIS PERSON'S ABILITY TO MANDLE GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

Mr. Richardson is fully qualified to assume the duties of the chief St. Division representative at a field station. In order to assume this responsibility in the most efficient manner, it is recommended that Mr. Richardson serve a minimum period of time of approximate ly six (6) months as the assistant to the present chief of the flold station.

15. ARE THERE OTHER DUTIES WHICH BETTER SUIT THIS PERSON'S QUALIFICATIONS? (Recommend appropriate reassignment, if possible.1

Mr. Richardson could serve effectively in a staff function for either Fl or PP activities. This does not mean, however, that his prosent duties are not better suited to his qualifications.

16. WHAT TRAINING OR ROTATION DO YOU RECOMMEND FOR THIS PERSON?

Mr. Richardson has already been recommended for overseas assignment in the Far East during the past year. He has area knowledge and command of the Japanese language, having served in Japan previously with the United States Army. His duties at Headquaters nave been so pressing that his departure for overseas assignment is being delayed until an adequate replacement ray be trained.

Office


COURSE OBJECTIVES - CONTENT AND METHODS - Instructor: W. Ray Reckley

This is the second phase in a three-phase basic sequence of 30 weeks, each phase lasting 10 weeks.

The general aim of this course is to provide a thorough grounding for the student who has previously had either a reading course in French or an insufficient introduction to the language. The major objectives of this phase of the course are to develop an ability: (1) to distinguish and pronounce satisfactorily all the sounds of the language; (2) to use effectively a modest stock of French sentences and expressions; (3) to comprehend normal speed spoken French in a variety of everyday non-technical situations; (4) to begin to read and write basic French, applying the spoken vocabulary and grammatical material previously learned.

Classes are held 2 hours per day, 5 days a week, requiring a minimum of 10 hours of preparation per week. To receive the maximum benefit from this course each student should plan to devote at least two-thirds of the class preparation time doing drill in the language laboratory.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

Student progress is evaluated primarily on oral recitation in the form of drills and free conversation based on memorized material. In addition, several tests are given during the course. This student's rating is indicated by the asterisk.

| Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory | Excellent | Incomplete |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- |
|                |              | 3         | 10         |

Mrs. Richardson was definitely a superior student. Her pronunciation was excellent and she had a solid command of the structure of French. She was somewhat hesitant in new language situations, but she more than made up for this through diligent and profitable laboratory and home preparation.

3. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM (Include list of courses and a copy of grades received)

Technical Writers' Institute; certificate awarded

Purpose: to provide a forum where technical writers from industry and government can meet to discuss and practice writing techniques under the supervision of experienced teachers. Many of the instructors have worked closely with industry as consultants on special writing problems and training courses for technical writing. All of them have published in the field of technical writing.

4. YOUR OPINION OF THE PROGRAM (Explain strengths and weaknesses)

This was an excellent combination of classroom presentations and writing laboratories. Almost all guest speakers had a useful message to deliver. The writing encouraged is of the tight-language, pure English variety, in the three categories of informative, directive, and persuasive writing. The schedule was full, although I believe it could have been fuller. The five 2-hour workshops should be expanded to three-hour sessions. The contact with representatives of industry was especially useful for cross-fertilization purposes.

5. EXPLAIN TRAINING OBJECTIVES AND WHETHER THEY WERE MET

For our purposes, the training objectives were (a) to see that our writing techniques in the reporting field compare favorably with those in industry, (b) to meet and become known by persons throughout the nation in the technical writing field, and (c) to learn new techniques in the field of communicating technical, scientific and engineering concepts, processes, and general information. All three objectives were met. I recommend that officers from SR/Reports and SR/ Requirements-Targets, as well as analysts from SR 6, be permitted the opportunity to attend this same institute in future years. It is well worth the effort.

6. I CERTIFY THAT I ATTENDED THE TRAINING PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE.

MANAGEMENT COURSE NO. 64

40 hours, part-time 18 students

Student: Jacques Richardson Year of birth: 1924

EOD Date: September 1956 Grade: 14 Office: SR

COURSE OBJECTIVES - CONTENT AND METHODS

The Management Course is designed to familiarize senior line and staff managers with both the theory and the practical problems of managerment in CIA. The underlying assumption of the course is that management development is a process of growth on the jch. The course, however, enables the participants to examine their job activities in an environment where, guided by the instructors, they can critically examine their own actions, exchange ideas with managers from other components, and develop an understanding of the complex relationships that exist among the people, the pattern of organization, and the purposes of the Agency. The course approaches the problems of management in the Agency by discussing the formal and informal structures, concepts of leadership and communication, the problems of personnel management, and theories of planning and controlling. These subjects are related as closely as possible to the activities of the class members.

The content of the course is developed through lectures, case and group discussions, filmed presentations, and problem-solving exercises.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only. No attempt was made to evaluate student achievement in this course.

Student: Jacques G. Richardson Year of birth: 1924

EOD Date: November 1949 Grade: GS-14 Office: DDP/SR/6

## COURSE OBJECTIVES - CONTENT AND METHOD

This course aims to develop in the Clandestine Services officers, and others, recently returned from the field an up-to-date awareness of the role of CIA in the United States intelligence community, the relations of the ID/I area with the CB and the support available from the offices of the DD/S. Recently this course has been designated as an alternate pre- requisite for CIA officers nominated for certain external training.

The course is presented by lectures given by CIA officials who are directly responsible for the missions, functions, programs, and services discussed. Each lecture is usually followed by a short question period. Approximately 10 per cent of the students' time is scheduled for reading pertinent up-to-date regulations and background summaries.

## ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance only; no attempt was made to evaluate student achievement in the course. This student was conscientious and regular in attendance.

Projected Assignment or Present Position

The Counterespionage Course is a specialized course of three weeks’ duration designed to expose the student to CS principles and practices and to indoctrinate him therein. The course is conducted on a seminar, round-table basis. Emphasis is placed on student participation during staff and guest lectures. Ample time is allotted for reading the extensive material provided.

Each student is required, starting mid-way in the second week, to give a presentation before the class. This hour-long presentation is based on a problem assignment given the student by the staff. Exception is made where students have the field or headquarters experience in CE or a related field; such a student is permitted to give a one-hour lecture based on specific experience. The "canned" problems are selected to test students' ability to do CE research, collate, make logical analyses, and present ideas effectively to a seminar group.

This evaluation is based primarily on the student presentation, and to a lesser degree on participation in seminar discussions when conducted by the staff.

RICHARDSON, Jacques G

1. Mr. Richardson ranked first in a strong group. He applied himself effectively throughout the course. His sesinar contributions aided materially. He drew freely on a sound operational background and was by all odds the top student.

2. Student Presentation: Mr. Richardson presented a case with which he was familiar from his own experience. It was a first-rate performance. The material was very well organized and crisply pro- sented. So effective in fact, that Mr. Richardson will be called upon to give the same discussion in subsequent CE courses.

3. In my opinion Mr. Richardson is fully qualified to act as senior CE officer.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief, European Division

INFO:

FROM: Chief of Station, Paris

CLASSIFICATION: SECRET

SUBJECT: Admin/Personnel/Medical

ACTION REQUIRED: Dependents of Thomas B. CASASIN. Staff Agent

REFERENCE: OFPS-10932

CASASIN's dependents took physical examinations at the American Hospital in Paris on 20 February. Since, because of his cover there could be no LNHARP connection, CASASIN's dependents made arrangements for their physicals as private citizens, on the pretense that they required statements that they were in good health in order to obtain insurance. Obviously, forms 88 were not prepared; the attached certificates of good health and freedom from contagious disease are all that is normally given to private individuals in France. We hope they suffice.

Dependents of Thomas B. CASASIN

The Office of Medical Services has advised that Thomas B. CASASIN's dependents did not take physical examinations prior to their PCS return to Paris. So that CASASIN's dependents may be fully covered under the Overseas Medical Program, it is essential that arrangements be made for their physicals to be taken in the field and the results forwarded to Headquarters as soon as possible.

Fitness Report, 10 April 1958 - 31 March 1959 "Subject continues as one of the most capable, professional and hard working of the branch chiefs in the station. Working against a tough denied area problem, he demonstrates imagination, drive, excellent area background and know-ledge, and a high degree of productivity. Ho definitely has the potential for an even more responsible position." Fitness Report, 1 April 1959 - 24 June 1960 "In most respects, this officer is one of the best I have known in this agency. He has a broad and deep knowledge of his target area, as well as of his 'host country'; an excellent and proven degree of operational 'know-how'; the ability to write and speak lucidly and effectively and with apparent ease; and a very high degree of motivation and devotion to duty." Fitness Report, July 1960 - October 1961 "Subject supervises a very large and key branch engaged in a wide variety of activities, a difficult job which he does well."

Although it is mt essential, it would be desirable if the employee's cover permitted him to initiate and maintain contacts in the scientific, technological, commercial and engineering fields.

(5) Income directly attributable to cover should be in the range of $10,000 per annua, with supplementary income attributable to commissions, retainers, piece work fees, personal resources, etc.

(6) Employee should be able to devote upward of 30 hours per week to operational duties.

(7) Communications channels desired

Communications will be (a) directly with Station; (b) indirectly with Station via dead-drop, S/H, accommodation addresses, cut-outs, or any combination of these, or (c) In unusual circumstances via Headquarters or third country points. It is not desired that the cover facility provide an operational communication channel.

(8) Cover Suggestions

Suitable covers might includes technical publication representative, correspondent, or editors book or manuscript agent or publisher's representative; corporation, service, or management consultant's representatives prestige or representational agent for large firm, service, institute, or association. The cover vis-a-vis the target is less important than the status afforded by the cover to the eyes of the host government, l.e., a reason for being there.

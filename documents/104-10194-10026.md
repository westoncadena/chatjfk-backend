Mr. David A. Phillips
8224 Stone Trail Drive
Bethesda, Maryland 20034

Dear Dave:

The ordinary retirement letter is in no way appropriate for you. In the first place, your retirement is no stepping out of the active world into a world of pleasure. Instead, you are launching off on even a tougher challenge because of your sense of dedication. Your retirement also will not be the termination of your interest in intelligence and in this Agency. Instead, you are going to be doing what you can to help it survive the current set of attacks upon it. But most of all, your retirement is the departure of one of our most exceptional officers, to whom I had the great pleasure to give the Distinguished Intelligence Medal and whose work I have admired these many years. The only thing ordinary about your retirement is the sincere and special personal and official good wishes we in the Agency send to you and your family for success and satisfaction in the years ahead. This we send to all our retirees, and we send it to you with special spirit.

Sincerely,

W. E. Colby
Director

COS, Rio de Janeiro is a GS-17 position.

Mr. Phillips' current assignment as Chief, Cuban Operations Group plus previous overseas tours in WH Div. including a tour as Chief of Static, Santo Domingo, qualify him for the proposed assignment as Chief of Station, Rio de Janeiro.

He will enter Portuguese language training this fall which should provide adequate exposure to make the transition from Spanish which he speaks with native fluency.

Mr. Phillips has been highly effective as a senior member of WH Div., both at Headquarters and in the field. His relations with his co-workers and subordinates have always been excellent and his liaison with State Department representatives has been marked by good will and mutual respect.

NOTE: Above statement prepared by WH Division.

Mr. Galagen has been recalled from the Station. The DCOS Mr. Stewart D. Marten, GS-15, will serve as Acting COS until the arrival of Mr. Phillips in January 1970.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, Clandestine Services
Career Service Board

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Promotion to
GS-16: David A. Phillips

1. Mr. David A. Phillips is strongly recommended for promotion to GS-16 and is ranked Number 2 in WH Division's preference for promotion in that grade.

2. Mr. Phillips stands out among his peers as a true Clandestine Services operator. He has had a range of opera- tional assignments enjoyed by few Clandestine Services officers. He served in Cuba, Guatemala, Beirut, Chile, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. His functional assignments have included Contract Agent, Operations Officer under both unofficial and official cover, Chief of Station, and he is currently assigned as Chief, Cuban Operations Group. In regard to his tour as Chief of Station, Santo Domingo, I cite the following quote made by Dr. Hector Garcia-Godoy, Provisional President of the Dominican Republic, concerning the turbulent events in his country during his tenure:

"You know," he said, "looking back over those months when things seemed pretty bleak, two names come immediately to mind as able and effective representatives of the United States. They are Ellsworth Bunker and David Phillips."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

3. Mr. Phillips has the intelligence, language capability, personality, management and operational ability to move forward steadily in this Agency and he is now ready for promotion to GS-16. I urge you to act affirmatively on this promotion recommendation.

Dear Dave:

I thought you would be pleased about a reference to you which came up in the course of a longish conversation last night with Dr. Hector Garcia-Godoy, former President of the Dominican Republic and now Ambassador here, about the turbulent events in his country three years ago.

"You know," he said, "looking back over those months when things seemed pretty bleak, two names come immediately to mind as able and effective representatives of the United States. They are Ellsworth Bunker and David Phillips."

I thought such a pleasant echo of a rough period would help heal your ulcers.

Cordially,

MEMORANDUM FOR: David A. Phillips

THROUGH:

SUBJECT: Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization Retirement and Disability System

REFERENCE: Book Dispatch 5096 dated 12 August 1965

1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement and Disability System and have been so designated effective 23 October 1966.

2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons, the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed. Any questions that you may have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.

3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the policy decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retirement, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System. Thus, you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

THROUGH : Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT : Commendation

1. The Dominican Republic Station has distinguished itself by especially meritorious service during the past year and has made a major contribution toward the advancement of the objectives of the United States Government in a critical situation. One year ago the people of the Dominican Republic were facing a dismal future. Today, while the future remains uncertain, the prospects for eventual stability have been immeasurably increased. Several Departments and Agencies of the United States Government engaged in an effort to bring this about. I believe that the role of the CIA in the Dominican Republic during the past year was a crucial one. The highly effective performance of the Santo Domingo Station and the Base at Santiago was the result of the combined efforts of each officer and employee stationed there. These men and women gave unsparingly of their time, energy and brain power. Their efforts were sustained over a long period under stressful circumstances. Now, while our long-term mission continues, a significant milestone has been reached and it is most appropriate at this time to grant this special recognition for a job well done to all members of the CIA team in the Dominican Republic during the year ending June 30, 1966.

2. I should like to commend each member of the Station who contributed to this noteworthy performance and request that a copy of this commendation be placed in individual personnel files as appropriate.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20505

TO : David A. Phillips

SUBJECT: TDY in the Dominican Republic

Most of you who went down to the Dominican Republic departed with so much speed and so little ceremony that there was no time to explain the importance and urgency of your assignments. Now that you have served there during the crisis, the importance of the task needs no embellishment from us, but you should know that the con- tribution of the augmented Station was decisive in shaping the policies and actions of the government and in avoiding several majör mistakes. For weeks after the April revolu- tion, our Station reporting was literally the only source of information that the United States had on the role of Communism among the rebel forces and on conditions outside the capital.

Many fine things were done in the Station and in the hinterland by all of you. Manning the check-points under fire, flying to remote and hostile villages, moving tons of supplies through the gauntlet of the communications line, toiling over midnight reports, and keeping open our country's only commo link -- all these things were common- place. The dedication, discipline, and routine of our personnel placed them in a class apart.

To the sense of pride and accomplishment you must already feel, I want to add the gratitude and admiration of the DDP and of the Agency.

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: David A. Phillips

29 June 1961

On 14 June 1961 the undersigned reviewed with Mr. David A. Phillips his career development prospecta for the next five year period. We agreed that the following represented a desirablo and fatriy firm goal in this respect:

a. In general his future training and field experience should placo sufficient stress on the Cl and Fl fields to avoid the career confinement of strict CA specialization.

b. fiis next assignment would be a normal field tour in Mexico City. Upon return from that assignment, he would receive up to six months training to be followed by an assignment to the CA Staff (or the organizational successor thereon. One of his primary undertakings in the CA Staff would be to develop what might beat be termed "ideological warfare" (o.g., a search for basic ideas and concepts with wide appeal) as opposed to the normal propagamla approach (e.g., a running debate on current evente).

It coincided with a period of unusually high stress and strain in the Western Hemisphere Division, particularly in relation-ships with the State Department and in the problems left over from our drastic manures designed to protect ourselves against a potential counterintoiligence disaster. Thנסה הt important fact to be recorded about Mr. Phillips' direction of his Division during this period is that he kept operations at the top of his priority list, and that as a result our operational achievements in the area during the past year have been on the whole better than in the year before.

Mr. Phillips is developing into a very competent manager, and has handled well the problems involved in adjusting to decreasing manpower ceilings. He is prudent in the use of official funds. He is a good supervisor and is providing excellent leadership to his subordinates, who have responded with a clear improvement in morale during the period sicce Mr. Phillips assumed charge.

The most dramatic challenge to the capabilities of the WH Division in the past year flowed from the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile. Overall, the intelligence reporting was timely and accurate, the adjustments to our political action programs skillfully made, and the responses to Congressional inquiry well handled.

It is as a senior operations officer that Mr. Phillips has had the greatest experience, and it is not surprising that he has made an excellent input into the improvement of operational matters throughout the many areas of this hemisphere for which he is responsible. He has also consistently handled the many and important senior liaison contacts which he has made during this year, both at Headquarters and during field visits, with great effectiveness.

SECTION D

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

1.  In the period covered by this report Mr. Phillips was the Chief of Station Brazilia during the time frame February to August 1,972. After that Mr. Phillips became the Chief of Station, Caracas and served in Venezuela during the period August 1972 to April 1973. At both of these posts Mr. Phillips was responsible for managing an average of 44 Agency employees. Additionally, Mr. Phillips supervised in this period an average FY budget of 1.8 million which was spent on FI, CA, CI, anti-narcotics and protected economic intelligence operations. American policy interests in Brazil and Venezuela are high in terms of the United States scale of values for Latin America. This means that Mr. Phillips was assigned to two prestige posts during a fifteen month time span.

2.  As a ınanager Mr. Phillips is operations oriented. In view of this he places his time, attention and command emphasis on programs that are de- signed to acquire intelligence and agents. This approach has consistently produced results in terms of FI and CA operations which are targeted against the host country.

3.  Mr. Phillips was also active at both posts as an operations manager who focused Station resources on the Soviet target, protected economic in- telligence and the anti-narcotics effort. Unfortunately, as these programs moved into gear Mr. Phillips was also in motion between Stations, or had just been in place at his second Station for less than a year. As a result one can only say that Mr. Phillips made all the right moves in his managerial duties against these priority targets. The brevity of his program imple- mentation at each of the two posts did not provide a solid basis, however, for measuring tangible succesa. In short Mr. Phillips deserves high marks for initiative, drive and imagination on programs that were receiving increased attention at Headquarters.

4.  The myriad problems that are faced when a Station moves its location. from one city to another were still challenging Mr. Phillips when he left Brasilia. In overview terms, however, the move from Rio de Janerio to Brasilia was well done. This does not mean that Mr. Phillips' successor at Brasilia did not have some gaps to fill or adjustments to make in the admini- strative field. The scope of these actions, however, was in the realm of the reasonable and attests to the fact that while his basic interests are in

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 136

SECRET

-2-

operations, administration per se is not a totally alien field to Mr. Phillips.

5. Ir representational terms Mr. Phillips did a sound job in winning and maintaining the respect of the American Ambassadors in Brazil and Venezuela. This is due in large measure to Mr. Phillips' native charm, area knowledge, and language skills in Spanish and Portuguese. In addition, Mr. Phillips is people oriented, and this makes it possible for him to sell himself and CIA to senior American officials at the Ambassador level.

6. In personal terms Mr. Phillips is a hard-working, dedicated officer who is a good team player. This officer has the intent, capability and desire to fulfill the needs of the Organization. He is particularly well versed in CA skills and is politically oriented. As a result he likes the challenge of election operations and is well qualified in this area.

7. Mr. Phillips' total performance during the period covered by this report merits an evaluation of Strong.

8. In terms of future assignments Mr. Phillips is likely to be at his professional best in field activities. This officer is highly specialized in Latin American affairs, but he is perfectly capable of being a Station Chief at most Agency posts in Europe or Asia.

9. Mr. Phillips' activities come to the attention of the Rating Officer on a daily basis.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT.

SUBJECT: David A. Phillips
1 July - 31 December 1971

This memorandum is in lieu of a fitness report to cover Mr. Phillips' performance during the period 1 July to 31 December 1971. This rating is being prepared in view of the rater's imminent departure from the Division.

Last month Mr. Phillips was promoted from GS-16 to GS-17. There is no better evidence of the high esteem in which he is held by his superiors in the Agency.

During this rating period Mr. Phillips transferred the station from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia. This move, however, divorces the Chief of Station from the main area of operations, Rio de Janeiro. In spite of this Mr. Phillips, through much extra effort and time on his part, has been able to maintain a high operational tempo in the station.

Station relations with key people in the Brazilian government, especially the security agencies, have been highly productive but through recent efforts, these relations have been placed on a much higher plane with the decision of General Fontoura, chief of the SNI, to give the station copies of the briefings especially prepared for President Medici.

SUBJECT: Mr. David A. Phillips
1 April 1970 - 30 June 1971

This memorandum is in lieu of the fitness report on Mr. Phillips as Chief of Station, Rio de Janeiro, during the period 1 April 1970 to 30 June 1971.

Mr. Phillips is a highly capable, versatile and imaginative Operations Officer and manager who makes a substantial contribution to the Clandestine Service.

The above statement is borne out by the fact that faced with a highly difficult, sensitive operational problem of the utmost priority in the fall of 1970, the Rater immediately thought of Mr. Phillips as the man to head the Task Force and received immediate and enthusiastic endorsement from the Deputy Director for Plans and the Director for Mr. Phillips' assignment. He was recalled from Brazil, took over the Task Force, and handled it in an outstanding manner.

My first statement is further borne out by the fact that Ambassador Rountree, on a recent visit to Washington, made a special effort to express to the Rater his appreciation for Mr. Phillips' support to him and the Embassy and to express further his appreciation to the Agency for furnishing him a man of Mr. Phillips' caliber.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Mr. David A. Phillips
1 April 1969 - 31 March 1970

This memorandum is in lieu of the fitness report on Mr. David A. Phillips as Chief of Station, Rio de Janeiro, during the period 1 April 1969 to 31 March 1970.

During this period Mr. Phillips took over command of the Rio Station. It is typical of Mr. Phillips that he made excellent preparation for this assigament, including a full-time course in the Portuguese language.

Mr. Phillips has brought to his new position the opera-tional zeal and enthusiasm that has characterized all of his previous positions. Brazil, by the very nature of its size but, more importantly, the type of "strait jacket" government in power, is à difficult place to operate on a broad plain. Mr. Phillips has the station moving and real effort and progress is seen on the more difficult targets, such as the Soviets.

He has excellent relations within the embassy and is recognized for his contribution to the Country Team. He, of course, handles his liaison contacts with mature style and is very actively developing a number of contacts in the local community.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 149

Mr. Phillips is a good supervisor of men and the present high morale of the Rio de Janeiro Station and its Bases is a living proof of this. He furnishes good operational planning and guidance and exhibits a high degree of cost consciousness.

## LANGUAGE TRAINING IMS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

The general aim of this course of study was to provide the student with a command of a foreign language in a skill and at the level set by the sponsoring office. Speaking, aural comprehension and reading comprehension, as required, were emphasized. Fluency and accuracy were given equal importance in training and in evaluation of the student. Cultural matters were covered only incidentally.

This student evaluation is based on (1) Instructor and Linguist observations; (2) regularly administered oral and written achievement tests; (3) a final comprehensive achievement examination. The achievement rating reflects only performance and achievement in the course and is conditioned by the length of time the student spent in training, achievement potentiel hased upon his or her aptitude for language study and upon motivation. This rating should not be confused with the Proficiency Rating which is submitted separately on form 1273, Certification of Language Proficiency.

## PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING COURSE AIMS

(Overall progress in the course is shown as unsatisfactory, marginal, satisfactory, above average, superior when compared against established standards for such training).

| Speaking | Aural Comprehension | Reading Comprehension |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| SUPERIOR | SUPERIOR            | N.A.                  |

## PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

In six weeks the student covered the entire DLI course of 75 lessons which usually takes 4 to 6 montas to complete. Ris study habits and approach to language learning were excellent and he made maximum use of the time available.

The joint decision by instructor and student to rush through 75 lessons was based on:

(1) the student's determination to make as much of a conversion from Spanish to Portuguese as possible and

(2) on the instructor's faith and confidence in the student's ability to do 80.

In cases where the principal objective is to convert a student's command of Spanish to an equivalent level in Portuguese, the point is often reached where the student is able to understand and make himself understood most adequately without,
See reverse side for additional comment

For the Director of Trainings

![signature of instructor and department chief]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 151

however, his having achieved a corresponding tested level because of the remining influence of Spanish.

In the case of this student, I judge his command of the language to be already adequate for all situations he may encounter in the field. So that while he may not test quite elementary, in reality, and as far as ability to communicate effectively is concerned, he would have to be rated intermediate.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Mr. David A. Phillips
1 April 1968 to 31 March 1969

Mr. Phillips continues to head the Division's program against the high-priority Cuban target, although he has also been selected to fill an unusually responsible job overseas in the coming year, both of which jobs testify to the high regard in which he is held by his superiors in the Agency. Mr. Phillips has had the difficult task of presiding over a show which is being cut back, in terms of money and people, and in which task he has played a major role. At the same time as doing a pruning job, he has had to try to maintain a vigorous program and to keep up enthusiasm. His own qualities of personal leadership and of magnetism have done a great deal to keep up enthusiasm among his people. He has a positive attitude toward operations and is determined; his day- to-day concern is for developing new operations, and he has put all of his own notable vigor and drive into operational directions.

Mr. Phillips knows his target and knows Latin America well and he brings a good feel and insight into his work, which is never pedestrian or unimaginative. He speaks well and convinc- ingly and makes a very good impression both within the Agency and outside, where he serves the Agency well in his relations with other government elements. He also writes notably well.

His task this year has not been easy for he has had to deal with an experimental situation, to a considerable extent, with the new Miami station which he is responsible for supporting and guiding. He has had to exercise a good deal of tact and diplomacy in the doing of it and he has done a good job of reconciling often conflicting views. He has shown a good head for costs in all of this.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 156

Mr. Phillips is a notably good supervisor, especially with younger officers, for whom he is an object of admiration and emulation. Mr. Phillips is a fast-moving, energetic person and he has some of the faults that often go with this virtue: he is impatient with details and "paper" with the consequence that if someone else does not do it for him, his work is sometimes marred by inaccuracies and imprecisions.

Without going into it, it should be noted that Mr. Phillips has had a very trying year personally and it is a proof of his strength of character that he has not only come through it but has hardly broken his stride in carrying out a demanding job, or being any less than his usual cheerful and charming self.

His performance has been very *Strong*.

The CAS Station Chief has been at the post only since August 13, 1972. Although this period may seem unusually short for the preparation of a performance evaluation, I would like to say that I have been enormously and favorably impressed by his performance during this initial period.

The CAS Station Chief comes to Venezuela from a series of highly responsible positions in which, I understand, he performed outstandingly. He has taken hold of his new position in a commanding manner and gives every indication of being thoroughly on top of his Job. He is understanding of the Embassy's needs, professionally competent in his approach to his work, and highly articulate in explaining those facts and factors which are of importance to me and to other officers of the Embassy.

I am very favorably impressed by the initial performance of the CAS Station Chief and I consider myself fortunate to have him with me at this post.

The previous incumbent completed his assignment at this post and departed on June 29, 1972. During the period under review he continued to perform in a highly creditable manner, working well with other members of the Embassy staff and handling the affairs of his agency in a most professional, efficient and effective manner.

In my last evaluation I stated that both the Agency and the Embassy were fortunate to have a man of the rated officer's abilities and qualities as CAS Chief at this important post. I am happy to say that his performance throughout his assignment here reinforced that view.

III. Mr. Phillips is an able officer and a highly cooperative member of the Country Team. I have been impressed and pleased with the degree of cooperation which exists between him and other members of the Embassy staff. He has, to the extent that is possible considering the nature of his work, cooperated in our efforts to bring about maximum coordination of reporting. With rare exceptions he has, I believe, kept me appropriately advised on all matters relating to his functions, and the material which he provides on a regular basis has been extremely useful in the discharge of my mission.

Mr. Phillips works quietly and discreetly and is alert to any situation which might create problems for the Embassy and the United States. I fully share the view of the DCM, expressed in a previous evaluation, that both Mr. Phillips and his wife conduct themselves in a quiet, friendly and wholly creditable manner.

I feel that both the Agency and the Embassy are fortunate in having a man of Mr. Phillips' abilities and qualities as CAS Chief at this important post.

Mr. Phillips' performance during the four months covered by this evaluation has been highly satisfactory. For some years previous to my arrival here, in June 1970, I had been acquainted with him, and from this I already had a favorable impression of his qualities. This impression has continued and has improved further. He has worked quietly and discreetly, has kept me informed of all important developments, and has coordinated as necessary with other offices in the Embassy. His interest in his work, and his dedication to the job, have been outstanding. His relations with others are very good. Because of wide previous experience in this hemisphere, he frequently is helpful to Embassy officers in areas outside his own specialization. He appears to manage his personnel well. In functions outside the Embassy, both he and his wife conduct themselves in a quiet, friendly, and wholly creditable manner.

### NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)

Phillips has been here too short a time and there has been too little opportunity for us to work together for me to be able to discuss his performance in detail. I am able to say, however, that he has impressed me and other Embassy officers with whom he works, including Ambassador Elbrick, very favorably, indeed. He is a cool-headed, straightforward, intelligent man who seems professionally very capable. He has a clear understanding of the appropriate role for himself and his organization within the Embassy and is working to achieve a genuinely low profile. He has already demonstrated his interest in the best possible relations with the rest of the U.S. Government organization and he knows how to act in order to achieve such a relationship. He has come to me a number of times to volunteer detailed information which he did not feel important enough to bother the Ambassador about, but he has kept the Ambassador fully informed about all those subjects which were of sufficient interest to him. I see every reason to assume that he will be a positive, constructive and very dependable and reliable factor in the Embassy.

Mrs. Phillips is an attractive and personable young lady who has particularly impressed my wife and me with her attitude and intellect.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS
(Attach additional sheets, if necessary for this section or for reviewing officer's comments.)

I have been associated with the CAS Station Chief since my arrival at this post on January 11, 1966, Inasmuch as I have kept in very close daily touch with him, I believe that I am in position to evaluate his performance.

Let me say at the outset that the Rated Officer has had to work under the most varied and difficult circumstances. His service at this post began, for example, in a revolutionary situation marked by great and continuing violence. The attention of a good part of the world was focused upon this situation, and some of the highest national interests of the United States were involved. The presence of the Inter-American Peace Force, of its major U.S. component, and of Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker in his unusual and unprecedented role added greatly to the dimensions of the work done by the Rated Officer. In the aftermath of revolution, he had unusual, delicate and complicated tasks to perform in connection with the establishment and maintenance in power of a most fragile Provisional Government. As the latter carried the nation toward the all-important election scheduled for June 1, 1966, the CAS Station Chief faced a changing and constantly challenging set of requirements. Finally, his tour of duty at this post has encompassed the transition from the Provisional Government to a constitutional government emerging from those elections and the gradual firming up of the position and institutions of the present democratically elected administration.

To this intricate complex of circumstances, the CAS Station Chief has brought a background knowledge of the Latin American area and its

FORM

SECRET

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 163

SECRET

- 2 -

people as well as a proficiency in Spanish which has enabled him to deal readily and effectively with a heterogeneous range of contacts.

His performance can only be described as outstanding. He has provided a completely professional response to a most difficult and varied challenge. He has mounted an organization and provided a mechanism fully up to the tasks confronting it and the high-level requirements levied upon it. With the advantages afforded by hindsight, I suggest that the success which has been achieved speaks for itself.

It is pertinent to mention that the Rated Officer invariably places business ahead of pleasure and personal interests. He works long and irregular hours and is continuously available in time of need. He has evidenced the highest degree of cooperation with representatives of State, DOD, Legal Attaché, AID (in the Public Safety sector) and all other members of the Country Team. His quiet and professional approach inspires their confidence, and on innumerable occasions he has proven that he is an excellent team player who genuinely wants to be of assistance to all members of the official community. The harmonious, close relations among all the intelligence components of the Country Team are due in great part to the tactful, skillful and thoughtful leadership of the Station Chief.

There is probably little need for me to comment upon the Rated Officer's technical achievements at this post. Under his guidance, specialized security agencies of the Dominican Government have been brought to a state of high readiness. Penetration of subversive groups has reached impressive proportions. Subversive document seizures have been abundant. Counter-espionage work has been impressively successful.

The CAS Station Chief is in/sense a narrow technician or specialist. He keeps his eye on the broad picture, understands what he sees there and intelligently relates it to his own work. He is imaginative in his approach and does not hesitate to suggest innovations of various kinds. To mention only one of these, it was as a result of his initiative that "electoral police" appeared upon the scene during the Presidential election campaign in mid-1966 with a salutary calming effect upon the potential for political violence at the moment.

I wish to make special mention of, first, the scrupulousness with which the Rated Officer has consulted me and kept me informed about his activities, and, second, his strict adherence to the guidance I have given him. At no time have I had any doubts concerning the care and fidelity with which he has followed my instructions.

I have developed the highest personal and professional regard for the Rated Officer. I have valued greatly his advice and his support not only upon matters within his own special field of competence, but also over a considerably broader spectrum of U.S. Mission activities. I could not have asked for a better Chief of Station than the one whom I have had at this post. I very much regret his departure but am comforted by the knowledge that his successor, as his deputy, has been trained by him.

I earnestly hope that these comments of mine -- based on a very close and continuous working relationship -- will be given full consideration and will contribute significantly to his career advancement.

The Rating Officer's last fitness report on Mr. Phillips dealt with his terminating an outstandingly successful and very complicated assignment as Chief of Station, Dominican Republic. This report deals with a completely different situation, i. e. coming into Headquarters as Chief, Cuban Operations Group at the time that drastic reduction had just become the order of the day. The same energy, imagination and zeal which has characterized Mr. Phillips over the years has characterized his performance in this difficult task since his assumption of the new responsibility. He has been a prime mover in reducing the Headquarters WH/COG component to realistic and managable proportions. By the same token he has been a prime mover, guider, cajoler and sometimes "patron saint" to JMWAVE management in its massive job of bringing JMWAVE down from its ponderous proportions to a viable Clandestine Services "instrument" compatible and consistent with the present day needs of Cuban operations. In this endeavor Mr. Phillips' accomplishments have been of the first order.

This is a very fine officer with one of the best potentials in WH Division. I believe the rater is somewhat carried away in his views. Mr. Phillips' career advancement has been closely observed in this Division and I do not believe he is falling behind in the promotion timetable. It is definitely expected he will be recommended next year (which is within the proper time frame,) if his current excellent performance continues.

Fitness Report - David A. Phillips

## SECTION C (Continued)

Most important however, and this is one of Mr. Phillips unique qualities, he has been able to bring about this drastic reduction and at the same time instill enthusiasm in his staff for new approaches to the ever more difficult Cuban target. His own infectious enthusiasm and his fine manner with co-workers and subordinates has made this possible. In short the Rating Officer believes he is the right man at the right time for the job he is in.

Mr. Phillips' relations with the Department of State and other agencies where it really counts are outstandingly good. He has in his short time back re-established his fine relationship with the manager of the Voice of America. This relationship will undoubtedly be of inestimable value in getting WH Division's new radio effort through the 303 Committee and into operation.

It is probably obvious to one reading this fitness report that the Rating Officer is well disposed towards Mr. Phillips. This is quite true. It in no way, however, affects the Rating Officer's opinion that Mr. Phillips is a man of considerable talent who for one reason or another has fallen at least one grade behind in the promotion timetable. The Rating Officer, therefore, trusts that this will be corrected in the near future. Mr. Phillips is a gentleman of breadth, drive, imagination and dedication. The Rating Officer considers Mr. Phillips to be one of the very best of the many fine officers he has known in his career in the Clandestine Services. In some ways he is unique in that he knows the business from the ground up, having started in unofficial cover (several assignments) and now having moved into the managerial area where he can speak with authority based on valid experience.

MAY 8 3 39 PM 67

Mr. Phillips is nearing completion of his tour of duty as Chief of Station, Santo Domingo. During the past several months he has had the difficult task of reorganizing his Station and redirecting its manpower following a major election operation. His task has been made more difficult by a series of almost weekly political or security crises which not only required intensive intelligence coverage but also frequently involved Station assets.

Mr. Phillipo has done remarkably well in this difficult regearing process. It has in no way affected the volume or quality of Station reporting which remains very high. His critical analysis and in-depth interpretation of the rapidly changing political scene have been timely and useful.

The Station under his direction has aggressively undertaken the development of new FI and CI assets without losing momentum in existing operations. Also in a relatively short period of time effective security and countersubversion units within the host government internal security apparatus have been established,

His relationships with the Ambassador and with representatives of other agencies are excellent and the high regard they accord him are reflected in the great confidence placed in him and his staff.

The overall management of the Station reflects careful consideration of manpower and money commitments. Mr. Phillips has taken the initiative in effecting savings wherever possible. In short he has turned in an aggressively outstanding performance under the most difficult imaginable conditions during the period under review.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

Mr. Phillips brings to this assignment (his first as Chief of Station) a wealth of CA experience gained through many years of operating in the Western Hemisphere and other areas. As a propagandist and general CA operator he must rank high among all Agency personnel. Consequently, it was indeed fortunate that his assignment to the Dominican Republic came at a time when a person of his talent was badly needed. Arriving shortly after the American intervention he has had the difficult task of ferreting out information in great detail about an entirely new government, diplomatically handling the delicate coordinations with other U.S. Government agencies in a crisis and highly emotional situation, while administering a rapidly expanding station composed in large degree of young men long on initiative and intelligence but somewhat lacking in depth of experience. At present he is engaged in a fairly large and vastly important election operation which is of concern to the highest authorities of our government.

Fitness Report - David A. Phillips

SECTION C Continued:

Perhaps the outstanding quality which Mr. Phillips has demonstrated is his ability to "fire up" his people to produce at their maximum capacity. Another outstanding characteristic is his diplomatic manner of dealing with other officials. Of particular note is the fact that Subject's relationship with Ambassador Bunker of the OAS (who, in effect, has been the President's principal representative in the Dominican Republic) are closer and more fruitful than the relationship of the Embassy with Ainbassador Bunker. This has in no way damaged the close relationship Subject has with the Embassy and other government officials.

Subject had little inanagerial experience of the scope required by his present position prior to his arrival in the DR, nor had he had much experience in FI matters. He has adapted readily however, and he continued to broaden in these respects with the passage of time.

Cost consciousness is, of course, a relative thing. Mr. Phillips as a CA operator "thinks big." However, it is clear that he weighs heavily costs against anticipated results and expects to get a dollar return for each one spent. Overall Subject can be described as a very able person. His ability to maintain Station morale at a high level while producing at a very gruelling pace under difficult conditions is in itself an outstandin accomplishment. Mr. Phillips has been recommended for ar Agency Award.

Chiefs of Station Seminar No. 3
60 hours, half days

19 April - 7 May 1965

Participant : PHILLIPS, David A.
Office : WII
Year of Birth: 1922
Service Designation : .D
Grade : GS-15
No. of Students : 15
EOD Date : April 1955

COURSE OBJECTIVES, CONTENT AND METIODS

The COS Seminar aimed to prepare prospective Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs of Station, Chiefs of Base, and senior Chiefs of Support for field assignments. Emphasis was upon the difficulties confronting Chiefs of small or medium-sized installations, since they must handle a peculiarly wide range of problems. Included were case studies serving to remind outgoing chiefs of various opera- tional approaches and techniques, but more time was devoted to policy, coordi- nation, management, reporting, and administrative responsibilities of the Chief of Station, both within CIA and in the government at large, at home and abroad. Special attention was given to counterinsurgency.

The bulk of the course is given in lectures and question periods conducted by officials responsible for the missions, functions, programs, and services discussed, most of them being from within the Agency but several also from out- side. A few key items of suggested reading are included, and bibliographies of suggested reading tailored to the individual's assignment are offered for those who want them,

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance.

SECTION II: OBJECTIVES OF THE COURSE

The Reading Improvement Course is designed to increase the reading efficiency of agency employees by developing their speed and level of comprehension through (1) extending the range of reading techniques, (2) adjusting rate of reading to comprehension requirements and (3) improving perceptual habits.

SECTION III: SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COURSE

The course consists of 30 class hours, one hour a day, 5 days a week. 9 hours are devoted to lectures and practice exercises, 12 hours to paced reading practice and 9 hours to specific perception techniques

Each student's reading skills are analyzed at the beginning of the course and the student then concentrates on the development of those skills in which he is deficient or those which are most frequently demanded by the nature of his office reading.

SECTION IV: METHOD OF EVALUATION

Student achievement is measured by an initial and final test battery and class exercises. Two sets of norms have been developed on the test battery. Group I represents the scores of 400 agency employees, 84% of whom had four or more years of college. Group II represents the scores of 94 agency employees with two years or less of college training. Section V contains a description of the tests and exercises. Section VI indicates the student's skill level and Section VII includes the student's over-all achievement and the instructor's comments.

OPF

Mr. David A. Phillips is retiring after a distinguished career with the Agency. He has been an employee of the Agency since 1951 when he initially joined as a Contract employee. He served with distinction in Santiago, Guatamala City, Havana, Beirut, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, and Caracas. His excollent command of both Spanish and Portuguese has enhanced each of his assignments in Latin America. A true DDOer, fifteen years of this glorious and active career were spent overseas. His outstanding dedication and devotion to the cause of freedom won for him in 1956, the Intelligence Medal of Merit.

liis file is replete with letters of commendation and appreciation from the DCI, DDCI, the former President of the Dominican Republic, Ambassadors, and military commanders, all of whom recognized the uniqueness of his outstanding service. Mr. Phillips has been highly effective as a senior member of the Latin American Division which has been under his immediate command since 1973. An excerpt from a late fitness report nicely characterizes the caliber of his work. "It is as a senior operations officer that Mr. Phillips has had the greatest experience, and it is not surprising that he has made an excellent input into the improvement of operational matters throughout the many areas of this hemisphere for which he is responsible." Mr. Phillips will be remembered for his initiative, drive and imagination, and for the excellence of his representational responsibilities which in large part is attributable to his native charm, area knowledgeability and superb language skills. He will be remembered for his intent capability and desire to fulfill the needs of the Organization. It is fitting and proper that upon his retirement, Mr. Phillips be recognized with the award of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal.

Dear Dave,

You have just finished an important albeit grueling GS-16 Evaluation Exercise at my direction. The recommendations for promotion and executive development you gave me were a major factor in my recommendations to the Director for the upward movement of officers who will be the top management cadre of the Directorate in the near future.

I believe you will find that the last several weeks will have sharpened your focus on one of our most important management responsibilities, our personnel. Many thanks for a job well done.

Chief of Station, Santo Domingo

Specific - Performance of TDY Personnel During Recent DR Crisis
ACTION REQUIRED-IF KNOWN

1. As Headquarters is well aware, a constant flow of TDY personnel was provided the Station by Headquarters during the crisis period of the recent revolution. Obviously, the Station could have found it most difficult, if not impossible, to perform in the fashion it did without this assistance. What deserves special comment, however, is the generally high quality of their performance under quite demanding, fluid, and, often, dangerous conditions. With few exceptions, already known to Headquarters, the TDY personnel did a magnificent job both collectively and as individuals. Considering the grade and experience of most of these officers, it can probably be assumed that this was to be expected. But, what clearly was not predictable was their willingness to accept any type of assignment regardless of grade or circumstances, their quick adaptability and initiative in an unfamiliar and confused situation, and their stamina under the stress of long and irregular work days seven days a week. Furthermore, in spite of the close working quarters, constant association, and strain inherent in this type of situation, "personality clashes" or other signs of incompatibility were very few indeed.

2. Undoubtedly, Headquarters has sensed the foregoing from returnees. The purpose of sending this dispatch is to make it a matter of record and to suggest to Headquarters that their standard of performance under these conditions may merit consideration of some special recognition in the personnel files of the personnel concerned.

3. Without detracting one whit from the performance of the other officers on TDY assignment, the present COS would like to single out as deserving special comment. Their performance has been exceptional. A special note is attached for Ready Vickers. Therefore, it is recommended that the attached memoranda be inserted into each of their personnel files.

4. Also, the COS would like to register the fact that the foregoing not only speaks highly of the TDY personnel assigned, but Headquarters as well in providing this type of support.

5. As a final comment, Headquarters may care to check with Edwin R. Melcan the COS for a good memorandum with either with respect to the part of this period, to obtain any special comments he might wish to make in this regard -- either with respect to content or individuals whom he considered exceptional and who are not known to the present COS.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:
Richard W. Rastetter
TDY in Santo Domingo

1.  "Rastetter" was assigned to Station Santo Domingo on a TDY basis for the period 2 June to 16 July 1965. During this assignment, Rastetter was placed in charge of the Station CA program with special emphasis on exploiting targets of opportunity in the very fluid crisis situation then prevalent and, simultaneously, generating new assets and new approaches to lay the groundwork for the altered situation which would be confronting the Station in the post-crisis era. In addition to supervising the C.A program, he handled a number of existing agents, developed some new assets, and conducted numerous special C.A operations, including some quite effective black activities. On this assignment, Rastetter worked some fourteen to sixteen hours a day throughout the entire period.

2.  The undersigned is aware that C.A would expect a quite professional and dedicated performance from an officer of Rastetter's seniority, experience, and caliber; however, even taking this into consideration, his performance in every respect was exceptional, and should merit special recognition.

3.  It is recommended that a copy of this memorandum be placed in Rastetter's personnel folder.

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation

THRU: The Honorable W. Tapley Bennett
American Ambassador
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic

TO: DAVID A PHILLIPS
American Embassy
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic

1.  I wish to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding contributions you and your staff have made in the accomplishment of USFORDOMREP Intelligence missions from 1 May 1965 through 17 January 1966. The first intelligence contact upon our arrival at San Isidro Air Base on 1 May was a representative from your office. From that day on a mutual respect, cordial relationship and a unity of effort prevailed throughout the many trying days in the Dominican Republic crisis. Without your assistance we would have realized a serious gap in the intelligence picture, a gap which would have made intelligence evaluations and the development of tactical estimates most difficult.

2.  My J2 has frequently mentioned the close association and coordination he has had with you and the members of your organization and repeatedly expressed the high esteem and respect he has for the professionalism and competence displayed by you and your subordinates.

3.  The intelligence unity of effort in the Dominican Republic has been exemplary and a prototype for future operations. This cohesive atmosphere is directly attributable to your efforts.

MEMORANDUM: FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: David A. Phillips

On 14 June 1961 the undersigned reviewed with Mr. David A. Phillips his career developinent prospects for the next five year period. We agreed that the following represented a destrable and fairly urm goal in this respect:

a. In general his future training and held experience should place sufficient stress on the CI and I nelas to avoid the career continement vi strict CA specialization,

b. His next assignment would be a normal held tour in Mexico City, Upon return from that assignment, he would receive up to six months training to be followed by an assignment to the CA Stafi (or the organizational successor thereot). Che of his primary undertakings in the CA staff would be to develop what might best be termed "ideological warfare" (e.g., a search for basic ideas and concepts with wide appeal) as opposed to the normai propaganda approach (e.g., a running debate on current everis).

Currently, your prescribed tour : consists of a period of twenty-four months from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty. Your assignment may be terminated earlier for the convenience of this organization and the length of your tour of duty, as currently specified, may be unilaterally changed by this organization in order to conform with subsequent changes in the prescribed tour of your cover facility. If you request termination of your overseas assignment solely for your own convenience, unless it is for circumstances that are considered by this organization to be beyond your control or if you are terminated for cause under the regulations of this organization before you have completed the minimum period of service prescribed above from the date of arrival at your overseas post of duty, you will not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents to the United States at Government expense.

3. Travel to your post of duty overseas and your return travel to the United States, as well as travel performed overseas which is consistent with your cover designation, will normally be at the direction of your cover facility.

4. Salary and (except as provided in paragraph three (3) above) allowances paid by your cover facility shall be retained by you to the extent that they are less than or equal to the salary and allowance payments due on the basis of your grade level with this organization.

If such cover payments exceed the amount due, the overage will be remitted to this organization at designated intervals, presently

STAFF AGENT LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

Mr. Havard Phille

Dear Mr. Phillipe

1. Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 5.2 of the Confidential Fund Regulations, you are hereby appointed a Staff Agent of the Government at an initial salary of $10, 320, grade GS-14, effective as of FEB 1956

2. As a Staff Agent of the Government, you are an appointed employee of the Government and as such are entitled to all the emoluments of, and subject to the restrictions of, that status. As a Staff Agent, you will undertake certain cover employment or activities as directed by the Government. Your Federal income taxes will be reported and paid in conformance with AFN 20-660-4, dated 26 November 1954, and/or any subsequent Government Issuances promulgated on this matter.

3. As an appointed employee of the Government, you are required to make certain contributions to the Civil Service Retirement Fund. In the event that you are paid through a cover facility, you will be required to return to the Government at such times and in such manner as it shall direct the required contributions (presently six per cent (6%) of your gross salary). If the conditions of your cover require that you make contributions to the Social Security Fund, such contribütions will be at your expense.

4. (a) In addition to your basic salary, you will be entitled to any post differential, living-quarters allowances, cost-of-living allowances (except post allowance), or other allowances that are granted Government employees stationed at the same permareat post of duty abroad. You will account for such allowances in compliance with applicable Government regulations.

(b) In addition to the above payments, effective upon the arrival of you and your dependents at your initial permanent post of duty overseas you will be entitled to an equalization allowance calculated at the rate of $3, 670 per annum. This allowance is in lieu of any present or future standardized post allowance established for your initial permanent post of duty overseas, but is subject to the entitlement provisions applicable to standardised post allowances. It is understood and agreed that this allowance is predicated upon the comparative cost of living between Washington, D. C., and your overseas post, your unofficial cover, family status and basic compensation. Consequently, this allowance may be unilaterally adjusted or discontinued by the Government whenever warranted by a change in any of these factors. No accounting will be required for this allowance.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 241

5. You will be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary expenses including travel and operational expenses which are authorized by the Government or your cover. Accountings for such expenses will be in compliance with applicable Government regulations unless such accounting is inconsistent with the practices of your cover facility. If the policies of your cover facility relating to payment of travel and transportation expenses differ from those of the Government, and if you are paid through your cover facility, you will receive and retain the amount paid by your cover without regard to Government regulations.

6. (a) It is specifically understood and agreed that as an appointed employee of the Government you are entitled to receive and retain only the salary, allowances, and other benefits which are commensurate with your appointed position and salary grade except as provided in paragraph five (5) above and paragraphs six (6), (b) and (c), below. Any compensation that you may receive from your cover facility will be offset against your salary from the Government, and you will return to the Government any salary, allowances and other pecuniary benefits which in the aggregate exceed your Government salary: allowances and other pecuniary benefits. You will report to the Government not less than semi-annually any sums received from your cover facility.

(b) It is understood and agreed that any fees derived from the remaining three (3) lectures on your current lecture tour will not be subject to the offset provisions of this agreement. It is further understood and agreed. however, that said lectures will be made by you while on annual leave and that you will be solely responsible for all expenses incidental thereto. Subsequent to the completion of said three (3) lectures, the income derived from any additional lectures will be presumed to be income derived from cover activities and will, therefore, be subject to offset unless specifically excluded by an amendment hereto.

(c) It is understood and agreed that should a specific manuscript, the title to which is set forth in your operational letter of instructions, be published during your tour of duty hereunder, the income derived therefrom will not be subject to offset as said manuscript was completed in its entirety prior to your appointment as a Staff Agent.

7. It is understood and agreed that your overseas assignment is to be for a minimum of two (2) years from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty unless such assignment shall be sooner terminated by the Government for its convenience. If, in violation of this letter, you terminate your overseas assignment for your convenience at any time prior to the expiration of two (2) years from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty, you shall not be entitled to return travel or transportation for yourself or your dependents from such post of duty to the United States; and, further, if, in violation of this letter. you terminate your overseas assignment for your converience prior to the expiration of one (1) year from the date of your arrival at your overseas post of duty. you shall reimburse the Government for all its expenses for your travel and transportation, and that of your dependents, from the continental United States to such overseas post of duty.

8. It is expressly understood and agreed that any and all documents which you may execute in the course of such cover employment are subordinate to this letter and any contradiction in terms which may in any way appear to amplify. extend or restrict your rights and/or obligations hereunder shall be resolved by this letter which shall always be dominant.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 242

9. Upon termination of your cover employment or activity, you will revert to normal staff employee status, unless for good and sufficient cause, such as misconduct or demonstrated incompetence, such aversalca would ba opposed to the best interest of the Government.

10. If. in the performance of your cover service, you assume the custody of Government funds or take title of record to, property of any nature whatsoever situate which property has in fact been purchased with monies of the U. S. Government, you hereby recognize and acknowledge the existence of a trust relationship, either express or constructive, and you agree to execute whatever documents may be required by the Government to evidence this relationship.

11. Instructions received by you from the Government in briefing or training are a part of this letter and are incorporated herein, provided that such instructions are not inconsistent with the terms hereof.

12. You will be required to keep forever secret this letter and all information which you may obtain by reason hereof (unless released in writing by the Government from such obligation), with full knowledge that violation of such secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the Espionage Laws, dated 25 June 1948, as amended, and other applicable laws and regulations.

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER

The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall determine to his own satisfaction that this appointment would be in conformance with the Civil Service Act, applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations and acts of Congress pertaining to appointment.

This form should be consulted for holding of office, pension, suitability in competition with any record of recent discharge or arrest, and particularly for the following:

(1) Identity of appointee-It is the duty of the appointing officer to guard against impersonation and to determine beyond reasonable doubt that the appointee is the same person whose appointment was authorized. The appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application and or other pertinent papers. If the appointee qualified in a written exami- nation, the signature on this form should be compared with the signature on the declaration sheet, which was signed in the examination room. His physical appearance may be compared against the medical certificate. The appointee may also be questioned on his personal history for agreement with his previous statements

(2) Age -If definite age limits have been established for the position, it should be determined that t applicant is not outside the age range for appointment. Until such determination is made, the appointment may not be consummated.

(3) Citizenship The appointing officer is responsible for observing the citizenship provisions of (1) the Civil Service Rules and (2) appropriate acts. Form 61 constitutes an affidavit for both purposes and is acceptable proof of citizenship status in the absence of conflicting circumstance. In such case the appointment should not be consummated until clearance has been secured from the certifying office of the Civil Service Commission.

(4) Members of Family-Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that whenever there are already two or more members of a family serving under probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service, no other member of such family is eligible for probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service. The appointments of persons entitled to veterans preference are are subject to this requirement. The members of family provision does not apply to temporary appointments. Doubtful cases may be referred to the appropriate office of the Civil Service Commission for decision.

## Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the North Fork Payette River Project Modification Project, Valley and Boise Counties, ID

SUMMARY: The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the North Fork Payette River Project Modification Project (Project) in Valley and Boise Counties, Idaho. The Project would modify the existing Cascade Reservoir Dam (Dam), owned and operated by Reclamation, to increase storage capacity by constructing a concrete raise to the existing Dam. Reclamation is initiating the EIS to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

Reclamation invites Federal, State, and local agencies; Tribes; and the public to provide comments concerning the scope of the EIS, including identification of potential issues, alternatives, and information relevant to the analysis. Reclamation will hold a public scoping meeting to provide information and to solicit public comments.

DATES: Written comments on the scope of the EIS must be received by Reclamation on or before [Insert date 30 days after date of publication in the FEDERAL REGISTER]. Reclamation will announce the date, time, and location of the public scoping meeting at least 15 days in advance through a press release to local media and postings on Reclamation’s website at: https://www.usbr.gov/pn/programs/ cascade/index.html.

ADDRESSES: You may submit written comments by email to cascade@usbr.gov, or by mail to Dale Ryerson, Bureau of Reclamation, 1150 North Curtis Road, Suite 100, Boise, ID 83706.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dale Ryerson, Bureau of Reclamation, 208-383-2264, cascade@usbr.gov.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Reclamation proposes to increase the storage capacity of Cascade Reservoir by constructing a concrete raise to the existing Dam (Project). The Project purpose is to improve operational flexibility to meet existing water rights and authorized purposes, and to improve the ability to manage flows to benefit aquatic resources downstream of the Dam. The Project includes modification of the existing Dam, and associated infrastructure such as, but not limited to, relocating utilities and highways, modifying existing recreation facilities, and acquiring additional land. The proposed action would increase the reservoir’s full pool elevation by approximately 7 feet, which would result in approximately 28,000 acre-feet of additional storage capacity. The Project is located approximately 4 miles south of Cascade, Idaho, along the North Fork Payette River in Valley and Boise Counties, Idaho.

Reclamation will evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Project in the EIS. Potential environmental impacts include, but are not limited to, changes to water resources, fisheries and aquatic resources, terrestrial wildlife and vegetation, threatened and endangered species, air quality, noise, recreation, visual resources, cultural resources, socioeconomics, and transportation.

BACKGROUND ON REQUEST FOR CREDITABLE SERVICE: August 1950 Until 3 March 1954

1.  A basic document in consideration of this request is HCSA-825, dated 4 February 1954.

2.  I was running an English-language newspaper in Santiago, Chile when asked to work with our Station there. My first pay was $50.00 per month. The file contains a project approval dated 31 May 1950; TCS-A-1064 asks that the first payment be made to the U.S. bank on 1 August 1950.

3.  During this period I recall a number of activities undertaken for the Station, and I travelled to New York for clandestine training. The file indicates "He was originally approved operationally to handle the complex Soviet espionage case of FULMINATER-2. His conduct of this case was considered excellent...." Also, "It will be recalled that Headquarters was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done." The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when I stayed behind in my plant after the employees had left for the night, printing leaflets, booklets, etc. I also handled agents and did a number of spotting and assessing jobs for the Station.

4.  I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for $500.00 per month which ran until the termination date of 31 August 1953. (Actually this was in the form of a loan which was paid off at the rate of $500.00. The advance was used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do certain work for the Station, but which I retained.)"

5.  After termination of the contract on 31 August I remained in Chile until 4 March 1954. During this period I recruited a CP agent who still works for the Station--and was a cabinet member under Allende. On 3 February 1954 Headquarters asked that I be made available for another assignment. The Station pointed out that I was working on the recruitment, and that I and my family were planning on a European vacation. Headquarters again requested my assignment. Thus I departed for the Guatemala project in early March, abandoning my free family trip to Europe (tickets paid for by advertising in my paper) and leaving my family behind to pack up. I accepted this assignment without knowing where it was, or for how long it would last. Indeed I did not even have a contract.

6. I worked for the Agency in Santiago, then, between 1 August 1950 until departure for PBSUCCESS on 4 March 1954. I was always available and when I finally did leave it was for Agency business rather than my own. Thus I request that all or part of this time be approved as creditable toward retirement."

1. Adeles Hope the following with help yous

(a) Attached is our CPD file on-loan. In it find a chrono of all of subject's contract barvico.

(b) Information in our CPD momo of 30 June 66 is reaffirmed. liow-over, note it did not cite subject's 1951/52/53 service, which service is cited in the O/Finance momo of 16 June 1966. This 1951/52/53 service is independent contractor service and not creditable for purposes of Civil Service Rotirement.

(c) Our CPD Remo of 30 Jun 66 indi-catos subject as had a sociel security obligation for period 1 Jan 55 tira 31 Mar 55. Since this oblication came about retroactively in illd 1955, possibility exists that noither subject or the Agency mado contri-butions to the Social Security System. If they were not made, it is possible for such to bo wade at this late date and if subject or Wil Division is in-torosted in looking into this, they should contact Rod Irooks of CPD.

SUBJECT

Request for Review of Retirement Status---Michael C. CHOADEN

Action Required: See Paragraph 9 et all

1.  During his RVROCK career Michael C. CHOADEN has served as Contract Agent, Covert Associate, Staff Agent and Contract Employee. On one occasion CHOADEN resigned from RVROCK, became a Contract Agent, then returned as a Staff Employee. The purpose of this dispatch is to request a review of exactly what CHOADEN'S status has been over the years, what must be done to repay retire- ment funds for any periods of creditable service not now covered, and to study the possibility that some periods of tenure might be converted from uncreditable to creditable status.

2.  CHOADEN served in the Air Force from February 1943 through October 1945, with total service of two years, eight months and 19 days.

3.  The dates of CHOADEN's first RVROCK service in Santiago, Chile, are very hazy to CHOADEN. He does recall that he was first recruited by the COS, but cannot recall if this was on a formal, salaried basis. At some time during 1950 or 1951, probably the latter, CHOADEN signed an RVROCK contract, for at least two years, possibly longer. The salary is remembered as US$500 per month, and on one occasion this salary was paid in advance to allow CHOADEN to purchase printing equipment. Please check the contract covering this period and advise Rio (a) the duration of the con- tract and (b) if any provision for deductions (or future payment of) was made. If, as CHOADEN suspects, there were no deductions, even for Social Security, CHOADEN would appreciate Headquarters comment on the possibility that this period might be retroactively converted to creditable service status (after payments into retirement system, of course). In this connection it is suggested

that a discussion might be held with James G. COLLETT, who was COS in Santiago during most of that time. CHOADEN believes that COLLETT w11l confirm that CHOADEN demonstrated his intense interest in his RVROCK work by performing not only the work called for in his contract (mostly clandestine printing) bit other chores as well... Example: during this period, or perhaps just after the expiration of CHOADEN's contract, CHOADEN, under Station guidance and instruction, approached and recruited a Communist Party agent. (It is understood that the agent is still reporting.) Another example: in March 1954, COS COLLETT approached CHOADEN and asked him if he would accept the Headquarters! request that he leave Chile, board an airplane for the U.S. and assist in an unidentified operation which would last "some months." That was the extent of the offer. CHOADEN accepted. This was despite the fact that he had no contract, and that he had to leave his family behind and to abandon a trip which had been planned through Europe. It is believed that this indicates that CHOADEN was pretty much "under RVROCK control" during this period. (Perhaps training records can assist in finding information on this Chilean period, as CHOADEN went to New York on one occasion for a six-week training course).

4. The next period of contract employment is also hazy. The operation in which CHOADEN was asked to participate turned out to de PBSUCCESS. Some sort of contract was drawn up, but CHOADEN does not recall if any deduction for retirement was made, nor of the terms of the contract. It is requested that this contract be reviewed and, should there have been no retirement credit, that it too be reviewed for possible conversion to creditable service. There is no question of CHOADEN "responding to RVROCK control" during this period. It was full time work, and most of it per-formed away from family---some of it in the jungle. About sixty days, CHOADEN recalls, was spent in Project PEHISTORY. CHOADEN was awarded an RVROCK decoration for his work during this period. ABROAD.

5. As the result of his participation in PRSUCCESS, CHOADEN was contracted as a Covert Associate from (about; this is a guess) October, 1954 until April of 1955. CHOADEN distinctly recalls that this contract called for rotirement credit if chosen as a future option. (It is not impossible that this contract was made retroactive to cover CHOADEN's departure from Chile in March, 1954.) It would be appreciated if Rio would be advised of the exact dura-tion and terms of this contract.

6. CHOADEN was-a-Staff Employee from 1 April 1955 until 13 July of 1958, when he resigned. Retirement payments for this period were returned to CHOADEN, and he understands that they must be repaid sometime before retirement to make the period creditable.

7. After resigning in 1953 CHOADEN went to Cuba and within a week signed a contract---as an independent operator and, to the best of CHOADEN's recollection, without any retirement benefits. Again, it is requested that this contract be reviewed with the view of possible conversion to creditable status.

8. On March 14, 1960 CHOADEN again became a Staff Employee, and has remained in that status.

9. Despite a rather long tenure with RVROCK CHOADEN now finds that mich of his service is either not creditable, or is creditable and not paid. CHOADEN would like to set this house in order, and to begin having regular deductions from his salary begin building up his paid-up creditable retirement equities. Headquarters' assistance in arriving at this happy state would be appreciated. CHOADEN is especially interested in obtaining approval for con-version of the early contract days in Chilo. It seems apparent that if repayment into the retirement system is to be initiated,

it would be wiser to repay the early years first (so as to add more time more quickly with less payment). In any event, a Headquarters' review of the case would be appreciated.

Pending publication of a regulation on Employee Services, the Office of Personnel lssued N 20-660-19, dated 29 July 1954 to be effective 1 August 1954. This Notice announced the availability of two life insurance and two health insurance programs sponsored by the Agency under the name of "Government Employees Health Association, Inc." Eligibility for these life and health insurance programs has been limited to those categories of personnel expressly stipulated in the Notice. Nowhere are Covert Associates listed as an eligible group, although in fact a Covert Associate may be an employee of the U.S. Government. Until the notice or the proposed regulation is changed, this Staff is precluded from inserting in contracts similar to that of subject individual's any reference to health and life insurance programa normally available to staff employees.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Kermit Roosevelt

ATTENTION : Mr. John Baker

SUBJECT : Mr. Paul D. Langevin; Employment as CIA
Staff Officer

1. To those of us at Headquarters who have followed closely the work of Mr. Langevin in connection with PBSUCCESS, it is completely evident that he made one of the major and most outstanding contributions to this Operation and that he has demonstrated himself to be exceptionally qualified in the field of political and psychological operations (covert). I have just been informad by Messrs. Barnes and Langevin that the latter who has heretofore been employed in the capacity of a Contract Agent, desires to become more closely associated with the Agency and would like to be employed as a regular staff officer. I am very much in favor of following up on this opportunity, and I have good reason to believe that the Director likewise is specifically interested.

2. There are certain aspects of this case which appear to require special handling and tailoring -- none of which presents any difficulties as I see it -- but, on the contrary, would tie in very neatly with both the near term and longer range aspects of the employment of Mr. Langevin. These aspects are as follows:

(a) Mr. Langevin desires to begin his term of employment by the Agency with a period of service at Headquarters. (He has spent many years in Latin America, principally in Chile where he has owned and still owns a newspaper, and, in my judgment, it would be mutually advantageous to the Agency and to Mr. Langevin for him to spend not less than a year as a member of the Headquarters organization.)

(b) Mr. Langevin has for some years in the past been giving an annual series of lectures in various Latin American capitals. These lectures have been arranged by an agent of his in New York and his audiences have consisted of business and professional groups and women's organ- izations. The general subject matter of his lectures has included talks on the threat of international Communism to Latin America. Mr. Langevin would desire, if it can be worked out, to be permitted to continue to deliver lectures of this kind in the future and is at the present time


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 349

contemplating a series of lectures on Latin America to be given in various
cities within the United States.

(c) Mr. Langevin would be ready and able to accept a field assignment
in South America following the conclusion of the period of Headquarters'
duty referred to.

3. As already indicated, it seems to me that there are no sérious
   problems involved in any of the foregoing and that the material can be
   readily cut to fit the pattern. It is the recommendation of Mr. Barnes in
   which I concur, that Mr. Langevin be assigned to the PP Staff during his
   tour of duty here. He could in this capacity work very closely with WH
   Division, but it seems to Tracy and myself that he can contribute importantly
   to the work of the PP Staff and in the process broaden himself. As regards
   the matter of the lectures, I would recommend that arrangements be made
   to permit and even encourage him to continue these since it seems to me
   that they would fit in very well with his general PP assignment assuming, of
   course, that his Headquarters and field cover are properly designed and main-
   tained. The Headquarters cover problem is not a substantial one and as far
   as the field is concerned if Mr. Langevin were to go under nor-official cover
   of the right kind this also should present no problem. There is a ready-
   made cover in the field and in a critically important country by virtue of
   his ownership-- for some six years of a newspaper in Santiago. It
   would not be incompatible with his resumption of his position as owner and
   editor of the Santiago newspapaer to work in an annual series of lectures
   either in Latin America or in the United States. There is only one further
   point involved in connection with the lectures: Because of Mr. Langevin's
   intimate association with many of the details of PBSUCCESS and also in
   light of the standing rules of the Agency, it would be desirable for him to
   submit at least in general outlines, and preferably textually to the extent
   feasible, the substance of his proposed lectures. He is anxious to do this
   in connection with the forthcoming lectures for his own piece of mind
   since he would like to be double-checked on the things which he should say-
   and those which he should not say with respect to the Guatemalan development.
   He could and in the material to Mr. Holcomb or myself or to you - and
   after it has been checked over by one of us, we could arrange to submit it
   to the Office of Security for such further checking as may be desirable.

4. Mr. Langevin proposes to take a leave of absence of a month or
   six weeks, starting within the next few days. I believe it would be
   desirable for Mr. Baker, to start the necessary personnel and other admin-
   istrative actions, including any additional security clearances which may


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 350

which may be necessary, etc., looking toward having everything in line for Mr. Langevin to come aboard officially at the conclusion of this leave.

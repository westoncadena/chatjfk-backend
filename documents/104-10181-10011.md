Report lio. 314

5 May 1970

FRANCO-enters the office. They mention the incident that happened last night at Barajas airport when the plane arrived from Havana. A woman (Spanish) raised her unbrelia and threatened HORACIO, while a gusano kept hitting him. FRANCO says that he hit five or six of the attackers real hard, and that he thinks he really hurt one of them quite badly around the face and head. Everyone was covered with blood.

A woman and a non come into the office and talk about the incident (above) also. Then the girl says that she has come to Spain to take a course in Alcala. It seems that the course is connected with UNESCO. She will later go to the University of Santender and on to Paris to take a course there. She says she is a member of the Party, and wants to know how she is going to maintain her contact here in Spain. RUIZ says that they too are members, but that due to the difficulty of public relations that it is a month and a half since they have had a group meeting. He says that the work that they are doing makes it difficult to carry on the Party life, but that never- theless it is necessary to have group meetings to discuss the members. She says that she would like to live in Madrid, in a student residence, and commute to Alcala by car, or bus every day. Ruiz says that in this way it would be more economical for her and she would have more contact with the other students. She says that she would like to be in some Spanish-American college to get acquainted with the students there. RUIZ says she could be very useful to them with her student connections, and that without interfering with her studies she can also be helping Cuba. He highly recommends that she get every thing she can, culturally, during her stay in Spain. He says that for very much she has read about museums and historical and artistic places it is quite different seeing them.

Ruiz asks her to leave her address at the embassy so that the President of the Women's Federation of the Party can take advantage of her being of use to them in one way or another. Ruiz tells her that anything that might happen to her to come to the embassy and let them know about it. He says there is the danger that they will spy on her or follow her and that there is the possibility of enemies getting close to her. He says that everyone makes mistakes and that if she does to let them know at once so that they can prevent the consequence, and give her good advice.

He has been out of the office for a long time. At about 2:30 pm he comes in with BARREDA and another person. Ruiz says that he has to write to the Deputy Secretary (of Foreign Relations-?) about the incident at Farajas airport. He is going to point out the permissiveness of the police. He is going to point out that the officials of the embassy were provoked by the others

1. WE BELIEVE THAT CHANCE ENCOUNTER WITH AMAUTO-1 IS
   ALONE TOO DIFFICULT TO ARRANGE SINCE AMAUTO-1 IS
   FREQUENTLY IN COMPANY SOMEONE FROM HIS STAFF OR HAVING
   LUNCH WITH SPANISH OFFICIALS OR BUSINESSMENT. MOREOVER,
   ENCOUNTER UNDER THIS SITUATION, WE FEEL, WOULD NOT PERMIT
   RELAXED EX CHANGE BETWEEN SAMKO AND AMAUTO-1. WE WOULD
   LIKE TO SUGGEST FOLLOWING ALTERNATIVE:

A. ON ARRIVAL SPAIN VIA AERONAVES DE MEXICO
FLIGHT 450 LEAVING MIAMI FRIDAY SAMKO WOULD GO DIRECTLY
TO HOTEL OF STATION SELECTION. STATION OFFICER WILL ALSO
OCCUPY HOTEL IN ALIAS AND INITIAL CONTACT WITH SAMKO WILL
BE MADE IN HOTEL. (INCIDENTALLY, BELIEVE NO NEED
PA CHA NKIS ACCOMPANY SAMKO TO MADRID.)

B. EARLY SUNDAY AFTERNOON SAMKO WOULD GO DIRECTLY
TO AMAUTO-I'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE. HIS EXCUSE WILL BE
THAT HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO EMBASSY BUT WAS CERTAIN THAT

EMBASSY WOULD BE CLOSED. IN ADDITION, SINCE SAMKO
SCHEDULED TOUR OF MADRID AND SUBURBS LEAVING EARLY
MONDAY MORNING DECIDED MAKE EFFORT CONTACT AN AUTO-1-
AT HOME RATHER THAN POSSIBLY MISS OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HIM.
(SAM KOVILL, BE INSTRUCTED TO SIGN UP FOR TOUR OF CITY
TO LEND AUTHENTICITY TO STORY.) SAMKO WILL HAVE TO
BE PREPARED REPLY TO INEVITABLE QUESTION FROM AMAUTO-18
HOW DID YOU FIND MY ADDRESS? SAM KO'S REPLY WOULD BE
THAT HE OBTAINED ADDRESS FROM IBERIA EMPLOYEE AT AIRPORT
WHO SPENT CONSIDERABLE TIME TRYING TO LOCATE AMAUTOT 1
RESIDENCE. CADDRESS APPEARS IN DIP LIST AVAILABLE
OVERTLY.) SAM KO WOULD FURTHER EXPLAIN, IF NECESSARY,
THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW EMPLOYEE GOT ADDRESS, BUT KNOWS
SNK MADE NUMBER OF TELEPHONE CALLS. WE CANNOT PREDICT
AMAUTO-1'S REACTION TO THIS DIRECT APPROACH. HE MIGHT
CLAIM PRESS OF BUSINESS OR OTHER COMMITMENTS THEREBY
REFUSING SEE SAMKO IN HOME BUT MIGHT SUGGEST THAT SANKO
VISIT ENBASSY MONDAY MORNING. SAMKO SHOULD BE PREPARED
TO SAY THAT IF THIS WOULD NOT EMBARRASS AMAUTO-I НЕ

SUSPICION. SAMKO'S APPROACH TO AMAUTO-I RESIDENCE CAN
BE MONITORED FROM HOMES OF TWO STAFFERS WHO LIVE WITHIN
EYSHOT OF ANAUTO-I'S RESIDENCE.

C. AMAUTO-I'S PROBABLE SECOND QUESTION: HOW DID
SAM KO KNOW HE WAS IN MADRID? REQUIRES MORE THOUGHT AND
HELP FROM MIAMI. IDEALLY, SAMKO SHOULD BE ABLE SAY THAT.
A MUTUAL FRIEND OF BOTH AMAUTO-I AND SAMKO WERE TOGETHER
RECENTLY IN MIAMI AND AMAUTO-I'S NAME MENTIONED. SAMKO
ASKED WHAT HAPPENED TO AMAUTO-I AND FRIEND DISCLOSED THAT
AMAUTO-1 NOW "AMBASSADOR" TO SPAIN. (SUBJECT WH/MIAMI 7595
(IN 085476))
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE "FRIEND" WHOSE NAME SAMKO MIGHT
USE. STATION SUGGESTS THAT CONTACT BE MADE WITH SUBJECT
IN LOS ANGLELES TO DETERMINE WHETHER HE KNOWS WHERE
AMAUTO-1 IS. ALSO OBTAIN PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION, OCCUPATION
IN LA AND PRIOR JCB IN MIAMI PLUS OTHER NOTABLE
CHARACTERISTICS WHICH COULD BE USED AS FILLER BY SAMKO

SENSITIVE AND USUALLY RELIABLE.

1. IN EARLY MAY 1970, THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN MADRID
   PREPARED A PROTEST NOTE TO THE SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY OVER
   AN INCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED AT THE BARAJAS AIRPORT IN MADRID
   BETWEEN CUBAN REFUGEES AND CUBAN OFFICIALS, IN WHICH BLOWS
   WERE EXCHANGED. ACCORDING TO MINISTER GUILLERMO RUIZ,
   CUBAN CHARGE D'AFFAIRES, THE EMBASSY WILL CHARGE THAT SIX
   FUNCTIONARIES AND FOUR DIPLOMATIC COURIERS FROM HAVANA WERE
   PHYSICALLY ATTACKED ON 4 MAY AT THE AIRPORT BY DISAFFECTED

DOCUMENTS AND COULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACT BUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF REPEATED PROVOCATIONS AT BARAJAS. SPANISH AUTHORITIES WERE ASKED TO PREVENT A REPETITION OF THESE INCIDENTS.

2. (FIELD COMMENT: ACCORDING TO ANOTHER UNTESTED SOURCE WHO WAS AN EYEWITNESS TO THE 4 MAY INCIDENT, THE CROWD INCLUDED 23 MEMBERS OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY AND A NUMBER OF CUBAN EXPATRIATES MEETING AN IBERIA FLIGHT FROM HAVANA WHICH WAS CARRYING 75 CUBAN OFFICIALS AND 30 CUBAN REFUGEES. MAXIMO TORRES, FORMER MAYOR OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA AND A MAN OF OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE, ADDRESSED ONE OF THE ARRIVING CUBAN OFFICIALS, MISTAKING HIM FOR A REFUGEE. THE OFFICIAL REBUFFED HIM RUDELY AND A GENERAL ARGUMENT ENSUED AND BLOWS WERE EXCHANGED. HORACIO FUENTES MARTINEZ, FIRST SECRETARY OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY, JUMPED FROM A NEARBY CAR AND PISTOL-WHIPPED ONE OF THE REFUGEES. AFTER THE POLICE ARRIVED, TORRES AND HIS WIFE NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION.)

3. ON 6 MAY, ROBERTO FRANCO OLIVA, CUBAN CONSUL IN MADRID, COMPLAINED TO A SPANISH POLICE INSPECTOR CONCERNING THE INCIDENT AT THE AIRPORT AS FOLLOWS:

A. THE SCENE' AT THE AIRPORT HAD BEEN PREPARED BY ГНЕ U.S. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) AND 'COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES."

THE INSPECTOR REPLIED TO THIS THAT SPANISH AUTHORITIES WERE

INVESTIGATING AND WOULD GIVE CUBAN OFFICIALS THE PROTECTION IN
SPAIN WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE. HE SAID THAT THREE CUBAN REFUGEES
HAD BEEN ARRESTED AND WOULD BE DEPORTED TO FRANCE. FOR THEIR
PART, THE REFUGEES HAD SAID THAT HORACIO FUENTES HAD PULLED
OUT A GUN DURING THE FIGHT, A CHARGE WHICH FRANCO DENIED AT
LENGTH.

B. MANY OTHER ATTACKS HAVE BEEN SUFFERED BY CUBAN
OFFICIALS AT THE AIRPORT AND DAMAGE DONE TO THEIR PARKED CARS.

C. WHEN CUBAN SEAMEN ARE ARRESTED BY THE SPANISH
POLICE IN THE CANARY ISLANDS THEY ARE INTERROGATED SEPARATELY
IN THE POLICE STATION BY AN AGENT OF THE CIA WHO IS A CUBAN
"GUSANO" (TURNCOAT).

D. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SPANISH REPUBLICANS AND
SPANISH COMMUNISTS IN CUBA, THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN HAVANA IS
NEVER MOLESTED.

E. FRANCO IS PREPARED TO ADVISE CUBAN PASSENGERS
COMING TO SPAIN TO CARRY RAZORS FOR SELF DEFENSE, CUBAN OFFI-
CIALS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO GO TO THE AIRPORT, SHOULD APPLY
FOR LICENSES TO CARRY PISTOLS.

4. (FIELD COMMENT: ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL SPANISH
   SERVICE, CUBAN DIPLOMATS MAY APPLY FOR GUN PERMITS TO THE
   SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY AND WOULD PROBABLY RECEIVE PERMISSION.

1. VIEW REF B, HQS SANGUINE ABOUT POSSIBILITIES OF "CHANCE" APPROACH BY SAMKO TO AMAUTO-1. AS REASONABLY WELL OFF RETIRED PERSON, SAMKO COULD NATURALLY CO TO MADRID AS TOURIST. HQS WONDERS WHETHER THIS WOULD HOLD WATER UNLESS WIFE ACCOMPANIED HIM. REQUEST MIAMI INVESTIGATE THIS POINT.

2. APPROACH BY SAMKO WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT LEAD TO RECRUITMENT, BUT WOULD OFFER PERSONAL READING OF AMAUTO-1 BASED ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE WARM ENTREE PROVIDED BY FONDLY-REMEMBERED PAST ASSOCIATION. IF APPROPRIATE, SAMKO COULD PROVIDE LINK TO "OTHER WORLD" IN CASE AMAUTO-1 EVER NEEDED HELP. LATTER SCHEDULED TRAVEL HAVANA IN JUNE 70 AND RETURN MADRID PRIOR POSTING CUBA. JUDGING FROM AMBEDEW-1 AND AMDELAY-1 CASES, BRIEF RETURN TO CUBA MIGHT PROVE TURNING POINT IN ANY DECISION TO DEFECT. THEREFORE, ANY MEETING WITH SAMKO SOULD BE PRIOR JUNEDEPARTURE.

1. The following information about Subject's trip to Spain and her activities while here was obtained from QUI IM ID and QUDOZE.

2. Subject arrived in Madrid on 10 February 1970. She traveled to Barcelona during the week of 23 February and returned to Madrid 6 March whereupon she then left for Portugal. She returned to Madrid on 17 March and waited for Guillermo R U I Z. Perez' return from the Spanish/Cuban Commercial nego- tiations in Cuba. Sonia departed Madrid for Cuba on 27 March 1970. It appears that she intended to travel to Vienna, Austria next, since several cables were sent to Vienna from Madrid advising Sonia's travel status. During her stay in Spain, Sonia was in frequent contact with one Jose Agustin GOYTISOLO Spanish writer in Barcelona, telephone 228-4063 (Station traces are OSBA 02385, 17 February 1965; OSBA 02718, 11 August 1967; and OSBA 02795, 1 March 1968). She was not known to have been in contact with any other locals and what little time she had for diversion she spent with the mission officers and their wives.

### 3. The purpose of Sonia's trip to Madrid was to discuss
the 1970 work plan for the Embassy with the Charge, Guillermo
RUIZ Perez. She also talked with the various Embassy officials,
most probably to familiarize herself with their duties and to
see if they had any problems. She pitched in and helped with
the backlogged work of Orestes BARREDA and Horacio
FUENTE Sand also helped with the cultural activities.
For instance, she sent two cables to MINREX-one regarding
the forwarding of movie posters for a March exhibit and another
regarding the forwarding of a Cuban stamp exhibition by end
March.

### 4. In their discussion of the 1970 work plan Sonia told
RUIZ that they were going to plan the February, March, and
April quarter. She showed him "an agenda for the control of
planned and unplanned activities" and the general directives of
the plan which included scientific information and political
information, with specific directives (requirements) for Spain.
RUIZ has to prepare for Havana a monthly report, then a quarterly
summary, of the activities accomplished. Eased on these
reports the activities of the following quarter wiil be planned.

a. In line with the plan of scientific
information, Sonia and RUIZ discussed the pros
and cons of a Comite Cientifico-Tecnico which
is to be set up in Madrid. RUIZ was of the
opinion that the local (Spanish) Communist
Party would try to infiltrate it and this
would bring problems to the Embassy. Sonia
pointed out the successes encountered in
Switzerland and Sweden with such a committee
even though at first there were problems
which were later overcome.

b. Sonia showed RUIZ a commercial project
which she planned to take to Portugal and
asked him to read it because it was also of
interest to the Cuban mission in Spain.

c. Sonia mentioned that the Plan of
Information was still to be completed especially
in the priority categories of livestock and
economy.

d. They turned next to the topic of
the budget. Sonia said that the budget
for each mission had to be submitted before
the end of April (every year) and no additional
expenditures could be submitted for approval
during the course of the year. Spain, Canada,
and France, however, would be treated individually.
Their special needs, such as acquisition of
more office space, raises in cost of living
allowances, etc., would be taken into consideration
at any time.

DISPATCH SECRET OSMA - 26318

5. During their various discussions RUIZ aired his
   complaint about the visa Department in Havana saying that
   the department was practically worthless and that last your
   76 cables regarding visas remained unanswered. Senia
   defended the Ministry saying that it had a lot of work to
   do, but RUIZ replied that they wanted to work only 8 hours
   a day. They also discussed the scholarship situation. It
   seems that during an interview between P R I E T O (Probably
   Jose PRIETO Benitez, Director of Foreign Relations of
   the DAP) and the Minister of Public Works, PRIETO was asked
   to provide a list of scholarship candidates to be considered
   and be had none. Sonia mentioned that in Belgium they also
   lost four scholarships because of this same reason.

6. According to QUTIMID Sonia GOMEZ Aragon is
   married to one Miguel (LNU) and has a daughter named Iliana.
   Sonia's mother is still living although appeared to be very
   ill at the time Sonia left for her trip to Madrid because
   Sonia cabled at least twice to Havana inquiring about the
   Estatus of her mother's health. (TYLOTE reported that Sonia's
   home phone number in Havana is 7-4263.) Perhaps Headquarters
   can determine the full name of her husband by checking the..
   reverse telephone listings: Sonia is attractive, intelligent,
   sertious-minded and reserved. The last time she visited Spain
   she stayed with Vera B O R O D O W S K I. and was on the sans
   type of mission as the present one to discuss the Madrid
   Embassy's work plan. She also visited the Barcelona Consulate
   and the Cuban Embassy in Lisbon.

POSITION:
Minister, Charge d'Affaires, Cuban Embassy,
Madrid, since December 1967.

WIFE:
Nilda VECIANA Lopez (DPOB: 26 December 1934,
Havana)

PHYSICAL
DESCRIPTION:

tall, and 170-190 pounds, stout build;
round face, fair complexion, blond slightly
wavy hair, light-colored eyes (also reported
as blue and green), wears glasses. No
visible identifying marks. Well dressed.

PERSONALITY:
Perhaps a relative's description of RUIZ
sums up his personality - "a man of many
moods." He has variously been described
as intelligent, mentally alert, competent,
hardworking, and respected by his subordinates.
Pleasant, easy going, nervous, quick-tempered,
brusque but sincere, opinionated, strong-minded
idealistic, self-confident. Has basic
emotional instability, gives impression
of being insecure in his position. At times
sarcastic, indifferent, egotistical, cynical,
serious, ungrateful and cold, who,
paradoxically, appears friendly to some people.
Outspoken, compulsive talker, articulate,
limited vocabulary, swears a good deal.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez

## EDUCATION:

He can turn on considerable charm, where motivated. In contrast to his pleasant public image and acceptable language, private conversation is vulgar, swears continually and flies into rages.

Likes good living and spends money where it shows. Avid reader, keeps abreast of world events, shows willingness to accept whatever he deems to be good or useful from the outside world. Concerned with the image and prestige of Cuba in Spain. Emotionally committed to an ideal. An AMEDIT study summed RUIZ up as a realist. He speaks English and French. His wife, a teacher, always worked before going to Spain, and there works as a secretary and bookkeeper at the Embassy on an informal basis. intelligent, competent, outspoken but solicitious and affectionate with her husband; interested in, and. encourages him in his work. Appears to support the regime, but not a fanatic. Appears RUIZ is the dominant personality of the two.

One reference states that he went to work at age 14, which suggests lack of formal education.

In 1960 as an employee of the Ministry of the Treasury, selected to attend a statistics course offered by CEPAL, which lasted two years.

One relative reported he completed elementary education at "Hermanos Maristas" school in Havana; did not know whether he attended high school, but said in early days of the Castro regime attended the University of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 51

# Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez

Havana

Another relative said his primary and secondary education was received in private institutions, and that he has a degree in "political economics" from the University of Havana.

He is well versed in world affairs and has an understanding of international trade.

## PREVIOUS POSITIONS:

Vice Minister, MINCEX, 1964-1967.

Commercial Counselor, Cuban Embassy, Mexico City. Although he was accredited to that position in December 1963, travel indicates he was in Mexico from August 1963 to May 1964. Other references indicate he was in that position in September 1963.

Ministry of the Treasury. In April 1962 he was Chief of the Department of Construction Expenses Studies, Office of Financial Statistics of that ministry. He was with the ministry as early as 1960, when he was selected to attend the statistics course.

During the Batista regime he was in exile. Came to the J.S. sometime in the 1950's and apparently remained for some time before he left in February 1957, when, according to some reports, he entered Cuba clandestinely. Also reported to have been in exile in Mexico.

LNYUMA records show he came to U.S. on 8 November 1956 to see his brother, left 17 November for the Dominican Republic where he received five months military training. Returned to the


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Pérez

## POLITICAL ATTITUDE:

U.S. 5 April 1957, overstayed his time, and on 11 February 1958 was ordered deported; claimed he would be killed if he returned to Cuba and did not show for deportation. Subsequent investigation showed he was in Cuba as of 2 March.

A member of the Cuban Communist Party, admitted on the recommendation of Armando HART Davalos, Secretary of Organization. Although he has been described as a militant Communist, a convinced *supporter of the Castro regime and a fanatic Fidelista*, there is evidence to dispute this image. An analysis of available information indicates that he is not a convinced Marxist, he cannot accept Party discipline, and that his character is basically incompatible with the system he serves.

His father is reported to be an old- guard Communist and a leader of the barber's union. A brother reported to be a member of DSE in 1946.

He expressed dissatisfaction with his position as a diplomat, feels his talents are wasted and would like a position in commerce or industry, where he considers he could better serve the revolution. Has criticized the bureaucracy and inefficiency in the government in Havana.

He has said that many Cuban diplomats want to stay out of Cuba, but it seemed to him that the Cuban government wanted to keep him (RUIZ) out of the way (i.c., outside Cuba). That LEON had appointed him, supported him, and they are good friends, but that he (RUIZ) does not like to work with a man who one does not get to know, nor to know what he is thinking. He said he felt as if he were in Miami.

Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez

INTELLIGENCE
CONNECTIONS:
In Nay 1964 AMMUG-1 reported RUIZ
was a DGI case officer in Mexico for
operations targetted against "some"
nearby area," and later identified
his photograph as DGI member in Mexico.

In 1961 an emigre said RUIZ, with the
Finance Ministry, was a Communist and
G-2.

ANTIKI-1 said a letter from a friend
in Cuba stated that RUIZ, then in
Mexico, was a member of G-2, sent to try
to infiltrate counterrevolutionary
groups (1963).

In April 1968, RUIZ advised Aristides
DIAZ Rovirosa on the use of disguises,
the need to "live secretly" and
commented on DIAZ' being "already
clandestine."

The Cuban Ambassador to Geneva, in
1968, commented on RUIZ' refusal to
accept DGI dominance of the Cuban Embassy,
Madrid. (AMDELAY-1). In July 1969,
AMBEDEW-1 said RUIZ was very dictatorial
in his dealings with DGI officers.

CONTACTS:
Not much is known of his contacts in
Madrid, other than official. Is in
touch with Ahmed LAIDI, Algerian
Ambassador; Manuel TELLO Troncoso,
Counselor of Chilean Embassy, Madrid;
Alexandru PETRESCU, Romanian Minister to
Spain and Carlos CARRASCO Munoz de Vera,
a lawyer and personal friend.

to an approach, with consideration given to
the manner in which it is undertaken, the
timing and the person involved.

ACCESS:

MISCELLANEOUS:

Although RUIZ' health has been described as generally good, he suffers from a back ailment which resulted from a fall in 1955 and which has been diagnosed as incurable. Also he suffers from a liver ailment for which he takes medicine.

RUIZ is scheduled to return to Cuba in mid-1970, where he expects to be with NININT, rather than MINREX or MINCEX.

# Interview with Alexander SANKO.

21 April 1970

1. SAKO was contacted by phone (927-6721) on the morning of 21 April, and he agreed to meet with "Joseph MORRIS, an official of the US government," later the same morning at his home: 1647 Rodman Street, Hollywood, Florida.

2. SANKO accepted my credentials without any reservations. He is a Caucasian male in his 60s. He is of strong build; "white" gray hair; small clear eyes which require thick glasses to read. His most distinguishing feature is a large tatoo on his right forearm. He has a loud booming voice, with a NY accent and although he does not appear to have much of a formal education, he is articulate and sociable. He appears to be retired now and spends his days playing chess with a business associate. He lives in a clean middle class neighborhood and has a Lincoln Continental (about 3 or 4 years old) in the garage.

3. After speaking with him for over half an hour, SANKO does not appear to know Crestes Guillermo RUIZ Peres. SAKKO answered my questions in a straightforward manner and I have no reason to doubt his testimony. Specifically, these are the facts as SAKO related them:

A. The name Crestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez (it was typewritten on a 3 x 5 card) means nothing to him. His business associate -who has worked with him for many years and especially during the 1950s- does not recall the name.

B. SANKO acknowledges that from c. mid 1953 till c. the end of 1959, he owned the "Fruit Center" -a grocery, meat market, and fruit store- on 100 SW 17th Avenue, Miami (one block from Flagler Street). He does not recall that anyone in his employ answered to the name of Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Perez, or any combination of these names. He never had anything but an impersonal employer/employee relationship with his personnel.

C. The last time he had been to Cuba was in c. 1948, "when I went down from New York." He denied several times that he had been to Cuba after Castro took power in 1959.

D. SAKO had bought the "Fruit Center" from a Mr. WOODS, who also owned the property in the vicinity of 100 SW 17th Avenue. SANKO dismissed the personnel WOODS had in the store when he bought. He does not know the whereabouts of WOODS at this time, but presumes he still owns the property.

4. Naturally, SAKO was curious to know why we were after RUIZ. To satisfy his curiosity and perhaps elicit some admission, in the event he was playing games with me, I disclosed those bits of information:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 59

2. 
A. RUIZ had been exiled in the US -from Cuba- in the 1950s. (He was in his mid 20s at the time).

B. We had information that RUIZ had worked for SAMKO in his store as a butcher in the 1950s and that they had established a close personal friendship apart from the normal business relationship.

C. When Castro took power in Cuba (c. 1959), RUIZ had returned to Cuba and there are reports that SAMKO had visited RUIZ in Cuba in 1959. And, further, that SAMKO had offered RUIZ a partnership in his store if RUIZ returned to the US.

D. RUIZ was now the Cuban Minister to Spain and the GOUS was interested in talking to his old friends to see what kind of a person RUIZ was. We had reason to believe that SAMKO was an old friend of RUIZ.

5. SAMKO listened intently. He seemed confused by all these reports. He denied the allegations firmly, but without betraying any sign of nervousness or doubletalk (as when one is telling less than the truth.)

6. SAKKO asked if we had a photo of RUIZ. He said he knew of no other SAMKO in the Miami area, such as a brother, uncle, etc. He did not appear to be bothered or inconvenienced by the allegations, so if he was not telling the truth, he did a wonderful job of it. The only thing he could suggest was to locate Mr. WOODS -the owner before him of the "Fruit Center"- to see if he had RUIZ as an employee.

7. In view of SUKO's statements of denial, there was nothing more to do than to thank him for his cooperation and say good morning.

Henry. S. PACISANKIS.

Perplexed on the pictures on 20 April. I have him short. I told that we were. I added about his days in.

wis playing it cool. That was a possibility since it is
puno di not recognition RUIZ, while everything pointed that there had been a relationship.)

My fears were dispelled when DAMKO had in opportunity in study the photos carefully: "Why, this is William. Do his eyes, but I
would knew him anywhere." There was a friendly, happy smile on his face as he reached back incs his nemzy:

"When I bought the showe, he was already working for the previous
Simos, 10072. He worked for us about 7 or 8 months and then left for Cuba, to fight Batista. There was a weir in his eyes when he said goodbye. I understood that the haul bear killed. I never heard from him again. You say he is a siy shit with Castro. He had high ideals. In my opinion, he was, pro American, although he should have pro Cuban. He love, his country and wanted to liberate. tyranny. He tried to show to the atrocities that

I pointed out on more than one occasion that this was not a
commitment, that an exploratory interview. We were grateful for
his cooperation and would certainly consider him for future
days as a merchant seaman. In the event he is requinted to go
to Spain to pitch RUIZ, SURO understands that he will be paid
only for his personal expenses.

Before parting, I should: SURO came again for his cooperation
and promised to keep in touch with him in the event his services
anytime we want him. You say you want a big ? If it's for the
country, I would be glad to help him.

SUBJECT:
RYBAT/TYPIC/AMAUTO Meeting with 201-866047

1. On 15 April 1970 Stacy B. HARRIOTT had lunch with Subject and Agustin GERVAS who are partners in Taller, S.A. The following is HARRIOTT's report of that meeting:

A. "Subject, and GERVAS have joined with another lawyer, fou ITURRIAGA, to explore joint venture possibilities in Spain. Subject and Iturriaga are law partners with offices in Madrid. An assessment of Subject based on such a short conversation would not normally be of much assistance but since Subject opened up on his thoughts about Cuba, a general recommendation can be reached."

B. "During the lunch I was able to work the conversation around to the business potential for Spanish and U.S. companies in Latin America. Eventually, we touched on Cuba, and Gervas said that Subject considers himself to be an expert in this area as he visited Cuba last year and had a private three-hour interview with Fidel Castro. Gervas said that Subject received a "snow job" from the 'jefe', and this about sets the tone for his feelings for the present Cuban regime. It was not clear how Subject received an invitation to Cuba, but he said that he assisted in obtaining a contract from Cuba for the Pegaso truck company - whether as a representative of this company or in a free-lance capacity."

va's not brought out. It seemed to so that Subject is riding an emotional high for Cuba and Castro. His face lit up and he became relatively excited shon telling us how Castro mixes and talks with "the common people," and is from Spanish parents, and has done so much for the country. I asked him what his goneral impression was of life there and he replied "phenomenal," and I believe he meant it.

C. "Some comments that Subject made would appoar to be inspired by Cuban propaganda or a briefing. He Said that. JKLANCE 18 in control of U.S. internal security and is forcing a rightest swing in its in- ternal politics. Also, all people going to Cuba from Mexico aro photographed by JKLANCE people, while if you go from Spain you don't run this risk."

D. "I asked him if there was good potential for Spanish companies doing business with Cuba. He replied that Cuba is a bridge to Latin America. This secred a strange answer, and I pointed out that you didn't have to go to Cuba to get to Latin America. He said, "that's true, but other countries will change to the Cuban system and will need technicians to assist them. Then ve (Iguess he meant Spanish business men doing business with Cuba) will have excellent possibilities."

E. "Subject said that he knew the Cuban Ambassador to Spain and in fact visited him this morning and re- ceived a large box of Havana cigars from him."

F. "Subject is about 30 years old, good looking and makes an excellent first impression. He appears to have a good business background in addition to being a trained lawyer. He seems aggressive, determined and has a good imagination for business ventures."

G. "It would be premature to say that Subject leans toward Communism or has been had by the Cuban I.S. I doubt that he would have talked to freely about his admiration for Cuba if he is working covertly for them. It is quite certain that he is being used by the Cuban Embassy for commercial purposes, and I would estimate that he would make an excellent "front man" for Cuban business ventures."

H. "I would recommend against trying to recruit Subject as a means of getting to the Cuban Ambassador. He would probably turn down the pitch and inform the Cuban Embassy."

2. The above report is an excellent beginning in cur assess- ment of Subject and HARRIOTT must be commended for his adeptness at steering the conversation toward the relevant areas of interest. We think the report stands alone and requires little commentary by the Station; however, we might add hore that there is a strong probability that Subject was indeed snowed under by the impact of his alleged three-hour talk with Castro. Given Castro's charisza and persuasive qualities it would not be difficult to "convince a young lawyer, alien to the Cuban environment, of the progress in Cuba. Not withstanding HARRIOTT's fine report we feel that Subject is still wallowing in the ebullience of this confrontation with Fidel Castro. His short relationship with the Cuban Pabassy and one visit to Cuba would hardly make nim an authority on Cuba.

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH

3. If you agree we would like to try another attempt to get
   an assessment of Subject. For days we have been trying to devise
   a cover story for a Station officer to use in an approach to Subject.
   We have one and would like your comments, suggestions and ideas. A
   Station officer, preferably in disguise and using an alias, would
   approach Subject as a free lance writer for "World News" (a
   suggestion made by UCAMERA-1 because there are as many stringers
   for "World News" that it would be virtually impossible to confirm)
   with the intention that he is writing an article on Spanish lawyers
   in business with the theme that a degree in law offers greater
   opportunities for advancement in business and government. (The
   theme actually is taken from an article in Fortune or Business Week
   magazine read by the undersigned some years ago). The theme was
   tested on UCAMERA-1 and he agrees that it is a good one and would
   work because of the general nature of Spanish businessmen to like
   to talk about themselves. What is involved however, is a consider-
   able amount of homework, particularly in the collection of names of
   lawyers in business who have been successful. UCAMERA-1 is pre-
   paring a list of such people and we will review them together. The
   undersigned subsequently will ask for Dun and Bradstreet reports on
   the firms these lawyers represent as well as review the firms'
   financial history in our reference aids located in the Embassy's
   commercial library.

4. The theme opens the door to a number of provoking questions,
   but it particularly offers a good opportunity to assess the person-
   ality of the target. Perhaps the opportunity will again come when
   Subject discusses his relationship and knowledge of Cuba at which
   time an interesting exchange might ensue possibly provoking Subject
   to reveal his true relationship with the Cubans and/or his affection
   for the Cuban system. No pitch would be made and, if after this
   assessment, the officer arrives at HARRIOTT's conclusion, the
   Station would recommend against using Subject as an intermediary
   to AMAUTO-1. Advise.

Report No. 2533. 14 April 1970.

Mr. JAVIER, from the Casa Conde of Vigo, calls HORACIO to say that they have had in Vigo for two months the ship VIA JAIBA (ph) for repairs and the captain has decided that it is best if the crew takes its month of vacation now and return later to the ship in Vigo. J adds the captain has to return to Cuba on Friday by CUBANA, but he has no visa and authorization must be requested from the General Department of Security. HORACIO takes down the captain's name: Eugenio LEOPOLDO PORTAL y PEÑA, Passport No. 038-534, issued 12 September 1969, Havana.

Nilda RUIZ calls Alicia FRANCO to instruct her that should someone go by claiming to be a relative of hers to say she has no cousins or relatives of any sort. AF tells her that person went by the Consulate the day before claiming to be her cousin and saying he was a Spaniard. NR contends she cannot imagine where he got that notion because she has no cousins, adding that her cousins are Catalonians and not from Gijón. AF says the man who came to the Consulate saying to be her cousin resembles NR, and describes him as having blue eyes, sort of blond, and tall. She then says it is an older married couple. According to NR, all her family comes from Catalonia. AF repeats this is an older married couple and their problems cannot be solved by the Consulate, rather they must be resolved there (in Cuba?)

for as she says, "It is a boy who also claims to be a relative of youre and wants to come here, but that he has a brother in New York." NILDA says, "That is a bunch of lies..." N wants A to take down the name of that person if he should come back to the Consulate, so that she may find out who they are.

FRANCO talks with ALICIA and says that the case of the *gusano* who killed this wife is being handled by HORÁCIO.

Report No. 2536. 14 April 1970.

Raul GONZALEZ Romero calls ALDO (ph) to ask if VILLA ROYA is there, for he wants to talk with him. He is. ALDO ask the architect comrade how are things going regarding the lots. GR says everything they have seen has been interesting and it is good experience for they can compare and select. He adds that so far the lot on Pasco de la Habana is the best and this is precisely what he wants to tell José Miguel VILLA ROYA.

GONZALEZ ROMERO (to VILLA ROYA): After having seen what we have seen until now and after having checked everything yesterday afternoon--with this man next door--the possibility of resolving at this time the question of the *frontón (pediment)*, we think that the best lot we have seen, and the truth is that we should not let any more time go by because we might lose it, is the one one Paseo de la Habana. That is, the first one

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

7. The Station has refereed or a possible inter- mediary to an eventual approach to AMURO-1. Of all the operations currently active or planned, we believe this operation will be the most commanding on the Station. (See OSNA 20001, 18 March 1970.)

8. We have now pinpointed the home address of the mistress of Subject of 201-110003 and it is now a question of watching her movements. A lack of surveillance capability has placed a burden on Station personnel, but it is expected that a pitch will be made before the end of April, preferably by Perry D. WACHAL prior to his departure.

9. A dispatch was prepared and forwarded asking for Headquarters permission to use AMMIM-1 to make a recruitment pitch to Subject of 201-817309. AMMIM-1 and Subject are former classmates and based on his assessment there might be a good chance to gain Subject's cooperation. (See CSMA 20085, 1 April 1970.)

10. Headquarters Approval was received to mount operation ANCACTUS. QUOQUR-37 will arrange all the details with ANCACTUS-1 and ANCACTUS-3. In an effort to make operation ANCACTUS as broad and flexible as operationally possible, the Station has commented on the use of the ANCACTUS devices in parallel operations. (See CSMA 20105, 6 April 1970.)

11. The FERUMEN Government has approved the construction of a new official installation in Madrid which is expected to be completed within one year. The Station is actively pursuing this matter with the intention to install various audio devices in the new building. There will be a number of barriers to overcome since the IEAURERS appear to want the building constructed by their own team of workers. The Station expects to work closely with QUOQUR in this operation. (See OSA 20040, 18 March 1970 and DIRECTOR 621511, 1 April 1970.)

[This report was developed by a Naval representative assigned to the office of preparation.]

1. Guillermo Lang Laron, a close relative, is the "Cuban Ambassador to Spain" (collateral information dated 12 Can 68 indicates that a Guillermo Bota Isern was the Acting Charge d' Affaires in Spain). Lang has been a Communist since before the days of Castro's regime. I think that he was a member of the old PSP. Just prior to 1959 Bota was operating clandestinely in the Dominican Republic trying to create an overthrow of Trujillo's regime. For Bota Trujillo reportedly wanted him dead, but Bota escaped and returned to Cuba. Castro appointed Ruiz Minister of Foreign Relations sometime during 1959. Ruiz filled this post until 1963 or 1965 at which time he was appointed Ambassador to Spain, a post that he still holds.

2. Bota is a well-educated individual with a degree in political economics from the University of Havana. All his prior schooling, and primary education was conducted in private institutions. Bota is a host of many moods. At times he is amenable, indifferent, cynical, critical, serious, impractical, and cold. Paradoxically, he appears friendly to some people. Regardless, he is a very intelligent and uncommon person.

3. At present he is living at the Cuban Embassy in Madrid, Spain, with his wife and four children. I do not think that he has returned to Cuba since the last trip home in early 1959. He has a brother, Osvaldo Bota Isern, who asked to leave Cuba via Spain and is presently working in the Cuban Embassy.

4. Physical description of Guillermo Bota: Caucasian, age 40, 5'6", 175 lbs, Dean eyes, thin blond hair, wears glasses, and is always impeccably dressed.

TO JOHN SHERACO

FROM WHEELER Would appreciate your comments in turn. Ils return for an en zoter

Notes

1. Now that AUUTC-1 is scheduled to go back to Cuba in mid-year, it is a bit late to begin the recruitment of an intermediary. we have information that he intends to go back to MIHIHT rather than MIHKEX or even HINCK, which makes the likelihood of his coming out again somewhat slimmer to say the least. I'm afraid that, although we have time only for a reasoned quick approach, this type of approach might lose him to us for good.

2. This causing him to become suspicious is not quite what we had in mind when we wrote ref b. o made, I think, a rather strong case for laying cards on the table with ALAUTC-1, and a slow development by a senior staff officer seemed to emerge from the possibilities, he even suggested how it might be done (through the gymnasium). That might be impossible, but the validity of the approach should deserve a comment.

3. An intermediary would be an access agent, so certainly he should be responsive. I can't consider this point to have any additional bearing on the matter. Of course it will be difficult, and ingled they're prepared to work on it.

4. I'd like to have had a chance to review the Sun & Bradstreet file on Carlitos, even tho the PCA has gone forward, CORRECTION: we have it.

5. A joint operation (income ways) is the easy way out. We simply did not get started in time.

6. I disagree, because the question of commitments is somewhat premature, but I'd be willing to puch for 750-1,000 a month while working in place, with a bonus when he does come out. For defection outright, whic: is a poor second, he might even be worth work to resettle him here. IBGA 19006 reported a 1964 attempt to get at Mrs. AMAUTO-L's relatives in Miami, and they might still be there. Fero haps they would sponsor. Everything, but everything depends on initial approaches and debriefings.

7. There are a lot of unanswered questions, posed in the outgoing, and I'd have a preciated a word about them: we have answered this one, we are working in tal manner on that one, etc.

a. The construction work on the new Embassy. There is a separate dispatch on this so all is on wheels.

b. The lonely automobile trips deserves looking into. He comment in the incoming. etc.

In any case, they're on it, so I want to encourage as much as possible.

Pls tube back (80-3) when you're lied a chance to comment

1. There is little we can contribute to the exceptionally fine reports submitted by Headquarters on AMAUTO-1. His character, personality, physical and mental capabilities, and to some extent even his vulnerabilities, are succinctly outlined in your reports. In addition, you have appropriately recognized the Hurculean task we have, to overcome his strong-mindedness and idealistic character.

2. After a series of discussions among the officers involved with PBRUMEN operations at the Station, we have concluded that to execute a logically developed "traditional" recruitment, we are faced with the challenge to recruit a person, an intermediary, in whom AMAUTO-1 has confidence and respect; an individual who is able to plausibly carry on a polemic argument with AMAUTO-1 without either antagonizing him or causing him to become suspicious of the intermediary's true role. Moreover, the intermediary must be intelligent to be able to respond in an appropriate way to our instructions, as well as show a genuine willingness to cooperate. Frankly, we have no such person, currently on our list of assets and to find someone with the attributes set forth in Reference A, will be difficult to say the least, but we are prepared to work diligently on this problem.

3. AMAUTO-1 confides in few people. From our reading
   of QUTINID and QUDOZE, there are at least three persons
   who could logically and effectively fill the role as an
   intermediary. They are Identities A, B, and C. We can
   categorically eliminate Identity A for obvious reasons, i.e.,
   lack of direct access to him. Because of his relationship
   to Identity D, we can also tentatively eliminate Identity B.
   He presents a risk which we are not certain should be taken;
   however, we would like to add a comment on him in a later
   paragraph. Identity C would seem to be the most logical
   choice. He is intelligent, a professional man, well-to-do,
   young and one with whom AMAUTO-1 frequently talks and whom
   he often sees. We know little about his political proclivities
   although he gives the impression of being a moderate analyst
   of world events and doesn't seem to have a strong affection
   or aversion for the PBRUMEN Government. We have a good
   background on him prepared for us by Dun and Bradstreet;
   however, as you can well imagine, the report concentrates on
   the economic side of the individual. We have made a number
   of attempts here in the Embassy to determine whether he has
   any American contacts, but with negative results. His visa
   file does not show where he visited in the United States or
   the purpose, except that it was a business trip. He has an
   indefinite visa and we are fairly certain that, if necessary,
   we could use the question of his visa as an entree to him.
   We are currently reviewing with all Station assets their
   knowledge of Identity C. In addition, we are also considering
   assets such as QUCASH-1 and QUSPOT-1, who could, under some
   legitimate business pretext, contact Identity C. Our objective
   is to develop a warm entree to Identity C without compromising
   any of our agents, but we are in need of an assessment of
   Identity C by either a Station Officer or an asset working
   under an officer's instructions. We will keep you advised of
   our progress. We are forwarding PRQ Part I under separate
   cover. A POA on Identity C was requested separately. There
   are no derogatory Station traces.

4. Identity B would be an excellent choice if not for
   his relationship with Identity D. This avenue might be explored
   with QUSEQUIN-48 if Headquarters is agreeable to a joint
   operation. QUSEQUIN-48 could probably get the necessary
   clearances from Identity D directly, or from one of Identity D's
   aides, to contact Identity B. We will not pursue this until
   we receive your comments.

5. It is not too early to consider the emoluments we
   might want to offer to AMAUTO-1 at the time a pitch is made.
   As always they should be divided into two areas - for defection
   and for recruitment and work in place.

RYBAT TYPIC TECHS/Construction of Now PBRUNEN Dabassy

Reference: OSMA 24774

1.  The PBRUMEN government has approved the construction in Madrid of a new office building to be used as an Embassy, Commercial office and residence for the PBRUMEN Minister. The site has been identified and work is expected to begin soon, probably after the return of AMAUTO-1 from PBRUMEN, sometime within the next two weeks. The builders expect to complete the building within eight months.

2.  QUSEQUIN-37 is far more confident than we are, about the possibility of getting access to the building during the construction phase to possibly install various audio devices. We believe this operation to be a formidable one and we might be challenged by the presence in Madrid of PRRUMEN security forces overseeing the construction, the presence of PBRUMEN electricians and other professions, complicating the access to the building. We believe AMAUTO-1 has the Romanian experience well in mind and most likely will do everything within his power to overcome the possibility of an audio penetration of his building.

3.  We would be grateful for any information addressees might have on the general modus operandi of PBRUMEN security forces in areas where PBRUMEN official installations have been constructed. Have they used PBRUMEN technicians, electricians, construction engineers, etc? Also we would like to know whether the PBRUMENS have installed their own telephone system or have they generally relied on the system of the host country. We would appreciate too, any comments Headquarters or other addressees would like to make on the best course of action for the Station to consider. QUSEQUIN-37 believes he can get a copy of the blueprints after the plan

4. We have made the assumption above that Headquarters desires the Station to pursue this matter,; if not please advise.

1. According to QUTIMID on 26 February, Miss SUAREZ de Cepeda of the Grolier Company called AMAUTO-1 and spoke with his secretary to explain that her company is giving their book to a number of persons in order to obtain their opinions about the product and AMAUTO-1 was one of the persons on Grolier's list. AMAUTO-1's secretary said that he would call when he returned. Later, Miss SUAREZ was told that an appointment was made for 10 March.

2. This would appear to be a routine item which probably would not merit further investigation, unless we can discover someone of higher caliber in the Grolier Company who could approach AMAUTO-1 as a means of cultivating a mean- ingful friendship with AMAUTO-1.

SUBJECT Problems of Cuban Mission in Madrid with Lack of Response from Havana

ACQ Spain, Madrid (2) February 1970) FIELD NO. OSM 9937

SOURCE An official Spanish service from a usually reliable source who was able to read the memorandum reported below.

1. In a memorandum dated 30 January 1970 to Carlos A. Neira Garcia, official of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cuban charge d'affaires in Madrid Guillermo Ruiz Perez outlined the salient current problems of most concern to his mission:

a. Building construction. Ruiz submitted a proposal to Havana in December 1969 for the construction of a building to house all the mission offices including the embassy, the consulate, the commercial office, the Cubana Airlines office, and possibly the minister's residence. Ruiz had not received a concrete reply to the proposal and he urged Neira to take it up again with the ministry.

b. Radio facility. Responding to a request from the Director of the Cuban National Fishing Institute, Emilio Aragones Navarro, in December 1969, Ruiz applied to the Spanish authori- ties for permission to install a radio facility in the Canary Islands for communicating with Cuban ships. The permission had been granted by late December yet Havana had failed to follow up the project with plans and instructions.

c. Visa delays. Havana is consistently late in processing visa requests for foreigners traveling to Cuba. Ruiz attributed the delays to the red tape which involves processing the requests through two ministries; The Visa Section in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Directorate of Immigration in the Ministry of Interior. Ruiz requested authorization for the consulate to send its visa requests directly to the Directorate of Immigration since this is the section that ultimately determines whether a foreigner may or may not enter Cuba.

TYPIC/QUTIMID/U.S. Company in Touch with Cuban Embassy, Madrid

1.  QUTIMID reported a 21 January 1970 conversation held between the wife of the Cuban Charge in Madrid and a Miss "Lourdes" speaking for the Grolier Company in New York. Miss Lourdes said that her company was undertaking some type of publicity and wished to interview the Charge in this regard. When questioned about what kind of work the company does, Miss Lourdes replied that Grolier is an investigation (studies) and consultant firm with central office located in New York City. Lourdes gave her local number as 233-7448. She was advised that the matter would be brought up to the Charge, Guillermo RUIZ, and she would be informed of the results later.

2.  Later that day Aristides DIAZ Ruvirosa, the Embassy's press officer and a member of the DGI, called back to say that he would see her the next day in his office at 10:30.

3.  According to QUSEQUIN, telephone 233-7448 is registered in the name of Isaac BENDAHAN Sananes at Calle General Moscardo 8, 6th floor, Apt. C, Madrid. There are no Station or liaison traces on BENDAHAN.

4.  DO Base New York may be able to identify the Grolier Company in New York and the reason for which their representative was in touch with the Cuban Embassy.

5.  Whatever follow-up action is conducted, the sensitivity of the QUTIMID operation should be kept firmly in mind so that our interest does not appear to stem froa a technical monitoring of the Cuban installation.

Report No. 259 (Cont'd). 27 JAN 1970

I told her that I personally regretted it, as an individual and as Cuban, but that as a diplomat I could not do her any favor because she had left Cuba voluntarily, in flight, and that I could not render any assistance to her and least of all protect her. If I had then been able to take pictures, I could have sent them to Havana for them to see (This happened when RUIZ had first arrived here.)

RUIZ goes on to say that many people are misled when they arrive in Madrid from Cuba, or have been misled by their relatives. Parents bring their children--RUIZ says there are over 400 Cuban children in one school. One of them left school once and passage had to be provided for him at the airport in CUBANA and allowed him to leave because they did not want to be mixed up in that affair. The child was 14 years old and did not want to stay in Madrid in the parrochial school with the monks. R says that should anything happen to him and his wife wants to stay in Madrid, he wants his children to return to Cuba and remain there until they become of age and make their own choice, but that to take children out of Cuba is a mistake.

NILDA is typing while RUIZ is out of the office. CURBELO comes in and she tells him a cable arrived granting her permission to travel to Havana, but that she will not be going because RUIZ became annoyed. She adds that RUIZ is very selfish.

NILDA and RUIZ discuss her trip. R asks her if she is going; she says 'no' because he does not want her to go. Apparently he tells her to go home that instant and get ready, after she tells him that she has no time to take out her summer clothes, etc. She declines by saying that he has already ruined everything. She goes on to say that she had not asked MELVA or anyone else for her passage, but had written to RUZ (ph) saying that she was very depressed and that she missed her son very much, and they had arranged for her passage. NILDA adds that she is not going on a pleasure trip, but to see her son and see how he is doing, which she finds only natural. She would have stayed with him for two whole days and would have talked to the School Director and formdout how the child was doing. She calls R selfish and says if the trip had been for him she would not have doubted it. She wants to know why RUIZ places objections to her trip to Havana. He want's the two of them to go together, and for her to wait until their vacation, not at this time. She

other such things. This amount could be reduced if we bring
our Cuban architects, who were here two years ago, and
knowledgeable of their mission could discuss with the
land owner and the construction firm those things they
feel could be omitted and the price could be brought dom
considerably. We do not need a luxury building, but one
that is attractive, simple and functional. Term payments
could also be extended. I want to impress upon you that
when we entered into negotiations we had a binding
agreement.

"The lot is on Avenida La Habana, Fermín GUTIERREZ
looked well into this matter. He asked me to send
him the project and that he would look at it. The
system of payments in Spain allows us to pay $100,000
or $150,000 annually which will not be difficult for
us.

"NEIRA, I want you to talk to CHAIN, not bearing
pressure on him, but to make him understand that what
I want is to leave my successor established, for any
construction lasting over nine months I certainly
will not be able to enjoy."

"Another thing I want to bring to your attention is
in regard to our Consulate, its activities and relations

There is another unidentified Cuban in the office. When RUIZ is left alone with her, he says that he feels like an exile, that he has been out for two years and is tired. There are many who want to be out of Cuba, he continues, but it seems to him they want to keep him out of the way. He goes on to say that LEON had appointed him, and supported him, but although they are good friends, he does not like to work with a man whom one never knows what he is thinking, and one never gets to know. R mentions a cable he had sent and says it could have cost his assassination, and that he had purposely done so to see if he were summoned to discuss the matter in Cuba. He would have liked to discuss it there, but they have apparently remained silent. R laments he feels as if he were in Miami.

to see about a package that Melba had lost traveling from
Cuba the week before and could not locate because she had
lost the ticket.

One Miss LOURDES calls on behalf of the Grolier Company
from New York and tells NILDA they are conducting some
type of publicity and would like to arrange an interview
with Guillermo RUIZ. NILDA asks what type of company
it is. She is told it combines study and research.
N notes down the following information for RUIZ to call
when he gets in: Grolier Company of Study and Research,
main office in New York, Miss LOURDES, tel.: 233-74-48.

SANTAMARIA, from the Ministry of Commerce, calls in answer
to R's call and to apologize for not having been able to 'attend
the reception. R begins by saying that when Raúl LEON
had left for Cuba he had sent a letter of thanks to the
Minister (of Commerce) for his kind considerations and at
the same time had mentioned that "before your [pl.7 trip
it would be most beneficial and advisable for both parties
if you [pl.7 could advance us a list of subjects you are
interested in discussing in Havana, for it would at least
give us a little time to prepare ourselves." SANTAMARIA
says, "Precisely, on Friday at 10:30 I am having a

Mrs. Concepción CAMACHO de MATOS calls RUIZ. NILDA asks if she is the same person who called the other day and said she was the widow of... (MATOS). The woman says 'yes' and NILDA tells her: "Look Miss, you're playing a very dangerous game."

MATOS: I don't know what you mean, miss.

NILDA: Well, because none of the comrades here is going to allow himself to be provoked. So, please do not keep on."

MATOS: Well, I don't know what you are referring to, miss, I am completely astonished.

NILDA: Well look, don't be astonished, you might end up some other way.

MATOS: I don't know what you are talking about.

NILDA: Well, we do.

NILDA hangs up.

Mrs. MATOS calls the Ambassador's secretary again; it seems there has been a misunderstanding.

NILDA: Look miss, we do not wish to talk to you anymore. We are telling you in a nice way. Please do not call anymore.

MATOS: I am not going to call again... I only want to say I had nothing to do... I know nothing at all.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 122

... Only that I have received a message. I received a telephone call... I have just arrived in Madrid, I am not familiar with Madrid, or know anyone.

NILDA: Aren't you the one who called the other day? You made a date.

MATOS: What kind of a date?

NILDA: Didn't you make a date with the Charge d'Affaires?

MATOS: No, no, no. One moment, miss. I received a telephone call and was told to call this gentleman, the Cuban Ambassador. I could also tell you about another ambassador, but that they were trying to get in touch with me.

NILDA: Who are 'they'? To whom do you refer when you say that 'they' called you?

MATOS: I was called on behalf of the Ambassador of Chile and the Ambassador of Cuba. I thought it was extremely unusual, miss, because I don't know anyone here.

NILDA: Didn't you call here a few days ago?

MATOS: I called when I was advised to do so.

NILDA: And you made a date with the Ambassador.

MATOS: I don't know now what exactly did happen. I was asked to talk with him and to get in touch with him, miss.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 123

- 20 -

NILDA: Eut, who called you, miss?

MATOS: Whoever it was said "I am the Cuban Ambassador," so then it all seems to have been a plot, or something of the sort.

NILDA: Look, if it is a plot I suggest you do not get involved because where we are concerned it is somewhat dangerous.

MATOS: No miss, I am very proper and a serious person.

NILDA: Since you are so serious and proper don't ever let anything happen to you.

MATOS: I live with a daughter and you must realize that I live only for her.

NILDA: Well, look, if you live for her, don't get mixed up in these things for they may cost you dearly.

MATOS: Very well, miss. I am deeply grateful to have been enlightened by you. I can see already that it is simply a plot or an implication by someone.

NILDA: It is a plot and we know it. And we know who is behind it.

Ruiz says he is very anxious to move out of the place he is in, and aks how long it will take to construct the building. Villaroya tells him about 9 or 10 months.

Guillermo RUIZ Pérez

DOB: Late January or early February 1930.
POST: Minister Plenipotentiary, accredited since 12 December 1967.
ADDRESS: Juan de Mena #8, Madrid.
TELEPHONES: 259-5956 (home), 221-7028 (office).

DOI: March 1970.

WIFE: Nilda VECIANA. Probably in her early thirties, she is pregnant and was due to have her sixth child in May 1970. However, her physician recommended forced labor (reasons unknown), which was scheduled for 17 April 1970. She has had difficulties with her pregnancy because of recurring fainting spells and overweight, which are being treated by Dr. HER- NANDEZ and Dr. MATA (the latter ordered lab tests for Diabetes, the results of which are unknown).

Married for 16 years to Guillermo, Nilda is a pleasant woman who has not been known to quarrel openly with her husband or express political or religious opinions, although in this last respect she has recited the Lord's Prayer in front of Embassy personnel, which suggests that she may have been or is a practicing Catholic.

Mrs. Ruiz is a language teacher by profession (speaks English fluently), and is active in the Embassy as secretary to her husband and book- keeper, but only on an informal basis.

Of rather weak personality / Exception, see Attachment II; she was upset at the time_7, which is reflected in the way that she handles her five boys--"little beasts, ", according to Severina ORTIZ, the maid--, Mrs. Ruiz does not permit them to be punished severely and is always complaining that she does not spend sufficient time with them.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 134

She is known to have lived in New York for five years in the fifties (on 48th St., three blocks from Times Square), a city that she likes very much. She goes shopping alone, and once even to the airport in a taxi (Juan Antonio CURBELO, the embassy security officer, did not like the idea) to wait for her husband's arrival from one of his trips. She seems to get along well with the wives of other Cubans in the staff.

Nilda travelled to Havana on 30 January 1970 to see her son Guillermito, and returned to Madrid on 11 February. Although RUIZ used her to send a lengthy memo to Carlos NEIRA, his superior at MINREX [for text see Attachment III], he was not very happy with her trip- an attitude that Nilda resented very much ("You are very selfish") until her husband changed his mind.

Her parents live in Havana ( local telephone, 2-8130). [Cuban Telephone Directory lists that telephone number under Y. LAM, Calle 21 #3421, Mariano.

CHILDREN:

1.- Guillermito ("Guille"). At 14 he is the oldest and is currently studying in Havana. He is very tall and thin. There were reports that he was unhappy in Cuba, and his father went to Havana on 16 October 1969 to solve a "personal problem" with Guillermito. If true, Guille no longer feels that way because on 26 December he was quoted to be very happy in his new school.

Guille was scheduled to cut cane after 10 January 1970, but was actually assigned to a tobacco farm in Guane early this year.

2.- Alejandro, who is nine years old (DOB: 15 Feb). According to those who know him he is a real "devil" and a good swimmer. He is taking guitar lessons, and goes to Colegio

Estilo and Gimnasio Mascardo, Pilar de Zaragoza
#99, Madrid.

3.- Ivan, who is about eight years old.

4.- Juan Carlos. -

5.- Juliote.

All five are very spoiled and have caused
several maids to leave their jobs. Severina
ORTIZ bitterly complains that they show no
respect for their parents. This is why she
"hates" Mrs. Ruiz. There was another maid,
Ana María, who was replaced because she did
not look after the children.[^1] Ana María is
currently employed by the wife of Aristides
DIAZ, who is leaving Spain definitively in August
1970.[^2]

BACKGROUND: Guillermo RUIZ, familiarly known
as El Guajiro, probably comes from a humble
family in Cuba, as he lived in a solar[^3] in
Cuba, a slum dwelling[^4] in Marianao and began
to work when he was only 14 years old.

In the fifties he emigrated to the United
States, travelling throughout the East Coast
and holding minor jobs. In 1957 he began to
work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-
American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a
grocery store on Flagler St. in Miami. He
did so well in attracting Latin-American customers
to the store that he soon began to distribute
meat in the area for SAMKO.

He has said that when he left Miami
in 1958 he turned over to his brother a house
in North Miami, a brand new car, and over a
thousand dollars in the bank.

But his "success" could be traced, perhaps,
to another acquaintance that he is known to
have had.

At the time RUIZ and Major José María MOLEON 7201-2976601
Carreras, then another Cuban exile, were in contact
with an American of Cuban descent known as Joe LOUIS
or LUIS, an underworld figure who was competing
with the Italians in the bolita racket in Tampa.
RUIZ himself has told close associates that LUIS
or LOUIS offered them $800 a month, plus car and
expenses, to supervise "collections" in Miami.

Furthermore, LOUIS or LUIS even asked them
to kill a man named FERNANDEZ, who was involved
in the numbers game in Miami, for $5000 each.

In February 1958 RUIZ left Miami with Harry
VILLEGAS Tamayo I a Captain in the Cuban Army,
he has been seen at parties in foreign embassies
in Havana with Major Manuel PIÑEIRO Losada, DGI
chief 7 and three other members of the 26th of
July Movement and entered Cuba clandestinely.

At the triumph of the Revolution Alexander
SAMKO went to Havana, where he stayed for a
week at RUIZ's home, and offered him a partner-
ship in the business, which RUIZ rejected.

In 1960 he was one of 18 out of 5000 who
were selected by the Ministry of the Treasury,
where he was working, to take the full statistics
course outlined by ECLA. The course, which lasted
two years, included such subjects as mathematics,
finances, democracy...and Marxism-Leninism.

One of his schoolmates at the time was
Marta ARCOL, now director of the Art Museum of
Havana.

In 1963 he was sent to Mexico, and after
returning to Havana was appointed Chief of the
Trade School at MINCEX, post that he held for
two years.

In 1967 he was sent to Spain to replace
Ramón CALZADILLA as charge d'affaires.

EDUCATION: Aside from the statistics course
taken in 1960, RUIZ seems to lack, in the eyes
of some observers, a solid, formal education.
But he makes up for it by being an avid reader
(five newspapers a day, plus books). This impression,
however, may be wrong, for there are indications
that he either studied or wanted to be a CPA.

He understands and speaks English and
French (fluency unknown), and has undertaken
to teach grammar to the embassy staff.

Sensitive to art, or so he says, he
frequently complains of the general lack of
culture in Cuba. His vocabulary level is rather
low, cussing quite often in the presence of
others.

RUIZ is well-versed in world affairs,
and does have an understanding of international
trade.

He has read some of the works of José Martí,
whom he likes to quote. But there is another
book that he also refers to repeatedly, Kim PHILBY's,
the KGB spy who penetrated MI-6.

He is up-to-date on current intelligence
publications.

HEALTH: Blond, baby-faced, and blue-eyed ("Very
handsome," according to Anita, the young maid),
RUIZ is known to be suffering from an undisclosed
liver illness for which he takes a medicine called
`bilidis`. Late in 1969 he was planning to go to
Portugal on vacation following the advice of his
physician, Dr. Pedro CABAS (telephones, 276-7746,
256-2294), but he did not make the trip. He coughs
frequently, is used to cold weather, and was thinking
of going to the same gymnasium as his son Alejandro.

He wears eyeglasses to correct astigmatism, and is known to like skin-diving, a sport that he practiced in Cuba.

In general terms, however, he enjoys good health.

EMPLOYMENT: There is no doubt that Guillermo RUIZ exercises the full authority that presumably he should have as Minister Plenipotentiary (relations between Cuba and Spain remain at this level because of Spain's refusal to appoint a full Ambassador after LOJENDIO was expelled from the Island by Fidel CASTRO).

He is involved in and kept informed of all matters that have to do with Cuban-Spanish relations, including trade. He does not permit commercial attachés to bypass him when they submit reports to their respective enterprises in Havana.

In addition, he supervises Cubana Air Lines operations, and no one may travel on Iberia to Havana without his permission (this applies only to Cubans, for tickets must be paid in foreign currency). Evidently he controls_ the Cuban Embassy in Lisbon, and Rafael FERNANDEZ Sardiñas, the *chargé* there, travels frequently to Madrid for consultations with RUIZ ( "Our relations with Portugal are not very good now").

Cuban officials arriving in Madrid must consult with him before arranging visits to Spanish officials or factories, and only he, Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemes, Aristides DIAZ Rovirosa, and Roberto FRANCO Oliva, are authorized to issue visas for people travelling to Cuba.

He seems to have good working relations with Spanish Government officials because he is always careful to place all the "cards" on the table in his meetings with them.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 139

Nothing is known about unofficial contacts with other diplomats in Madrid except that he is close to and exchanges information with the Algerian Ambassador.

At times he tries to give the impression, and this might be true, that he enjoys the full personal confidence of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Raúl ROA.

He frequently tells other Cuban diplomats stopping in Madrid that he makes 90% of the decisions without consulting Havana because that is "why I am here for."

Above all, he directs constant and bitter criticism against the bureaucracy in Havana because of its incompetence, which, in his opinion, will cause Fidel CASTRO to carry out a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest comes to an end ("No one in Havana wants or cares to make a decision").

The Peter Frinciple [^1] In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence", which he has read and is going to send to Fidel CASTRO for reading on the advice of Melba HERNANDEZ, should be taken as an example of what is happening in Cuba. Furthermore, in his view Havana is always trying to interfere with the Embassy in Madrid, resulting in lack of co-ordination and even co- operation. (To Horacio FUENTES Martínez: " More than lack of organization there is chaos in Cuba today.")

He directs almost the same criticism against his staff in Madrid because they lack qualifications for the posts that they hold. They think that I am a fool," he once told an associate, "but I don't miss anything that they do."

In turn, he has also been the target of criticism from Havana, first from Sonia GOMEZ, who made a critical evaluation of the Embassy, which he decided not to answer ("I took a librium, smoked a cigar, and forgot all about it").

[^7] Sonia GOMEZ, a MINREX inspector close to Vice-Minister Carlos CHAIN, was in Madrid in mid-February 1970 for another review of embassy accomplishments. But this time she seemed friendly with Guillermo RUIZ.[^7]

On another occasion he complained to Aristides DIAZ that he had received one more critical report from Havana because the Embassy "had not achieved much," although they had done things that were not included in the yearly plan.

But perhaps the most serious censure of his activities came in by telex (" Why worry? The Americans and the Spaniards intercept all messages anyway") early in October 1969. Havana questioned the way RUIZ was handling trade negotiations with the Spanish Government. [^7] The trade agreement was extended by mutual consent to 31 December 1972.[^7]

In his reply addressed to Raúl LEON Torras, first vice-minister of MINCEX and senior Cuban official directly responsible for the talks, Guillermo RUIZ defended his right to be "informed" and "consulted" in rather strong language. Therefore, he rejected that his cable number 521 was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ, a Cuban trade official who had been the source of the complaint.

In the last paragraph he told Raúl LEON that the indemnification question (payment to Spanish citizens who owned property in Cuba) depended on his reply to Don Pedro SALVADOR, a Spanish Foreign Office official, and not on "bribery" conjectures.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 141

SECRET

- 9 -

Evidently this last cable upset him so much that he was nervous and particularly security-conscious. Less than a week later, he called Raúl LEON Torras and requested permission to go to Cuba, ostensively to settle a "personal problem with my son."

When he returned to Madrid on 29 October he was a changed man, again fully confident of himself. Nevertheless, he has told close friends that he feels very lonely in Spain and has had the desire to simply board a plane and return to Cuba abandoning the Embassy.

Late in January 1970 he was again depressed, for he felt like an "exile" in Spain after two years of service ( " Even though LEON played a part in my appointment I cannot work for a man that I do not under- stand. Maybe he sent me abroad to get me out of the way. I feel as if I were in Miami.")

He thinks he is "burned" in Spain, and when he returns to the Island he will definitely not go back to MINREX, but to MININT. He has told close friends his term in Spain is up and he will be returning to Cuba probably in the summer. In any event, he does not plan to be in Spain more than nine months. Nilda, his wife, has stressed that they are leaving Madrid permanently in July 1970.

POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL VIEWS: Although outwardly a "revolutionary", Guillermo RUIZ is a man of moderate political views struggling to justify the actions of his government in face of the political and economic realities of Castro's Cuba.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 142

# SECRET

- 10 -

In this sense his inner feelings perhaps lie closer to the theory of the *betraved revolution*, but not for ideological reagons: the incompetence of the Cuban Government has in fact sabotaged the goals of the Revolation.

A member of the Cuban Communist Party, to which he was admitted on the recommendation of Armando HART Dávalos, secretary of Organization, he is definitely not a convinced Marxist, and consequently cannot accept the role of "robot" required by Party discipline and vertical structure (" Revolutionaries should not be coerced by political control forms," he wrote Telesforo DIAZ Portillo, a MINPEX official, on 26 December 1969. "Communists are quite meddlesome," he told another colleague soon after, although in this instance he may have been referring to the Spanish CP).

But the most important revelation of his views came to light on 11 December 1969, when he was quoted as telling a visiting DAP official from Havana: *"If I disagree with orders, I question them because I am not a robot nor do I have the mentality of one. As a human being I express opinions no matter the risk that I may personally have to take."*

Obviously, a man who thinks in this way cannot be a Marxist,

Aside from the constant criticism of Havana because of incompetence, lack of vision, and the unreal world they live in, he is quick to point out other deficiencies in life there, as reflected in his directive to the embassy staff not to celebrate Christmas together because there are "hungry people" in Cuba. But he did invite some of his associates for dinner

on Christmas eve, the classical Spanish Nochebuena. He has also said that medicine in general is quite backwards in Cuba.

Probably an atheist, he is known to believe that "religion should not be considered a handicap for people trying to return to Cuba."

On the other hand, he refers to Latin-American diplomats as "bootlickers" because they use the English language in parties, and has remarked that "capitalism is no good".

RUIZ seems to have certain admiration for Francisco FRANCO, who, in his view, is the only reason why Spain has not turned communist. Of course, it is doubtful that he really believes this.

He does not hide his favorable opinions of the American people, who are "frank" and "simple". They treated me very well," he told Raúl LEON Torras in December 1969.

On international matters he is up-to-date and well-informed. Following are some of his views, which are contradictory at times:

"Cuba is a political power, not a military or economic power.

"The USSR has neutralized U.S. sea power in the Mediterranean.

" Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever it chooses to do so, although the base has lost its strategic value to the United States.

"US-China rapproachment should be feared, but also a Japan-China alliance.

"U.S. power is beginning to crumble, but the Soviets are revisionists."

"The Egyptians harm us when they buy sugar from Cuba and then resell it to other countries."

"We have to be on the side of the Soviets for two reasons: first from the military and economic point of view; secondly, because whether right or wrong they are on the same side fighting those who are on the other side."

"Cuba has had and has major discrepancies with the USSR, China, and the U.S., but we are on the side of communism because we are against capitalism."

"Israel and Cuba have the same motivations. That is why they are so successful against the Arabs. They have no choice."

"The Egyptians and the Syrians are not brave. The Israelites, like the Cubans, are brave enough to face the enemy."

PERSONALITY: Guillermo RUIZ is an easy-going rather simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige and success that he has had in Spain.

He has a strong personality, undoubtedly the predominant pole in his marriage. He seems to get along well with his wife. (" If anything should happen to me and my wife wants to remain in Spain, I want my children to go back to Cuba to study. Then they can decide for themselves what they want to do.")

Certain degree of racism can be detected in his speech, for he always refers to Negroes as *niches*, a contemptuous Cuban expression.

He almost never discusses women with colleagues, nor is he known to be involved in any extramarital affair.

Possible exceptions: Vera VORODOWSKI, his secretary now in Cuba. There were rumors that RUIZ was the beneficiary of Vera's affection. There is also a young Spanish girl named JIMENA (Inu), who addresses RUIZ in the familiar *tu*. She lives in the house of Carmen LABRA or LABRADA.[^7]

He likes to go to the movies (saw *Topaz*; no comments), and receive people at his home for cocktails.

SECURITY: It is normal for any member of the Cuban Foreign Service to exercise certain discretion in the area of security, but Guillermo RUIZ is particularly sensitive in this respect, which perhaps could be traced to his probable involvement with the DGI in one way or another.

He is quick to warn visiting Cubans of the CIA's efforts ("La Compañía Sociedad Anónima") to compromise them, even before leaving Havana. "Our Embassy," he says, "is the primary target for U.S. operations in Spain."

He keeps control of mail going to and coming from Havana in the diplomatic pouch, and states repeatedly that his office is bugged and telephone tapped ("There are microphones here the size of olives"). In addition, he thinks he is followed openly by *Seguridad*.

For all these reasons he has asked Havana for funds to build a new embassy, where he plans to have a shielded room free from microphones. (The building, which will cost approximately $600.000, was approved by Havana and a Cuban architect travelled to Madrid in late March 1970 to discuss the project with Sr. VILLARROYA, from Construcciones Azagra, who is handling the real-estate operation. Villarroya's telephone number is 254 4238.)

He is particularly aware of what he calls "traps", and in this sense recalls that once he was asked to dinner by the wife of a VIP, and after accepting the invitation he was told that someone else and a priest would attend too. Even though the lady in question was very upset, he did not go because one of those present could have been a "seditionist" ready to be "arrested" by the police. An inevitable scandal would have followed. He adds that he receives visits in the Embassy because there he admits only those that he wants to see..

An interesting item is the case of Conchita CAMACHO (telephone 201 4989), who called RUIZ at the Embassy claiming to have met him at a party and wanting to see him, alone, at the Hilton for a "chat". ( See Attachments I and II.7

Perfectly aware of the implications and seemingly in violation of his own rules, he did go to the hotel after ordering Horacio FUENTES to check the telephone number ("The CIA has a new agent"), in spite of the fact that Raúl LEON Torras was arriving in Madrid on that night.

He and Fernando, his driver, waited outside until the woman left the hotel with some men. RUIZ wanted only, so he says, to warn her not to get involved in matters between Cubans because she could "lose her life".

Regarding communications, Guillermo RUIZ has even suggested installing a radio transmitter and speaking in code with Havana. / The Cubans are in fact installing a radio transmitter on Islas Canarias to communicate with their fishing fleet. But RUIZ, in this particular case, has

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

## SECRET

- 15 -

stressed to the Spanish Government that Cuba is willing to permit Spanish citizens to operate the station, thereby avoiding any suspicion that the transmitter will be used for other purposes.[^1]

In spite of his security-consciousness, he himself is the target of certain control by Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemus, the "cultural" first secretary who in reality is the security man at the Embassy (RUIZ has complained that he needs a "real" one in Madrid: "Sergio / DEL VALLE, minister of the Interior / told me they were getting someone ready to send as cultural attaché" ), for CURBELO instructed the front-desk girl to pass on to him a summary of who sees who and for what, including RUIZ's visitors.

RUIZ likes to recall the time when a Cuban in his staff ( name unknown, but presumably he is back in Cuba) spread the rumor that RUIZ and Nilda were not well-liked in Havana, perhaps to undermine his authority. CURBELO reprimanded the man by stressing that "when Havana is doubtful of anybody here in Madrid it uses official channels to let us know."

Nevertheless, he does make mistakes, as evidenced by discussing in his office, with members of his staff, the possibility of advising Havana that a Spanish foreign service officer scheduled for duty there might be open for recruitment. Recalling his constant warnings that his office is bugged by Seguridad, such discussion clearly exposes him to expulsion from Spain.

By the same token, he likes to travel by car to the interior of the country alone ( he must have powerful reasons to do so, for

he is risking attack by Cuban exiles, a possibility
that he surely must not discard given the
reception that they gave Armando HART Dávalos,
Carlos CHAIN, and Carlos ALFARAS at Barajas
Airport on 30 June 1968). Neither his wife
nor CURBELO approve of this.

At times he is known to write on paper
key phrases or names when discussing confidential
matters in his office, or to speak very low.
Furthermore, he says he goes to Parque del Retiro
when he wants to discuss sensitive matters with
anybody.

In short, he is security-conscious, very
shrewd, and suspicious of anybody that comes
near him.

TRAVEL: Following are the trips that Guillermo
EUIZ made from October 1969 to February 1970:

To Havana to settle a "personal problem"
on 20 October 1969 by *Iberia* (first class),
returning to Madrid on 29 October.

To London on 14 November 1969 for consultations
with Raúl LEON Torras, returning two days later
by air (also first class).

To Bilbao, San Sebastian, and Burgos, by
car, on 28 November 1969, returning two days
later.

To Italy from Barcelona with his wife and
two children on 29 December 1969. He went to
pick up an *Alfa Romeo*, which he paid out of his
own funds. They returned through Florence, Genoa,
San Remo, and Barcelona, arriving in Madrid on
6 January 1970.

SECRET

To Burgos by car with REGALADO (fnu) and URQUIZA (fnu) on 24 January 1970.

To Havana on 20 February 1970. He was scheduled to participate in trade negotiations with the Spanish delegation that left Madrid on 22 February 1970. RUIZ returned to Madrid on 24 March 1970.

FRIENDS: Not much is known about Guillermo RUIZ's personal acquaintances, except for the following:

Pedro RUIZ. A good friend who goes to his home rather frequently, Pedro is quite influential according to Guillermo. He is also a friend of MASSO (fnu).

Carlos or Enrique CARRASCO. He is a partner of Carrasco, Muñoz e Iturriaga, with offices at Avenida Generalisimo #28, 10th floor. RUIZ meets with him often, either for lunch or at his home. They seem to be good personal friends. CARRASCO may have to do with arrangements for the sale of Cuban frozen seafood. Travelled to New York late in October or early November 1969. RUIZ is known to have visited CARRASCO's office.

Rosendo CANTO.- Lives at Goya #54, Madrid. His friendship with RUIZ may be interesting if he is the same Rosendo Canto who was a well-known batistiano (probably his father). If this is the case contacts with RUIZ are politically dangerous for the latter, unless he is using CANTO with the approval of Havana. According to Roberto FRANCO Oliva, the consul, CANTO wanted to go to Cuba, live there for a year, and then join the Cuban Foreign Service ("He is a fool," RUIZ). CANTO's father is ill in Cuba

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 150

and sends him mail through the Cuban diplomatic pouch. CANTO is involved with the diplomatic representation of Equatorial Guinea.

Armando FERNANDEZ.- "A good friend," says RUIZ. But he has doubts about FERNANDEZ's source of income ("Maybe he gets money directly from Havana without my knowledge"). FERNANDEZ sends a "lot of things" to Cuba. He is an artist, and lives at Bondad #1 (telephone, 255-3281). Armando claims to know Fidel CASTRO and Celia SANCHEZ personally. It may be true, for he received a package at the embassy from the latter in March 1970. However, he asked the Cuban staff to send it to him because he "did not want to be seen taking something out of the embassy." FERNANDEZ's father has cancer.

JIMENEZ Asenjo, deputy director of the Spanish Dirección General de Seguridad. Knows RUIZ personally, and is in contact with him rather often, but presumably in the line of duty.

SUMMARY: Guillermo RUIZ is a very shrewd, articulate individual who has reached heights that in all probability would have been beyond his capability in normal circumstances.

Nevertheless, from what can be seen his work in Spain has been effective, and he keeps a tight control over his staff. He is a man confident of himself and of the backing Armando HART Davalos ? 7 that he surely must have in order to remain in this sensitive post of the Cuban foreign service.

Precisely because of his privileged status RUIZ is very careful in whatever he does, avoiding mistakes that would endanger his position.

Therefore, he will probably resist any indirect approach, which he will recognize in time to brush it off.

But this does not mean that he is unapproachable, for he is not. There is no question that his personality is incompatible with the system that he serves, although with profound misgivings as to its efficiency. It is then a question of how and when.

The very fact that he has made open remarks suggesting his unhappiness with Havana and his non-Marxist leanings in an office "bugged by the other side," as he points out, could be interpreted as a signal on his part indicating that he is ready to listen.

But he will be suspicious of an indirect or subtle approach, which, in his view, could be a trap to compromise him, including a loyalty test by the DGI.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

SECRET

- 20 -

Consequently, a direct approach has much better chance of success. It would be proof for him that he is walking on firm ground by dealing directly with Americans. Which leads to the question of when. There are two key factors to consider :

a) His recall to Cuba.

b) The 10-million ton sugar harvest, which is scheduled to end on 15 July 1970.

RUIZ has indicated that he is unhappy in his post--perhaps not really meaning what he says--, which he has occupied for over two years.

As he has said that Fidel CASTRO plans a major purge after the 1970 sugar harvest, he himself may be one of the targets. Assuming that his ideological inconsistencies have been noticed, the DGI, in the absence of proof regarding his loyalty and considering whatever support he has in Havana, may request his recall at an appropriate opportunity: during a major reorganization of the Cuban Government.

In any event, RUIZ does not expect to remain in Madrid much longer, and is planning to be back in Havana by the 18th of July.

If Cuba is successful in harvesting 10 million tons of sugar, and they have already reached six, the "victory" that Cuban propagandists will herald from July on may have a psychological impact on RUIZ's thought. He will be less inclined to defect, in place or otherwise, at such time.

SECRET

Finally, if RUIZ's personality were to be summarized in one word, that word would be realist with a logical mind. Above all, this is what RUIZ is.

Report No. 2274. 9 January 1970.

One 'Miss' CONCHITA calls asking for RUIZ. NILDA says she is his secretary and CONCHITA may leave the message with her. C would like to surprise him. NILDA asks for her last name; C does not give it to her because it would then fail to be a surprise, but leaves her telephone number (201-49-69) for R to call her after 8, for she works until that time. On NILDA's insistence C gives her last name as CAMACHO, adding she is the widow of the doctor who was director of the Coimbra Hospital.

RUIZ calls Mrs. CAMACHO at 201-49-69. She begins the conversation by saying they had met at a party which she had attended with her husband at the Dominican Embassy in Madrid. She reminds him that they had talked with the Paraguayan Ambassador and former Dominican Ambassador Rafael COMPRES, and that the party had taken place two years ago. Despite all the details RUIZ insists he does not remember her and asks how he can be of service to her. She tells him "I have just arrived and find myself somewhat isolated, disoriented, and I must find work. I recall you telling me on that ocassion 'If you should ever have any problem and you come to Madrid, look me up.' One other ambassador also offered me his assistance and I have tried to locate both of you." Mrs. C mentions having a daughter, that her husband was a pilot and that she is a Spaniard, adding she is not too old. R replies that in all honesty he does not remember her. She insists on seeing him to have a chat, and R suggests she come to his office at her convenience. She prefers talking with him alone, without his secretary or anyone else present, and suggests a bar at some hotel like the Palace, Ritz or Hilton. He is agreeable to any place she may desire; they agree to meet that night at 9:30 in the lobby of the Hilton Hotel. She will be dressed all in black."

RUIZ calls FERNANDO P is to meet R outside the latter's home about 9 o'clock dressed in coat and tie.

Mrs. Concepción CAMACHO de MATOS calls RUIZ. NILDA asks if she is the same person who called the other day and said she was the widow of... (MATOS). The woman says 'yes' and NILDA tells her: "Look Miss, you're playing a very dangerous game."

MATOS: I don't know what you mean, miss.

NILDA: Well, because none of the comrades here is going to allow himself to be provoked. So, please do not keep on.

MATOS: Well, I don't know what you are referring to, miss, I am completely asonished.

NILDA: Well look, don't be astonished, you might end up some other way.

MATOS: I don't know what you are talking about.

NILDA: Well, we do.

NILDA hangs up.

Mrs. MATOS calls the Ambassador's secretary again; it seems there has been a misunderstanding.

NILDA: Look miss, we do not wish to talk to you anymore. We are telling you in a nice way. Please do not call anymore.

MATOS: I am not going to call again... I only want to say I had nothing to do... I know nothing at all. ... Only that I have received a message. I received a telephone call... I have just arrived in Madrid, I am not familiar with Madrid, or know anyone.

NILDA: Aren't you the one who called the other day? You made a date.

MATOS: What kind of a date?

NILDA: Didn't you make a date with the Charge d'Affaires?

MATOS: No, no. no. One moment, miss. I received a telephone call and was told to call this gentleman, the Cuban Ambassador. I could also tell jou about another ambassador, but that they were trying to get in touch with me.

NILDA: Who are 'they'? To whom do you refer when you say that 'they' called you?

MATOS: I was called on behalf of the Ambassador of Chile and the Ambassador of Cuba. I thought it was extremely unusual, miss, because I don't know anyone here.

NILDA: But, who called you, miss?
MATOS: Whoever it was said, "I am the Cuban Ambassador," so then it all seems to have been a plot, on something of the sort.
NILDA: Look, if it is a plot I suggest you do not get involved because where we are concerned it is somewhat dangerous.
MATOS: No miss, I am very proper and a serious person.
NILDA: Since you are so serious and proper don't ever let anything happen to you.
MATOS: I live with a daughter and you must realize that I live only for her.
NILDA: Well, look, if you live for her, don't get mixed up in these things for they may cost you dearly.
MATOS: Very well, miss. I am deeply grateful to have been enlightened by you. I can see already that it is simply a plot or an implication by someone.
NILDA: It is a plot and we know it. And we know who is behind it.
MATOS: Yes, miss. I would also like to know, I assure you.
NILDA: Well look, stay away from this mess or you'll pay dearly... good-bye.
MATOS: Fine, miss. I am also very grateful that you have told me. My apologies, huh?

NILDA was very upset after this call.

Attachment III

Report No. 262. 30 January 1970.

RUIZ records following memorandum on tape:

"Comrade NEIRA.- I take this opportunity that NILDA is going to Havana to bring to your attention some of our problems here in Spain.

"The first pertains to the construction project for a building which I sent to CHAIN with the President of the National Bank when he passed through here in December, and to this day, after five weeks, I have not received an adequate answer. You know that when preliminary negotiations are initiated one enters into certain obligations with the land owners as well as with the construction firm, to whom we must give an answer.

"On my insistence, Comrade ROA gave me... sent a cable informing me that as yet the budget had not been approved and he could not give me the results.

"Present locales do not meet the Spanish minimum requirements for working space. CURBELO brought from Havana proposals for the leasing of a locale for the Commercial Office with a rental fee of $2,000 a month. We discussed this proposal at a meeting of comrades here and it was rejected in the belief that it was more advantageous for us to buy. We also discussed this with Fermin GUTIERREZ, who visited the Commercial Office and to whom we pointed out that in view of the system of payment here in Spain it was better to purchase a building, since this transaction at no time would affect our system in our trade policy with Spain.

"To the point of being persistent we should like to request a building for all services: the Cuban Office, the Commercial Office, the Consulate-Embassy Office, plus living quarters on the top floor for the diplomatic Representative, something with which I am not in complete accord. In summary, a building which would offer maximum security and freedom of movement. The Commercial Office would occupy the first floor, the Embassy, the second floor, and the third floor the living quarters for the Chief of the Mission. This would resolve all our local problems and our representation in Spain.

"This construction firm built for the Rumanian representation in Spain and is row building for the Polish and others. We have been quoted a fixed price of $600,000 which includes a luxury building, with glass windows, air-conditioned, and other luxuries. This amount could be reduced if we bring our Cuban architects, who were here two years ago, and knowledgeable of their mission could discuss with the land owners and the construction firm those things they feel could be omitted and the price could be brought down considerably. We do not need a luxury building, but one that is attractive, simple and functional. Term payments could also be extended. I want to impress upon you that when we entered into negotiations we had a binding agreement."

"The lot is on Avenida La Habana. Fermín GUTIERREZ looked well into this matter. He asked me to send him the project and that he would look at it. The system of payments in Spain allows us to pay $100,000 or $150,000 annually which will not be difficult for us."

"NEIRA, I want you to talk to CHAIN, not bearing pressure on him, but to make him understand that what I want is to leave my successor established, for any construction not lasting over nine months I certainly will not be able to enjoy."

"Another thing I want to bring to your attention is in regard to our Consulate, its activities and relations with the Visa Section. A letter has come from VERA addressed to FRANCO pointing to FRANCO's incorrect wording of a cable to that Section. I agree that it was incorrect, but I find it strange that that Section should pay so much attention to correct forms and analyze the contents s0 little. The contents of things are not being studied, and it is essential that deep thought be given to the work that is being done. When someone comes to the Consulate with an authorization to travel to Cuba, it is usually three or four days prior to flight departure. Since the Visa Section must defer to the Department of Emigration for its authorization, inasmuch as the latter determines whether or not a foreigner can go into Cuba, the process is not carried out with the urgency that it requires, consequently, there is delay. This creates much inconvenience for us, and even personal problems, for we must consider that often people arrive with the exact amount of money and a week's delay could hurt them so that at times they don't even have enough money for lodging or food."

"At present we have the case of a member of the Chilean Communist Party and OSPAAAL whose passage has been set aside by these organizations to travel from Madrid to Cuba. Four days ago FRANCO sent a cable and still there is no answer. We made the decision to grant this person a visa because the plane leaves tonight, otherwise he will have to delay the trip one more week. If the tickets were reserved for him here there is no doubt he has been given authorization.

"NEIRA, I want you to talk to OJEDA and request that our Consulate be able to contact the Emigration Department directly. FRANCO has been on the job for approximately one year and has never given reason for complaints, but if he has now made a mistake in the editing of a cable it could have been that in the face of mounting problems he is presented with daily he might have exploded.

"Another thing I want to tell you is that last night we had as guests in our home the Chilean Director Hugo BENAVENTE and his wife, the leading lady in his Peruvian company which has brought to the stage "*Luz de Europa*." If they are not communists in the sense of the word, like the rest of the company, they do sympathize with us. They invited PINEDA to attend the premiere, and he answered with a cable which was shameful to see and read. The wording of that cable gives the impression that PINEDA 1s being held captive and asks them to please come to his help and send for him. He makes us look ridiculous. Just think that cable has been read by others before they showed it to me. The political position of PINEDA and other Cuban writers should be investigated, as now they are putting up on stage "*La Noche de los Asesinos*" and they also want another Cuban writer to come. I should like to get your advice in this area as I am totally ignorant of matters related to culture, for we have no cultural attache here.

"There is also the following problem: The comrades in the fishing / department /, specifically Comrade ARAGONES, are interested In having a radio communications station to contact ships on the high seas. In this regard I spoke to Mr.ASENJO in the Security Department who said there was no inconvenience on his part if they requested it and took the necessary steps. You know Mr. ASENJO. I saw him a month ago and he had asked me if we had decided not to go ahead with it, as there had not been an answer in that regard after having obtained authorization from the General Administration of Security which was the most difficult step.

"Comrade Joaquín ALVAREZ reports that in reference to the letters left here by LEON for the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Commerce here in Spain, the former is taking an offensive position in foreign relations as you can see, and the Minister of Commerce has been quite busy, for the entry of Spain in the Common Market is almost a fact and conversations are in progress. This is why they have assigned to Mr. SANTAMARIA, General Director of Commercial Policy, the study of subjects which the Spanish side plans to take up in Havana during the negotiations in February. I am in touch with this man and in fact had to call him up today, for he had said that before giving me the agenda of subjects to be discussed there was to be a meeting of Ministries to include Foreign Affairs, Commerce, Information and Tourism, plus others, to determine what was to be discussed in Cuba and decide on ther matters."

"Because Mr. SANTAMARIA was not in this morning, he has promised to call me at 6:30 this afternoon, but he will not find me here because I'll be taking NILWA to the airport."

"Tell Joaquín ALVAREZ that regarding the 50-million credit request from Cuba to Spain for 1970, there has been no confirmation inasmuch as we have been unable to talk with the present Secretary of Commerce. We find the figure somewhat high but have no basis for judgment to focus on any area."

"You must have heard already about the success of our reception. Not only because of the number, which was quite high, but because of the quality of the attendants. We had to use two rooms. We had prepared only one but when the Minister arrived it became necessary to open another room. There was representation from the ultra-right to the ultra-left. This has been a great triumph for us considering that in these countries the quality of people attending these events is taken well into account."

"Comrade NEIRA, an embrace for you and for those working with you. I hope when SONIA comes over she brings a project for 1970 that can be fully undertaken by us. We are very bad at making projects. This past year we did many things that had not been planned, while others that were planned remained undone, but with last year's experience we shall strive to plan better."

1.  Headquarters has just completed, with the able help of AMEDIT-2, a thorough review of QUDOZE tapes for the last quarter of 1969. We have added pertinent file material where necessary in order to round out the picture, but the review emerges primarily as an assessment of AMAUTO-1 as a personality and as a recruitment target. We forward this study as an attachment hereto, under separate cover, for your consideration.

2.  Headquarters has not lost its keen interest in AMAUTO-1 as a long-range recruitment target, foreseeing the possibility of defecting him in place (at least for the remainder of his posting to Madrid), or defecting him outright (which would admittedly be less desirable). In line with these purposes, we offer the follow- ing readings, which may or may not be entirely applicable to AMAUTO-1:

a. AMAUTO-1 is a shrewd, articulate person who has reached heights that probably he might not have reached under normal circumstances. His work in Spain has been effective in general, and he seems to be very confident of himself and of the backing which he thinks he has from PBRUMEN.

b. Nevertheless, he has received some rather telling criticism of a professional nature, even though it is unknown whether this criticism also touches on his personal life. Perhaps because of this, AMAUTO-1 seems to be very careful in whatever he does, avoiding mistakes that would endanger his position, and avoiding any real or fancied provocation.

c. There seems to be little question that AMAUTO-1 is approachable, although he would probably resist any indirect approach in which "cards are not laid on the table." It appears very likely that his character is basically incompatible with the system he serves (with profound misgivings as to its efficiency).

d. The very fact that he has made open remarks suggesting his unhappiness with PBRUMEN and his non-Marxist leanings in an office he himself points out is "bugged by the other side" could be interpreted as a signal from him, indicating that he is ready to listen. His remarks on the subject might be those of a man who believes he can "jump off" at any time, if necessary. Note that he tends to live with criticism from his home office rather than try to get out from under --- perhaps meaning that he would not accept a PCS assignment home. (The attachment hereto shows him describing a compatriot who wishes to return home as "a fool.") He has said himself that he believes ANTHUG-1 plans a major purge for mid-1970, and he might consider himself as a victim of that purge.

e. A fact which might affect timing is the arrival of a child in May. If he were to persuade his wife (and his government)to have the child in Spain, rather than return home for it, he would have a good excuse for requesting the presence of his oldest child (the only one who is now at home). If his wife returns home for delivery, he would (for a time at least) have three hostages in PBRUMEN instead of one.

f. UFGA-19006 reported a 1964 attempt to get at AMAUTO-1 through his wife's relatives. The consensus at the time was that AMAUTO-1 is probably immune to this type of approach. Headquarters, therefore, still opts for a logically developed, "traditional" recruitment build-up.

3. In line with the above, Headquarters suggests to Madrid certain lines of action which might be followed in an attempt to know more about AMAUTO-1. These actions might seem somewhat easier from our perspective than they actually are in the field, but we propose them for your consideration.

a. The man handling the new construction work (paragraph 16 of the attachment) should be checked out.

b. The established pattern of lonely automobile trips outside the capital (see paragraph 22 of the attachment) might be instructive to follow down. At least, the situation might offer a chance for approach or for subsequeat handling.

c. AMAUTO-1's desire to see more people at home, and the indication that he discusses important matters at home becomes doubly interesting with the possibility of a vacant house next door (see paragraph 18 of the attachment). The person who owns the apartment building might offer a fruitful lead.

d. The apparent hostility of the current maid (see paragraph 24 and 27 of the attachment) night offer further exploitation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 165

CONTINUATION OF DISPATCH OSMW-11726

e. AMAUTO/1's desire to affiliate himself with an exercise group (see paragraph 26b of the attachment) might-offer a possibility to put an access agent next to him. The circumstance would be relatively normal, not calculated to arouse his suspicions. The use of someone of WOLADY nationality might, in fact, help to allay what is evidently a tendency AMAUTO/1 has of suspecting provo- cation.

f. Headquarters would greatly appreciate the opportunity of examining AMAUTO/1's X-rays. In this connection, we would like to see an investigation of the physician used on this matter (see paragraphs 31 and 32 of the attachment).

g. We would like to have Madrid's assessment of the diplomat mentioned in paragraph 8 of the attachment.

4. At the same time, we would appreciate it if Miami could follow down any of the leads stemming from AMAUTO/1's time in WOLADY. We are trying to trace his entrance back in the 1950's and as much of his time here as possible, and perhaps Miami Station can develop leads on the persons mentioned in paragraph 24 of the attachment hereto, especially in reference to the brother left with the house. (Note Below.)

Michael V. SLATINSKI

I would appreciate your giving personal attention to this matter, because it is rare that we have such a detailed assessment as we have in this case.

# Under Separate Cover Attachment to: OSW-11726

## Orestes Guillermo RUIZ Pérez

DOB: c. 1931

Cuban Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain, accredited 12 December 1967.

## CHRONOLOGY

1.  RUIZ probably comes from a humble family in Cuba, because he lived in a solar (semi-slum area) and began to work when he was only fourteen years old. This circumstance suggests that he lacks a formal education. He appears to come from a "revolutionary" family (his father was identified as a Communist and a leader of the barbers' union in UFGA-13595, and a brother was identified as a member of the DSE as of 1964 in UFGA-19006)

2.  In the fifties RUIZ emigrated to the United States, traveling throughout the east coast and holding minor jobs. In 1957 he began to work as an apprentice butcher for a Polish-American named Alexander SAMKO, who had a grocery store on Flagler Street in Miami. He evidently did so well in attracting Latin American customers that he soon began to distribute meat in the area, working for SAMKO (RUIZ seems to be somewhat proud of this success). He also appears proud of the fact that when he left Miami in February 1958, he left his brother (same brother?) a house in North Miami, a brand new car, and over $1,000 in the bank.

3.  Although he did well in the meat business, he traces a large part of his success to another acquaintance in Miami: an American of Cuban descent known as Joe LOUIS (or LUIS). Joe LUIS was an underworld figure who was at that time competing with the Italians in the bolita (numbers) racket in Tampa, RUIZ and MOLEON (fnu), another Cuban exile, were each offered $$00 a month by LUIS to supervise bolita collections in Miami. (There is no specific indication that RUIZ took his bolita friend up on this offer). Furthermore, LUIS went so far as to offer RUIZ and MOLEON $5,000 apiece to kill a man named FERNANDEZ (fnu) who was also involved in the bolita racket in Miami.

4.  In February 1957 (note the 1958 date, above; perhaps an error on RUIZ' part) RUIZ left Miami along with a man named VILLEGAS (whose first name might be Harry) and three other members of the 26th of July Movement. They entered Cuba clandestinely. When the revolution triumphed in Cuba, Alexander SAMKO went to Havana, where he stayed for a week as RUIZ' house guest. SAMKO offered RUIZ a partnership in the meat business in Miami if he would return. RUIZ rejected the offer, saying that the Revolution needed him.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 167

5. RUIZ brags that in 1960 he was one of 18 persons out
   of 5,000 who were selected by the Ministry of the Treasury,
   where he was vorking at the time, to take a statistics course
   offered by CEPAL. The course, which lasted two years,
   included such subjects as pathematics, finance, democracy (?), and Marxism-Leninism. One of his schoolmates at the time was
   Marta ARCOL, now the director of the Museo de Arte in Havana.
   (It is interesting to note that in UFGA-13595 RUIZ was
   described as an anti-Communist as of 1960 by a Cuban refugee.

6. UFG-1539 reported RUIZ as Chief of the Department of
   Construction Expenses Studies of the Ministry of the Treasury
   in 1962, and he was described as a militant Communist. In
   1963 he was in Mexico, and UFGA-11065 Eentioned him as G-2,
   living at Calle Cuenavaca 35, apartment 7. A report from
   LITAMIL-9 in 1964 characterized RUIZ as a violent CASTRO
   _partisan, and AUG-) in 1964 described PUIZ as a CUIS officer.
   Presidential Decree 3440 of 4 August 1964 (UFGA-19006) reported
   RUIZ as being appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Commerce,
   and QUDOZE has him appointed about that time as chief of the
   trade school at MINCEX, a post he held for two years. In 1967
   he was appointed charge d'affaires in Madrid vice Francisco Ramon
   CALZADILLA.

ON THE JOB

7. There seems little doubt that RUIZ exercise the full
   authority that presumably he should have as Minister Pleni-
   potentiary. The relations between Cuba and Spain appear to
   remain static because of Spain's refusal to appoint a full
   Ambassador to Cuba after LOJENDIO was expelled from the island
   by CASTRO in 1959. RUIZ is involved in and is kept informed
   on all matters related to Cuban-Spanish relations, including
   trade. He does not seem to permit commercial attaches to bypass
   him when they submit reports to their respective home offices in
   Havana. In addition, RUIZ takes a keen and active interest in
   Cubana operations, and he has said that no one may travel to
   Havana on Iberia without his permission. He insists that Cuban
   officials arriving in Ladrid consult with him before arranging
   visits to Spanish officials or factories. He seems to have
   good working relations with Spanish government officials,
   because he is always careful to "put all his cards on the table"
   in meetings with them. (The tenor of his conversation seems to
   emphasize that he likes things this way in all his relations,
   personal as well as professional).

8. Little appears concerning RUIZ unofficial contacts
   with other diplomats in Madrid, except that he is close to and
   exchanges information with the Algerian Ambassador. (Accord-
   ing to current records, this is Ahmed LAIDI, posted to Madrid
   on 15 December 1966, living at Calle Tiemblo 3, Ciudad Puerto
   de Fierro. Latest desk traces show this person as born 20 April
   1931 in Oudja, Morocco, and as of 25 October 1966 to have been
   the Director General of the Foreign Ministry in charge of
   political, economic, and cultural affairs. He is described as


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 168

reserved, intelligent, and probably something of an operator. He was Ben Bella's chief of cabinci before joining the Foreign Office in 1961, and he functions more on special assignment than as part of the chain of command. He was a member of the Algerian UN delegation as of 28 September 1965.)

9. RUIZ tries to give the impression that he enjoys the full confidence of Osvaldo DORTICOS and Raul ROA, thereby being able to exercise the full authority of his position. He frequently tells other Cuban diplomats stopping in Madrid that he makes 90% of the decisions without consulting with Havana, explaining that "this is the reason I am here."

10. Above all, RUIZ directs constant and bitter criticism against Havana, because of what he terms the incompetence there. In his opinion, this generalized incompetence will cause CASTRO to carry out a major purge after the 1970 harvest is in. (He specifically repeats that "no one in Havana wants to make any sort of decision"). One of his favorite books is The Peter Principle, to which he refers constantly, and he uses this book to describe what is going on in Havana. In RUIZ' view, Havana is always trying to interfere with the Embassy in Madrid, a situation which results in a lack of coordination and cooperation. RUIZ directs the same criticism against his staff in Madrid, because his personnel lack qualifications for the jobs they hold. He once told an associate: "They think that I'm a fool, but I don't miss anything they do."

11. In turn, he has also been the target of criticism from Havana, first from Zoila GOMEZ (?), who made a critical evaluation of the Embass. RUIZ' reaction is instructive: "I decided not to answer it. I took a librium, smoked a cigar, and forgot all about it." On another occasion he complained to Aristides DIAZ that he had received another critical report from Havana regarding his program for the Embassy. Havana was complaining that not much had been achieved. RUIZ noted that the Embassy had accomplished much that was not in the plan, and he intended to answer that particular criticism in detail.

12. Perhaps the most serious criticism of his activities came in a coded cable received by the Embassy carly in October 1969. Havana questioned the way that RUIZ was handling the commercial treaty negotiations with Spanish authorities. In a communication directed to Raul. LEON Torres (201-725624) (Under Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Commerce) and in rather strong language, RUIZ defended his right to be informed and consulted on the matter, denying that his cable number 521 was offensive to Joaquin ALVAREZ (Director of Trade with Western Europe and North America), who was evidently the source of criticism against RUIZ.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 169

# SECRET

-4-

13. Evidently, this last piece of criticism upset RUIZ so much that he was nervous and particularly security-conscious. Less than a week later he called LEON in Havana and requested permission to go to Cata, ostensibly to settle a personal problem with his son. However, his wife explained to another person in the Embassy that RUIZ' trip was due to his sick mother. His trip was probably due to the exceptionally sharp criticism and RUIZ' desire to clear it up personally.

14. When RUIZ returned to Madrid on 29 October 1969, he was a changed man, again relaxed and fully confident of himself. Nevertheless, be has told close friends that he feels very lonely in Spain and at times has had the desire simply to board a plane away from Spain and abandon the Embassy. Ilis always careful to say he desires to return to Havana, but he leaves room for the inference that he would rather go somewhere else. He believes that he is "burned", in Spain. He has said that when he returns to the island, he will definitely not return to his Ministry.

## SECURITY AND SECURITY-CONSCIOUSNESS

15. RUIZ seems to be particularly sensitive in the area of security-consciousness... This attitude can possibly be traces to an involvement with the DGI in one way or another, but his background and especially his political views (sec below) would appear to argue against his affiliation. RUIZ is quick to warn visiting Cubans against the efforts of what he terms "Ja compania, sociedad anesiza" to compromise them, even before they leave Havana, indicating RUIZ' possible belief in the omnipresence and power of the sociedad anonima. He censors mail going to and coming from Havana, and the repeatedly states that his office is bugged, bis telephone is tapped, and that he is followed quite openly wherever he goes. He attributes this surveillance to the Seguridad, and he probably ascribes it to the Spanish. (Note that, despite his "knowledge" that his words go to hostile surveillance, he still dares to express critical opinions openly).

16. This security-consciousness is apparently the big reason he has asked Havana for funds for a new Embassy building, where he plans to have a shielded room free from bugs. He intends to have Havana send electricians for the job and Cuban personnel to act as doormen, etc.. with the wives of the latter to be his. char force. He seems fanatic on the subject of not having any Spanish personnel in the building. (Note that one Sr. VILLARROYA, of Constructiones Aznar in Madrid, is handling the real estate operation.)

17. RUIZ is particularly aware of what he calls "traps." He once recalled that he had been asked to dinner by the wife of a VIP and, after accepting the invitation, was told that a priest would also attend. He did not attend the dinner, although it considerably upset his hostess, because he was afraid of a scandal arranged by the police. He said that he receives only in the Embassy, because through that door can enter only those whom he wants to see.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 170

14-00000

- 5 -

18. Nevertheless, RUIZ has several times mentioned that he holds his really important conversations at home, and that he would rather see more people at his hoac instead of at his office. (In this connection, it is noted that the house next door to his --- Calle Triana 11 --- which used to be a home for the aged) is now empty. The owner of the apartment building where he lives is Ignacio ARTERO, a Spaniard.

19. RUIZ has even suggested installing a radio transmitter and speaking in code with Havana. The Cubans are in fact installing a transmitter on the Canary Islands, but RUIZ, characteristically keeping his actions correct, has stressed to the Spanish that Cuba will not use the transmitter for other than legitimate commercial purposes. RUIZ even offered to allow Spanish citizens to operate the station in order to emphasize his point.

20. Correct as he generally is in his professional behavior, RUIZ made what appears to be a mistake in discussing with members of his staff the possibility of telling Havana that a Spanish foreign service officer scheduled for duty there (Juan TORROBA Gomez, cf. OSMA-25692) might be open for recruitment. If one recalls RUIZ' constant warnings that his office is bugged by Seguridad, the discussion about TORROBA clearly exposes him to action by the Spanish authorities.

21. RUIZ himself is the target of what appears to be control by Juan Antonio CURBELO Lemus (201-733544) who is allegedly the First Secretary in charge of cultural affairs but who seems to be the "security man" in the Embassy. (We note that CURBELO's photograph was shown to AMBEDEW-1, who did not recognize the likeness). RUIZ has complained at least once that he needs a "real" cultural attache. CURBELO has instructed the front-desk girl to pass on to him a summary of who sees whom at the Embassy and for what purpose, including RUIZ' visitors. (Given RUIZ' near-mania for running his own shop, CURBELO must indeed exert an acknowledged security control).

22. Despite security considerations, however, RUIZ appears addicted to taking automobile jaunts by himself to the interior of the country. He must have very powerful reasons to do so, for he is probably exposing himself to attack by Cuban exiles. Given the reception accorded to Carlos ALFARAS, Armando HART, and Carlos CHAIN at the Barajas airport in June 1968, RUIZ might be unnecessarily exposing himself. He has not told anyone of where he goes or what he does, and both his wife and CURBELO strongly disapprove of his custom.

FAMILY

23. RUIZ' wife is Nilda VECIANA, who was reported on in UFGA-19006. She is probably in her early thirties. She is pregnant and due to have her fifth (?) child carly in May 1970. She has had difficulties with her pregnancy because of recurring


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 171

- 6 -

fainting spells and overweight. These conditions are being treated by Dr. HERNANDEZ (fnu) and Dr. MATA (Inu).

24. Nilda is a pleasant woman who has not been known to quarrel with her husband or express political or religious opinions, although once she recited the Lord's Prayer by heart in front of others. A teacher by profession, she handles the bookkeeping at the Embassy on an informal basis. She appears to have a rather weak character, judging from the way she handles her boys. According to Severina ORTIZ Gomez, the maid, these are little beasts who treat the servaats badly, even reviling them with obscenities, while referring to their mother as "la chula." Nilda does not permit the boys to be punished.

25. Nilda goes shopping by herself, and once she even took a taxi by herself to the airport to meet her husband, even though CURBELO did not like the idea at all. She seems to get along well with the wives of other Cubans on the staff.

26. RUIZ' children are:

a. Guillermito. He is the oldest and is now studying in Havana. There were reports that he was unhappy there, and RUIZ asked on 16 October 1969 to go to llavana to settle a personal problem with Guillermito. If there were a problem, it seems to have been solved, because RUIZ on his return quoted Guillermito as being very happy in his new school. (Some time ago, Mrs. Hector GALLO Portieles was constantly needling the other women about not being "revolutionary" enough and took Nilda RUIZ to task for having her children with her instead of at school in Cuba. The RUIZ family had brought four of their children with them, and later the other(s) came to join them, before the older one returned to school. RUIZ once told a visitor that Guillermito had been left with his grandparents during their exile in Miami and had been very resentful of it, so they had been very careful ever since not to repeat that mistake).

b. Alejandro. lle is about six years old. According to those who know him, he is the real devil of the lot as well as a good swimmer. lle is taking guitar lessons, goes to Colegio Estilo, and swims at Cimnasio Mascardo, Pilar de Zaragoza 99. (Nilda has talked to the Gimnasio people about RUIZ' going there also for swimming or exercise).

c. Ivan.

d. Juan Carlos.

e. One other (?)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 172

27. All four children are very spoiled and have caused several maids to leave their jobs. Severina bitterly complains that the children show no respect for their parents, and that is the reason Severina gives for her hate for Nilda.

## EDUCATION AND CULTURE

28. Aside from the two-year statistics course taken in 1960, RUIZ appears to lack a solid, formal education, although he makes up for it by being an avid reader (five newspapers a day plus books). He understands and speaks English and French (fluency unknown) and has undertaken to teach grammar (presumably Spanish) to the Embassy staff.

29. RUIZ appears to be sensitive to art, and he frequently complains about the general lack of culture in Cuba. (This might indicate thatRUIZ considers himself "above" the Revolution). He shows some of the general inconsistencies of the self-educated. For example, his vocabulary level is rather low, and he curses frequently when talking to other male members of the staff. On the other hand, he seems rather well versed in international affairs and has a good understanding of international trade. It is probable that he has read some of the works of José Marti and, although he dictates letters to his secretary, he types some of his own reports to Havana.

## HEALTH PROBLEMS

30. RUIZ suffers from what his wife has described as a liver illness (not further specified) for which he takes a medicine called bilidis. (This may refer simply to the medical words for "liver disease". Competent experts here guess that the medicine is used for anything from chronic constipation to gassiness and constant eructation because of inadequate digestion of fatty foods. It is possible that RUIZ suffers from the hard-to-pin-down *mal de foie*, which can be found in a high-strung, hard-driving person. RUIZ' evident use of librium (see above) might also suggest this condition).

31. Late in 1969 RUIZ was planning to go to Portugal to rest, following the recommendation of his physician Dr. CAVAS (also received as CABAS and CALDAS), and whose telephone number appears to be 276-77-46. There is also a mention of a Dr. PERIU, but his relationship is indistinct. RUIZ coughs frequently, is used to cold weather, and was planning to go for his health to the same Gimnasio as his son, Alejandro.

32. A July 1968 memorandum for the record stated that RUIZ suffers from a spinal ailment resulting from a fall he had about 12 years ago. Since then he has had chronic backaches which were particularly severe during the time that he was in the U.S., Haiti, and Santo Domingo. His pains have recurred since he arrived in Spain. On 3 June 1968 he had a severe attack and was


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 173

treated by the Embassy's Spanish doctor VILLALANDA (fnu), who prescribed cortisone. Ilis condition was diagnosed as incurable, since it was doubted that the injury to his spine could be corrected by an operation. RUIZ was further told that the condition would continue to grow worse, and that within six to ten years he would have a defective walk. RUIZ planned to send the diagnosis and X-rays to ROA in Havana, who would pass them to the Cuban specialist MARTINEZ-PAZ for review.

TRAVEL'S

33. Following are the trips RUIZ is known to have made during the last quarter of 1969:

a. To Bilboa, San Sebastian, and Burgos by car, on 28 November 1969, returning two days later.

b. To Havana, to settle "a personal problem," on 20 October 1969 vía Iberia (first class), returning to Madrid on 29 October.

c. To London on 14 November for consultations with Raul LEON Torres, returning two days later by air.

d. To Italy with his family on vacation on 28 December to pick up an Alfa Romero that he bought for the Embassy, returning by car and arriving in Madrid on 6 January 1970.

CONTACTS IN MADRID

34. Little is known about RUIZ' contacts in Madrid. Aside from the Algerian Ambassador (see above), we know about:

a. Pedro RUIZ. A good friend who goes to RUIZ' home frequently. According to RUIZ, Pedro is quite influential and is a friend of MASSO(?).

b. Carlos CARRASCO. Another person who calls RUIZ frequently. In late October or early November 1969 CARRASCO went to New York.

c. Rosendo CANTO (201-749310). CANTO lives at Goya 54, Madrid. His friendship with RUIZ is interesting, given CANTO's background, because their being together could be very dangerous for RUIZ unless he were using CANTO for some reason with the approval of Havana. CANTO wants to go to Havana for a year, live there for a year, and then join the Cuban Foreign Service. Referring to CANTO's desire, RUIZ said on 8 January 1970: "He is a fool!"

CHARACTER

35. Superficially, RUIZ seems to be an easy-going and rather simple man who no doubt enjoys the prestige and position he has and the successes he has had professionally in Spain. He appears to have a strong character and probably plays the predominant role in his marriage. He and his wife seem to get along very well


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 174

- 9 -

together, and they are not heard to argue.. On the other hand,
there appear to be very deep inconsistencies in his public
and private behavior. Sometimes he speaks like a man at war
with himself.

36. A certain degree of racism can be detected in his
    constant reference to blacks as "niches," a disrespectful
    Cuban colloquialism roughly comparable with the pejorative
    word, "nigger."

37. RUIZ almost never discusses women with his colleagues,
    except for one off moment when he mentioned a girl he knew
    in the United States before the Revolution. Perhaps RUIZ wisely
    remembers that Nilda also works at the Embassy and refrains
    from mentioning women on her account. In any case, he is not
    known to be involved in any extramarital affair. (Still, one
    wonders about the custom of absenting himself by automobile
    into the interior of Spain).

38. His habits seem to be simple: he likes movies; he
    has read Topaz (but made no comment thereon); and he receives
    people at his home for cocktails.

POLITICAL AND. I DEOLOGICAL VIEWS

39. Although outwardly a "Revolutionary," RUIZ gives much
    more the appearance of a man with moderate political views
    struggling to justify to himself the actions of his government,
    especially in view of the political and economic realities of
    his country. It is possible that his feelings might lie
    closer to the theory of the "betrayed revolution" ---but not
    for strictly ideological reasons. The incompetence of the
    Cuban governmental bureaucracy, for example, has sabotaged the
    revolution.

40. In the first place, RUIZ definitely does not seem
    to be a Marxist and consequently he cannot accept the role of
    "robot" (his term) required by Party discipline and vertical
    structure.

a. On 29 December 1969 he wrote to Telesforo
DIAZ Portillo, a MINREX official: "Revolutionaries
should not be coerced by forms of political control."

b. On 11 December 1969 he told a visiting
Agropecuario official from Havana that: "... if I
disagree with orders, I question them because I am
not a robot nor do I have the mentality of one. As
a human being I express opinions no matter what the
risk that I may have to accept personally."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

c. RUIZ seems to have little compunction in talking to what he thinks of as old acquaintances, even though they may be on the opposite side of the political fence from him. He once mentioned how he weat out of his way to greet a "gusano" on the street because they had been friends in Havana. The Cuban exile evidently turned away from him, but RUIZ defended his own action in initiating the greeting.

41. Aside from the constant criticism of Havana's incompetence, lack of vision, and lack of realism, he is quick to point out the deficiencies of life in Cuba as reflected in his directive to his Embassy staff not to celebrate Christmas together, because there are hungry people at home. RUIZ has also said that medicine in general is quite backward in Cuba.

42. Although he is probably an athiest (or likes to think of himself as one), he is known to believe that "religion should not be considered a handicap for persons trying to return to Cuba." He does not hide his views of the American people, either, for he describes Americans as "frank" and "simple". "They treated me very well," he told Raul LEON Torres in December 1969. On the other hand, he refers to Latin American diplomats as bootlickers because they use the English language at parties, and he has remarked that "capitalism is no good."

43. Ile seems to have a certain admiration for General Francisco FRANCO, of whom RUIZ has said: "FRANCO is the only reason that Spain is not Communist." RUIZ also called FRANCO "one of the few most brilliant politicians of all time." These seem like strange words for a man as security-conscious as he.

44. He appears to be well-informed on international matters. Some of his views are contradictory at times, but they characterize him as what might be called an undecided realist:

a.  "Cuba is a political power, not a military or economic power."

b.  "The USSR has neutralized US sea power in the Mediterranean."

c.  "Cuba can destroy Guantanamo whenever it chooses to do so, although the base has lost its strategic value to the United States."

d.  "US-China rapproachment should be feared, but also a Japan-China alliance."

e.  "US power is beginning to crumble, but the Soviets are revisionists."

f.  "The Egyptians harm us when they buy sugar from Cuba and then resell to other countries."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 176

g. "We have to be on the side of the Soviets for two reasons: first from the military and economic point of view; secondly, because, whether right or wrong, they are on the same side fighting those who are on the other side."

h. "Cuba has had and now has major discrepancies with the USSR, China, and the US, but we are on the side of communism because we are against capitalism."

ATTENTION : Connie Terry

SUBJECT : Cuban Charge d'Affairs Comments on Czechoslovakian Situation

REFERENCE : OSMA-25789, dated 7 January 1970

1. The following comments of the Cuban Minister to Spain, Guillermo RUIZ Perez, reflect Cuban thoughts on the Czechoslovakian situation:

The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has been a disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet action would mean taking sides with the Americans. A friend may be criticized in private but publicly be should be defended. (QUDOZE, 19 November.) The Cubans have to side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the same ideological group. Cuba had and still has enormous discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and the United States but weighing the differences Cuba is with Communism and opposed to Capitalism. (QUDOZE, 3 November.)

2. The above information was obtained from a Sensitive Source and should be protected as such.

## R. H. .1

## 4 December 1969

Ruiz is talking with Garciolo and Granaco about the new building opportunity. They are negotiating for an O.R. spot downtown. Ruiz is concerned about the maintenance of the building, as it has six floors and a basement. Havana will have to send an electrician, who is also a plumber, and then understands some-thing of carpentry. They will need three or four other men to act as doormen, watchmen, etc. The wives of those men will be the charwomen of the building. Garciolo says once that Havana approves the building they will have to sit down and talk over their difficulties (Havana Spanish personnel). Ruiz doesn't want Spanish personnel under any circumstances. He speaks of having two dining rooms, one for the General Office and the other for the Ministry; here meals prepared outside will be served. The dining room will be completely isolated so that no visitor or invited guest will be able to place anything in the ceiling nor in the walls without being seen. They are going to install a closed circuit television so that all entries and exits will be controlled. Ruiz says that a Japanese type television of the kind they are discussing only costs not thing over $300, and he adds that most likely there is one in the American embassy.

Joaquin AUVI Casals, Lazaro GARRIDO Sanchez & Antonio MARQUEZ Pedraza

1. Of possible interest to addressees is a translation of the following letter dictated by Guillermo RUIZ Perez to his secretary on 26 December 1969. The letter was addressed to a comrade "OCUZA or LANUZA (fon)" in Havana in response to a confidential note received by RUIZ from Havana.

"In relation to your confidential note number 7240 about the Spanish prisoners, Joaquin AUVI Casals, Lazaro GARRIDO Sanchez and Antonio MARQUEZ Pedraza, whose release was requested in a note from the Spanish Embassy in Havana, I would like to tell you the following: Firstly, Senor Joaquin AUVI Casals was of interest to D. Pedro SALVADOR de Vicente; but because of the bad record and activities of this man, it was understood that his departure would be denied. I talked to Pedro SALVADOR about this matter and upon mentioning this man's background he told me that his interest was due to a phone call he had received from a friend of his in Miami. He considers that, given the background in this case, his friend was supposedly an instrument of "other interests". Secondly, regarding the other Spaniards, we have no objection whatsoever to their departing the country. Without anything of further consequence,....."

SOURCE An official Spanish service from a source described as sensitive and usually reliable.

1. On 23 September 1969 the Cuban Minister to Spain, Guillermo Ruiz Perez, called on Pedro Salvador de Vicente, the Special Delegate for Latin American Affairs in the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to discuss the forthcoming trade negotiations in Cuba. During the discussion Salvador told Ruiz that the one and only question which concerns the Spanish Government is that of Cuban indemnifications and pensions for Spanish employees, and he asked Ruiz what the latter could say regarding this problem. (Field Comment: The indemnifications refer to property owned by Spanish nationals which was confiscated by the Cuban Government.) Ruiz claimed that he had no instructions on what he could say, adding that the claims were numerous and that the paperwork involved was difficult and required a great deal of time.

2. Salvador told Ruiz that the subject of indemnifications and pensions must be discussed during the forthcoming negotiations, and that the Cuban Government must provide at least an approximate figure of what it is going to pay. He said that the indemnification figure must be based on the value of the expropriated properties, less the amount of any taxes levied on the properties. (Source Comment: Salvador did not say what would happen if the Cuban Government failed to reach some agreement on the question but he implied that negotiations would be delayed until the Spanish Foreign Ministry received the Cuban Government's reply to this question.) (Field Comment: Since the conversation between Salvador and Ruiz was held before the recent change of the Spanish Cabinet and other Government positions, there is no

information on how these changes would affect the question
raised by Salvador or the signing of a new trade agreement
with Cuba. As of 17 November 1969, Salvádor was still
Special Delegate for Latin American Affairs.)

3. (Field Comment: Until recently, the indemnifications
   and pensions problem had not emerged as a serious factor in
   the negotiations for a new trade agreement. There has been
   a gradual deterioration of Spanish-Cuban commercial relations
   since the conclusion in May of preparatory negotiations for
   a new agreement, but this deterioration ostensibly was the
   result of a Spanish Government decision to reduce Cuban sugar
   imports over the next three years. The Cuban Government
   apparently had not considered such decision in its analysis
   of Cuban-Spanish commercial relations, and it was quite
   upset when the decision was revealed during the preparatory
   negotiations. Some of the problems causing the strain in
   Spanish-Cuban relations were previously reported in
   TDCSDB-315/2470-69, TDCSDB-315/02182-69, TDCSDB-315/03509-69,
   CS-311/08659-69 and CSDB-312/02600-69.).

Report No. 2274

N.T.

One 'Miss' CONCHITA calls asking for RUIZ. NILDA says she is his secretary and CONCHITA may leave the message with her. C and R have not seen each other for two years and C would like to surprise him. NILDA asks for her last name; C does not give it to her because it would then fail to be a surprise, but leaves her telephone number (201-49-89) for R to call her after 8, for she works until that time. On NILDA's insistence C gives her last name as CAMACHO, adding she is the widow of the doctor who was director of the Coimbra Hospital.

RUIZ calls Mrs. CAMACHO at 201-49 89. She begins the conversation by saying they had met at a party which she had attended with her husband at the Dominican Embassy in Madrid. She reminds him that they had talked with the Faraguayan Ambassador and former Dominican Ambassador Rafael COMPRES, and that the party had taken place two years ago. Despite all the details RUIZ insists he does not remember her and asks how he can be of service to her. She tells him "I have just arrived and find myself somewhat isolated, disoriented, and I must find work. I recall you telling me on that ocassion 'If you should ever have any problem and you come to Madrid, look me up.'" One other ambassador also offered me his assistance and I have tried to

locate both of you." Mrs. C mentions having a daughter, that her husband was a pilot and that she is a Spaniard, adding she is not too old. R replies that in all honesty he does not remember her. She insists on seeing him to have a chat, and R suggests she come to his office at her convenience. She prefers talking with him alone, without his secretary or anyone else present, and suggests a bar at some hotel like the Palace, Ritz or Hilton. He is agreeable to any place she may desire; they agree to meet that night at 9:30 in the lobby of the Hilton Hotel. She will be dressed all in black.

RUIZ calls FERNANDO. P is to meet R outside the latter's home about 9 o'clock dressed in coat and tie.

Report No. 2248.

HORACIO calls the telephone company requesting the address for telephone number 201-49-89. The information is denied.

RUIZ calls PILOTO to have him meet RAUL LEON in Barajas that night. RUIZ is unable to do so because of a previous engagement.

FERNANDO calls CURBELO to ask for PUGA's phone number. F wants to tell F he cannot meet the professor at P's house that night because he (?) has to take RUIZ somewhere.

QUDOZE
Comments of AMAUTO-1 on Current Topics of Interest

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

The following comments of AMAUTO-1 reflect Cuban thoughts on the Czechoslovaquian situation, internal Spanish politics, and the effects of recent changes in the Spanish Government on the impending trade negotiations between Spain and Cuba.

a. The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia has been a disaster; however, criticizing the Soviet action would mean taking sides with the Americans. A friend may be criticized in private but publicly he should be defended. (QUDOZE, 19 November.). The Cubans have to side with the Soviets for military and economic reasons and because, whether right or wrong, they belong to the same ideological camp. Cuba had and still has enormous discrepancies with the Soviet Union, China, and the United States but weighing the differences Cuba is with Communism as opposed to Capitalism. (QUDOZE, 3 November.)

b. AMAUTO-1 was asked by his government to report on the new Spanish Government which Havana calls "Opus Dei". To a visiting Cuban official he admitted that he was at a loss to understand Spanish politics but attempted to define them. It is not true that the Spanish Government is in the hands of the Opus Dei. There are some men in the government who lean.toward the Opus Dei but there are others of a very different leaning because they come from the Falangist ranks. These men (the Falangists) may go along with the Opus Dei line because they allow themselves to be "carried by the tide" but they are not of the Opus Dei. (QUDOZE, 19 November.)

c. Concerning the impending trade negotiations with Spain, in addition to the economic problem the Cubans are now faced with another impediment which further delays the negotiations: the recent changes in the Spanish government. It is difficult at this time for the Cubans to approach any Spanish official because of the climate of confusion among them. Most Spanish officials have no idea as to whether they will remain in their posts or will be replaced. Therefore, it is futile for the Cubans to press them for action on the negotiations. The most they can do is wait patiently until the situation is normalized. If the negotiations are not held within the 30-day expiration period of the agreement, it is possible that the present agreement can be extended for two months. This would be advantageous to the Cubans because during the first two months of the year they will be able to acquire all the goods they will need for 1970. (QUDOZE, 19 November).

1. Please cancel all clearances mentioned in Reference. Since AMAUTO13's separation from ANAUTO-1's household and her Immigration to the United States with her husband, AMAUTO-5, we no longer have an oporational interest in her. As you know, AMAUTO-3 was used solely as an intermediary for a warm approach to AMAUTO-2. This was accomplished, and we have had no further contact with her. No Station contact was ever made with AMAUTO-4.

2. After the departure of AHAUTO-2 from AMAUTO-1's household, the Station soon learned of her replacemont and this information was passed to the QUSEQUIN'S. It was decided that the QUSEQUINS would attempt to recruit the new domestic, but for unknown reasons, contact was never made. We believe that there is a new domestic now working in the AMAUTO-1 household, but we have no details on her.

TYPIC/QUDOZE/Juan TORROBA Gomez, Spanish Minister to Cuba

On 10 October 1969, Guillermo RUIZ Perez, Cuban Charge in Madrid dictated a letter to the Cuban Foreign Office setting forth his impressions of Juan TORROBA Gomez. These impressions by RUIZ can be interpreted as the preparation of a target study on TORBOBA. The following is a verbatim text and translation:

El analisis que se realiza sobre las activadades desarrolladas por el Senor Juan Torroba y su -, la falta de interes y com- prension de parte de nos da un conocimiento directo sobre las actividades de la Embajada de Espana en esa que nos puede ser muy util en nuestras relaciones. Antes de su llegada hemos tratado de ahondar en la personalidad del Senor Torroba y aparte de con- firmar la buena opinion que los espanoles tienen sobre su persona, hemos conocido tambien que es hombre debil de caracter y que en esa medida pueda ser influenciado a pesar de su ---- personalidad (o capacidad). El cargo quo desempeña de sub-Director de Asuntos Consulares es en realidad un cargo de asesor en materias consulares pero sin mando. Es acortado la tesis de ayudarlo en su trabajo y aun llegar al extremo de que algun funcionario como el intimide con el de forma tal que esa debilidad de caracter y propension a la influencia ajena pueda servirnos a nuestros propositos. Es indudable que un ataque al Senor Torroba en el sentido de hacer deficil su tarea traeria como consecuencia inmediata una mayor influencia de aquellos que sin lugar a dudas estan interesados en que se convierta en -----. Por otra parte no consideramos posible que aun en el caso de que su trabajo no sea el mejor pueda hacerse una substitucion de otro funcionario que

TRANSLATION:
The study being made of the activities of Mr. Juan Torroba
and his (word indistinct), the lack of understanding and interest
on the part of (word indistinct), give us a direct insight into
the activities of the Spanish Embassy there (in Cuba) which could
be very useful to us in our relations (with the Spaniards). Defore
his arrival (in Havana) we tried to probe into the personality of
Mr. Torroba and, in addition to confirming the good opinion that
Spaniards have of him, we learned that he is weak in character
and that from this angle he could be influenced despite his
(word indistinct) personality. The position he held as Deputy
Director of Consular Affairs (in the Spanish Foreign Ministry)
vas actually that of advisor on-consular matters but he exercised
no authority. The idea of helping him in his work is apt and
could be carried to the point where some officer like himself
(of similar category) could intimidate him in such a way that
his weakness of character and susceptibility to outside influence
vould serve our purposes. There is no doubt that an attack
against Sr. Torroba in the way of making his task more difficult
would bring as an isamediate result a greater influence on the
part of those who are interested in having him become a (word
indistinct). On the other hand we do not consider it possible
even in the event that his work should not prove to be the best,
that another officer could be substituted that (word or words
indistinct).

In order to resolve the question of handling from this
Dabassy the departure of the (word indistinct), please clarify
the reason why there has been a misinterpretation. Averything
to the problems of Spain and Cuba through this babassy will, of
course, redound to our benefit. A clear case is the application
for departure of (word indistinct) and his statement that perhaps
(word or words indistinct) since the Embassy in Cuba...(volume

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

SOURCE: US national, college student.

Source has been successful in a modest building construction operation, and appears to have access to investment funds. Ee is a rew cource. His cooperation is by way of a prominent US police official, long a friend of his family.

1. A [US] friend of wine and I first met Manuel Tello, then Chilean Consul General in San Francisco, late in 1963, December, at the San Francisco Press Club. At that time, Tello was accompanied by several attractive young women, one of whom was his daughter, Carmen. Tello proved to be a gracious, polished diplomatic type and we all hit it off well together. As a matter of fact, we hit it off so well that Tello visited my friend's home from time to time, managed to interest him in a number of business ventures to be launched in Chile and later in Costa Rica.

2. Tello was quite active in the San Francisco area. Among his official interests were the sponsoring of a Chilean or pro-Chilean youth group, and an attempt to organize a group of businessmen able to finance commercial ventures in Chile. Integral parts of his plans were the Alliance for Progress funding and the recent California-Chile commercial and cultural programs. Ventures were to include the construction of several hundred thousand dwellings in Chile, a commercial fishing venture, to be based at Iquique, establishment of a fish meal plant also at Iquique, and the acquisition of a huge ranch or finca near Puntarenas in Costa Rica. Latter project, however, seemed more personally Tello's, whereas he was to be but one of several other investors in the others.

3. As months went on, suspicions of Tello's motives began to grow. Normal avarice is easily understood, but in the course of visits to my friend's home Tello began to hazard unmistakably anti-American expressions. He went to learn that he was an attorney and had come from an old and wealthy Chilean family, but was something of a "black sheep". He spoke of his mother's apologetic references to him as "her Communist son". Tello claimed intimacy with Salvador Allende and made it clear that "when", not "if", Allende was elected president, Tello was to be extremely influential in the new hierarchy. Incidentally, he also stated

emplationil that if by any remoto chance Allende vere not to win, there would be a revolution in Chile by November 1964. Tello claieed also that be had visited several tices with Raul Castro, and had cct Fidel, all within the past year or so. He insisted that the US would recognize Cuba before the end of 1964. Tello said also that bo vas on good terus with important people in both the Soviet and Chinese Communist governments, and that both nations were anxious to have him as Chile's ambassador, but that he was not especially anxious to go. Another reference to Communist China was the possibility that Chile might have, come swall cargo ships built there.

Tello!a pro-Comet and anti-American feelings verd phared with his daughter, Carmento claimed to have been a youth in leader in the University of Chile. Another daughter, Patricia I believe her name is, was said to be even core intensely anti-US. Either she or her husband 18 connected with a latin American organization, possibly the OAS or Pan-American Union. Another daughter is carried to the director of personnel in the Fertica plant in Costa Rica.

5.  At times, it was clear that Tello's averice transcended his coacera for the poor. Once when another American suggested that the building of the houses in Chile would give employment to cany more Chileans if they avoided use of pre-fab units and pre-cut timbers, etc, Tello tas not interested. He wanted to get in, get as much as possible, and get out as soon as possible. At times he referred to plans to live in Europe after he had made a few financial killings.

6.  I have details on only one Chilean proposal, this a fish meal operation known as Cachagus. It was forwed within the rast year with an authorized capital of E850 thousand (approximately US$557,500), about half cổ which was paid in. The prime investors were said to be Lorst Farique Eagemen, Emilio Jarron Martinez, Gaston Pascal Icon, Cristian Casanova Subercaseaux, and Gonzalvo Subercaseaux Canartu. Its cain office is in Santiago; its plant in Iquique. Sowewhere behind the scenes was Tello.

7.  Somehow, in a Carter I do not pretend to understand, Tello really wanted an American "frent-can" in order to withdraw carnings in excess of what the law permitted. His planning for an American's participation included marriage to his oldest daughter, Carten, who was later involved in a shooting incident in San Francisco in June 1954, shortly after the departure of her father to his new post in San Jose, Costa Rica, where he is now Charge d'Affaires.

8.  In Costa Rica, Tello seems to have considerable influence also. One of his schemes there is the acquisition or a huge ranch in the Puntarenas area. The property, now self-supporting, lies between the Pan American highway and the Gulf of Nicoya. lic plans to develop it both for commercial ana residential purposes with the operation of a gambling sanctuary in the to-be-established resort section.

9.  Teilo'z successor as Chile's consular representative in San Francisco it Rector Surr Ee appears to have the same anti-Us bias as Tello. At the tize of the supposedly self-inflicted gun shot wound of Teilo's daughter, Carson, Eury said, "This is an international incident. y governcent vill decond an apology from the United States." It is مده guess by this tips that Bar was interested only in cavating anti-US ill will in Chile so as to enhance the electica possibilitics of aliendo.

7 October 1969

HILAL Datha & Guillermo Marin to visit the Ministry of Foreign Commerce, Tel-70-05-69. Guillermo Ruiz wants to take to Raul Leon. Ruiz says, We had the meeting, that I told you about, today. There was no time to cancel as your cable didn't arrive on time. Consequently I had to attend. Because I had no concrete instructions, I was limited to listening to their good wishes and to try to arrive at an understanding between us. The Marquise that conducted the meeting was very pleasant and conciliatory. When they started to talk figures, I avoided the issue. Then I said that this meeting would be nothing more than to make contact between us and that at the moment there was nothing more I could do. We agreed to hold another meeting on 17 October, at which time they would like to hear our ideas. I promised nothing, but that I would confirm the meeting by telephone. He (the Marquise?) said that this would give no time to discuss it.

Leon says "Did they say anything about the ODA affairs?"

Ruiz says "No, just ideas on other things, but they in no way mentioned the ODA affair." Raul says "Just ideas in general". Ruiz says, "Just commercial ideas. They wanted to hear the Cuban ideas". Ruiz wants Leon to send him instructions for the next meeting. He wants to know if anyone is coming from Havana to attend the meeting.

## RUIZ CALLS TERCEIRO AT IBERPLAN (phon).

They greet one another very cordially, and Ruiz thanks him for sending the list. Terceiro asks how things were in Havana. Ruiz says fine in every sense, and adds "they are in the ten million ton harvest, now more than ever, as we are hitting the 'cyclamates' where it hurts". Terceiro asks "if you people paid for the campaign or not?" Ruiz says no, that luckily it was the American Department of Agriculture. He adds, "We have calculated that it will leave us, free, approximately one million tons of sugar.

The price of sugar has reacted very well, and now a Sugar Conference is to be held in Geneva. You know we are going to get out propaganda now that will state "Only Cuban sugar does not cause cancer". Terceiro laughs, and says "some other problem yes, but not cancer." Ruiz says that the campaign has come at a perfect time for them because they have been struggling for years with the [Illegible], artificial sweeteners[^1], especially in Japan, as they represent approximately one-half million tons. Japan was the country that used it most.

Terceiro says that he has begun to study the famous issue of the Chamber of Commerce. RAMON greets Ruiz and says that he would like to take a book to him and also to talk to him about a personal matter. It is in reference to a recommendation made by Ramon's father for some people in Cuba that are interested in going to Spain. Ramon continues, and says

that he is going to Mexico and Venezuela in December and if he can combine it he would like to go to Cuba also. He says, "It will be the moment for IBERPLAN to become familiar with Cuban reality once and for all". Ruiz says he can bee him next week.

Item #5

Ruiz talks to the man and says "Look, don't be a fool nor so idiotic we have grown up; we now have ten years of revolution, and we are not likely to fall into the kind of provocation that you are trying to do. You can tell that to whoever gives you orders or whoever is re-cording this conversation." The man asks Ruiz who he wants him to tell that to. Ruiz answers "Don't bother me any more. Tell it to the CIA or whoever gives you order, because probably it is the CIA or some other person. The one that gives you orders. Moreover, if you are tapeing this, so am I. I was waiting for your call. You just called a few minutes ago, so don't be an idiot." The man then says, "You think that the CIA gives me orders". Ruiz answers, "Most likely it is the CIA that gives you orders as the only enemy that. Cuba has is the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency, don't

be a fool." The man says, "You are very intelligent",
and Ruiz answers, "It is not a question of intelligence. It
is simply that in ten years we have learned something."
The man then says, "Ten years,eh", and Ruiz answers "Ten
years of revolution, ten years with guns in our hands."
Then the man says, "In this moment do you have a gun in your
hand." Ruiz answers, "Yes, we have a gun in our hands. We
are always waiting for the CIA; morning, noon, and night,
always with guns in our hands." The man: "If you think I
am under orders of the CIA you are a little silly." Ruis
answers "Look, I don't want to continue this conversation.
You are a fool. I, too, an playing the part of a fool,
because the telephone in my embassy is completely inter-
cepted, I imagine. Everyone is listening to us, wo you are
an idiot, and I am silly to talk to you. Therefore,
goodbye sir, and please don't bother me again." Ruiz hangs
up.

B. OSMA-25538, 17 October 1969

1. The AMEDITS have just completed the QUDOZE transcripts for the period 19 September - 13 October 1969. This was the second group of transcripts forwarded the ANEDITS for translation, por our trial period as mentioned in reference A, in order to make them more fully useful to different components at Headquarters. The take from the QUDOZE operation appears very interesting. We noted with interest that AMAUTO-1 discusses freely with his subordinates and privileged visitors subjects of a confidential nature, including matters that have to do with intelligence activities. Some of the discussions offer a number of operational leads which we can follow-up, such as the medical information given on 22 September 1989 in the morning hours.

2. The AMEDITS have suggested that as an aid to help them translate accurately and possibly more rapidly, they would appreciate receiving some original tapes in addition to the transcripts on a trial basis. Then when parts of the transcripts are not understandable to the translator he would have readily available reference for replay.

3. With the next transmittal of the next QUDOZE material, we would appreciate receiving both the transcripts prepared by the station and the actual tapes covering the same period of time. The complete package can then be forwarded to the AMEDITS for their use as mentioned above.

They ad told him that some ne wes waiting te soem,
and now a irl ermesin: UIZ was eting har.
la sots
She is a correspondent of Siempre, or Mexican magasino,
and Ruiz es apren Ion interview for car with Mrs. P
er TALESira). Pasirl asks if she telain that she was
going to Cuba. No, replies Ruin, all she did was to send cor
"background". He asks how if an is carrying her magazine
credentials. Sae aberys dear, sar seys.

Ruiz tells or what she must telk about at the interview,
about sélitics in Spain and its relations with the United
States. Sor must have her cuestiona creared befor-end, and
even the possible replies. She must crier teem ccrefully
as if they were unimportant, but with socialist sense.

Ruiz ex-lains te this fol that what is of interest is
Spain, the superstmcture, the railroads, the banks, tho
nati-nal cranizations, but not the fundamental things,
yet well tied up, all the way to the bone. He says that
people יניםe are soccer Cons, but later you can ask, at do
you think about a sociclist regime in Sprint" The thing is
to stop people in the street, one at a time.

You must take inte secunt that Pace is sunsidered me
of the most brillirat politicians of all times. He is sagricus,
intelligent. If communism hed triumphad here it would have been
the first communist country in the world, and yet neither commun-
ism nor secialiam aes anything to do here while Franco is in.

The girl came from Coacheslovakia, and she talks about
sihat country and of Feland, where she has are bren, but they
have told her a lot about it. Sae depicts life in Czece slovakia
as extremely sad. She had been there in 1963. She comments that
what they did last year in Czecmeslovakia was to set the country
back tremendously, because t wan the first time that people
had taken an interest in anal affairs. Sity was so rotten
test people melled, but the invasion caused such a great shock
that people sunk into a state of apathy from which they are not
coming out. They are scadine for a crisis that not even the
Soviets will be able to stand. People have an interest in their
work. Machinery is far behind. The scale wages is disastrous.

The only people that site. money are the papersians and the nurs18,
whe charge for a visit the equivalent of a worker's monthly salary.
Besties there is tremendous corruption. And so the ware scale, the
old mchinery, and the corruption make life un serable. It must
be taken inte acicunt th t they crushed 200,000 sons and that.
35,000 Party members ere in jail under suspicion. Sefore, people
stood in line to join the Farty; now they tear up their Farty
caris in the street. Disillusionment is encreus. Marxism as con-

received by Lenin or Marx is no longer applicable: it must be
brought up to date and placed in the current scale of technolo-
gical evolution and world reduction. No one in Czechoslovakia
wants to go to the USSR. Everybody, especially the students,
wants to leave for Austria or Germany. The black market is up
to date. The definition is very sad.

Fidel's latest speech, published by Frensa Latina, was
distributed through the Embassy, but they got rid of the
copies and destroyed them. They say that leftist publications
raise whatever they want or whatever interests them, and Fidel's
speech was of no interest to them, since they did not analyze it
thoroughly.

She says that there is a latent revolutionary sentiment
throughout Europe. At the Sorbonne there are some powerful
centers where they compare the performance of the Chinese and
Asiatic outbreaks more than they do the Soviet ones.

This correspondent says that when she gets to Cuba she
is going to visit FIDEL, because there is a trend of distrust
of Cubans throughout Europe, because they think that they receive
Information only through one channel.

Upon hearing these somewhat anti-Soviet remarks on the
part of the correspondent, Ruiz interrupts her and says they
have to be on the side of the Soviets for two reasons: first
from the military and economic point of view, and also because
right or wrong they are on the same side of the fence and must
fight against those on the other side. Cuba has had, and still
has, great discrepancies with Russia, China, and the United
States. In the face of all these discrepancies we are on the
side of communism because we are against capitalism.

Ruiz says that in order to find out if you are a communist
you must ask yourself if you agree with distribution of wealth
and land, equitable distribution of production, respect for man,
nationalization of industry. This is what counts.

At the end this girl says that the only truth is that
unfortunately we Cubans cannot live in peace in any socialist
country. Men like FIDEL and CHE, in a country of seven million
people, going against the whole world all by themselves. You
should see the treatment Fidel gets from the intellectual maga-
zines in the USSR, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.

Ruiz calls NILDA and tells her that this woman comrade is
going to interview Mrs. TAMAKES or TALAYO (ph) and asks Milda
what her personal opinion is about [the lady]. She says she
has only seen her three or four times, and asks in what
sense he means. Ruiz says that this woman comrade is from the

ACTION : See paragraph 5, below

1. Headquarters maintains its high interest in AMAUTO-1 as a long-range, in-place recruitment target. Much of this interest is kept alive by the excellent operational reporting done by Station Madrid over the past year, of which references C and D hereto are good examples.

2. Subject's position and total personality recommend him to us as a high-potential target. He is strongly intellectual and emotionally committed to an ideal. At the same time, he exhibts certain vulnerabilities which could be exploited. We believe, however, that AHAUTO-1 could be approached only in a classic sense: a rationally developed, long-range recruitment culminating in what would be essentially an intellectual and even ideological pitch. This course of action would take time and assets, but we think he would be eminently worth it.

3. First, his access not only is good now but seems destined to improve. Secondly, if he were our agent, he has the wit and the acuity to know what we want and submit information accurately based on requirements. Lastly, he is a strong personality who could be counted on to move flexibly but effectively within the target milieu.

4. As a recruitment target, however, AMAUTO-1 seems to present serious difficulties. He is strong-ainded, opinionated, idealistic, and apparently committed to the revolution. On the other hand, there are certain things about him which could be converted into recruitment vulnerabilities. First among thesо is his apparent belief that the regime (read: the Revolution) is not making the best use of his talents. One cannot tell precisely whether this is the cause or result of his apparent basic emotional instability. During public appearances be displays polished manners and a pro-regime attitude; in private he frequently complains to his subordiantes that he did not ask for a diplomatic position, that he would prefer an industrial job, and that he believes his position to be more a handicap than a promotion. Secondly, he obviously destres personal prestige and luxurious Hving. While these traits do not mean so much in the case of a Cuban as compared to a Soviet or Chinese, hardships and economic mismanagement in Cuba do in fact create a contrast with his basic impulses. Thirdly, his spinal ailment has been diagonsed as incurable. While this may be true, he should realize that further examination by other medical men (while on a training mission in WOLADY, perhaps) could help him considerably. There may even be other vulnerabilities which further target study could expose.

5. We present these thoughts at the same time that we are fully aware of other operational pressures on Madrid's time and assets. Nevertheless, we would appreciate the Station's comments on further development of AMAUTO-1 as an in-place recruitment target. The first need would be the proper access agent, someone with a Jesuit-like intellectual training who can deal with him in the realm of concepts and philosophy as required. In any case, we would like continued target reporting on AMAUTO-1, as your time permits.

MENCROFILM

1.  On 23 September 1969 AMAUTO-1 called an unidentified Spanish woman who resided in Cuba for many years before returning to Spain. AMAUTO-1 noted that he visited the Spanish woman's cousin, identified as Esther CORRIPIO, while he vacationed in PBRUMEN and found everyone in good health. The unidentified Spanish woman asked AMAUTO-1 if there was much food available and the following dialogue began:

AMAUTO-1: Yes, everything is being resolved. But imagine to be free, one must pay a high price and the price must be paid. There is no other way.

WOMAN: What one wants, one must pay.

AMAUTO-1: It is very logical, but look, when one is a servant to the rich, the servant usually lives relatively well, but the servant continues as a servant. However, when one no longer wants to be a servant to the rich, one has to begin saving and the only way there is for the poor to save is to reduce (the intake) of essential foods, change the essential and begin to buy machines and to buy a series of things (cuestiones) and one day, we will become rich together. We can say we are rich when we have resolved all the problems, not only material problems, but spiritual, cultural, that is, when everyone can do and believe as he likes.

WOMAN:
Oh! I don't do anything but talk of Cuba and I adore the country. I have a brother there who is a nurse and he says he is fine.

AMAUTO-1:
Cuba gets into your blood. When I saw Esther she was a little thin, but was in good health.

2. We think the above is another good example of AMAUTO-1's passion for the good life. While he appears patriotic and openly supports the regime, we continue to believe that he would prefer a return to the relative freedoms enjoyed by his countrymen before the start of the revolution.

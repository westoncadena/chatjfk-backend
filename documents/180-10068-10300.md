Dear Tom:

I am pleased to have the opportunity to recommend Carole Hansen Amato for a position on the Select Committee on Assassinations.

I have known Carole since I came to Congress in 1971. She was a member of Congressman John Davis' staff for seven years and was highly valued by him. Since that time she has held an executive position with Congressman Carroll Hubbard and presently works as the legislative secretary to Congressman Bob Jones.

During her nine years on Capitol Hill, Carole has repeatedly proven herself as a reliable and competent worker. She has shown excellent abilities as executive secretary, press assistant and in a legislative capacity. I recommend her highly.

If you should need additional information about Carole, please let me know.

With best regards, I am

Sincerely,

![signature of Dawson Mathis]

EDUCATION: The Washington School for Secretaries

Was employed by the Office of Finance in August, 1975. Duties at that time included handling payroll for approximately 90 Members of Congress. In less than one year, I was promoted to one of only three supervisory positions in the payroll section. I am currently in charge of all payroll matters pertaining to all House Committees, which involves furnishing information on current funding resolutions, providing accurate records of Committee allowances, and distributing monthly records of expenditures for approval by the Chairman of each Committee. In addition, I am responsible for the prompt payment of all federal leases of office space and computer leasing invoices for Members. I am in charge of maintaining complete records of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Intern Program, an allowance furnished each Member of Congress for the employment of two additional employees each year. I also was involved in a complete transition of payroll information from one computer system to the current Financial Management System.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

SECTION C

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper. During most of the period reported on, Subject was concerned with administrative problems associated with the phase-out of the Station. Despite the consequent operational lull, Subject continued to maintain a satisfactory degree of morale in agents assigned him, worked up and implemented realistic training programs, and continued to develop excellent targets studies against the possibility of a policy change. In addition, important information collected locally by Subject on illegal activities of Cuban refugees was of great interest to other agencies offices in the area. Subject was the only Station source of such information which was acquired only because of Subject's ability to maintain rapport with agents, terminated during the period because of the cutback in infiltration operations.

It could also be noted as Subject finishes his long tour at this Station and prepares for his next assignment, that he is a thoroughly professional intelligence officer and is, in many ways, an outstanding one. Technically, he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though his Special Forces experience, an expert on anti-guerrilla warfare as well. Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and rapport with foreign agents. He has an imaginative approach to operations, is resourceful in devising tactics, and determined in carrying out his assignments. He is a definite asset to WOFIRM.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Relate to expert perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence if required for current position. Amplify or explore ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, equipment and funds must be commented on as applicable. If more space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper. During the period under review, Subject has continued to produce at his previous high level and he has planned and executed three intelligence collection operations against a denied area with the two teams under his supervision and direction. His leadership qualities have, to a large degree, enabled him to maintain his commando group morale at a high level under the difficult circumstances of enforced inactivity. Subject's indigenous agents respect him and are willing to follow his instructions to the letter. Subject's seemingly limitless resourcefulness, drive and initiative coupled with his demonstrated proficiency for this type of work mark him as one of the few persons known to the Rater who is ideally suited to this particular type of agent handling on a day-to-day, face-to-face basis.

During the reporting period Subject has committed his four infiltration boat teams on a total of seven operations and excellent results have been realized. He has conducted extensive testing of equipment and techniques in support of Station requirements and Headquarters requests. His reporting after these field tests has shown that his reporting ability has improved to such a degree to warrant a rating of strong in this duty.

He is cost and security conscious and has demonstrated his effectiveness in the use of personnel, equipment and operational funds. Subject has not had the benefit of formal language training and does not have a definitive language capability. In view of his long tenure of field assignments during his career with WOFACT, it is recommended he be given.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Subject has been under my supervision for approximately 6 months. During this period he has shown an outstanding proficiency in the supervision of his Commando Group. He is responsible for the logistical support, maintenance, planning and operations of the group and must also maintain their motivation and moral. As a result of the stand-down in PM activities at this Station, one of his major duties has been keeping his group motivated and happy. Subject has performed these tasks in a very professional manner; he has shown strong leadership qualities and a definite ability to adapt to difficult and frustrating changes in the operational climate. Subject has had the additional duty of handling an FI Agent for the Station. He has spent long hours on this activity and has shown that he is fully capable of broadening his scope of activities to other fields besides the supervision of a commando group. He is cost and security conscious and has shown that he is effective in the use of personnel, space, equipment and operational funds.

Continuation of FITNESS REPORT, Section D:

Subject is a well-qualified para-military specialist, who has fully mastered the tools of his trade. Subject applies all of his para-military knowledge in the performance of his current duties as the senior outside case officer for a thirty-man commando group, which is capable of carrying out a variety of different mission. Those missions include caching operations, sabotage raids, tactical intelligence reconnaissance activities and contingency missions related to war plans. Subject is at his best in dealing with men and military equipment. Subject's major weakness is in records management and reports writing. Despite this minor weakness, Subject's over-all performance warrants an evaluation of Proficient.

Subject has the potential to train and operationally exploit para-military forces in units which have a T/O strength of not more than 60 men. Subject could command a conventional military formation at the battalion level. Subject is capable of mounting counter-insurgency operations with the use of forces up to battalion strength..

Subject's work comes to the attention of the Reviewing Officer on a bi-weekly basis.

Subject's future assignments should be in the para-military field. If Subject is to remain in operations in Latin America, he must be given an opportunity to study Spanish on a formal basis.

SECTION E

NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made to employee for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for development and for assuming greater responsibilities. Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and E and provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

As a former military officer, Subject is hard working and abundantly sincere in his efforts to fight Communism. His performance since Aug 1961 has not been at the top level of his capabilities for several reasons, not all of which are within his ability to overcome. Subject has had little clandestine training, and is therefore not always able to comprehend the intangible factors which prevent, delay and cancel operations. A further reason is the absence of military law as a basis for discipline formis men. Still another reason is the directive for only limited action with which he has had to live since August. This is merely to say that in a period of policy formation when the action forces have had to be held in limbo, he has not been at his best. Subject's dealings with his agents have in turn been affected by his own frustrations. His inability to rationalize situations has resulted in obtuse explanations to them which have made them harder to handle. His reluctance to put things on paper has detracted from his performance and denied him the clarifying process which reporting provides. His security consciousness has been similarly affected by his frustrations. Subject is in need of training in tradecraft and PM operations. His basic qualifications for PM Case Officer work are such that he can, with training, do a much better job. This combined with a program of concentrated action would undoubtedly bring out the best in him, which should be of real value to the Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Grayston L. Lynch

REFERENCE: Mr. Lynch's memorandum to Director of Personnel, dated 22 June 1971.

1. On the basis of what I can recall from the time I was connected with the Bay of Pigs activity and my years with WH Division thereafter, Mr. Lynch has stated his tasks correctly.

2. Since the issue is whether Mr. Lynch's service in Miami could be considered equivalent to that of an Operations Officer overseas, the following might be considered:

Mr. Lynch had to operate clandestinely.

He used pseudonyms, safesites for meetings, non-official cover.

He handled, trained and dispatched agents. He debriefed them. He worked with them side by side.

He worked long, irregular hours (days and nights) under unusual pressures and at personally inconvenient and unappealing sites.

Mr. Lynch was, during the Bay of Pigs period at least, in real personal danger. (Our case officers abroad do not often face such situations nor do they have to display such courage.)

3. In summary, Mr. Lynch's tasks were professionally and personally more demanding than those of many of our Operations Officers abroad. He had to apply clandestine techniques and concepts in a highly volatile and difficult operational climate. To admit him to the CIA Retirement System seems justified.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Approval of Mr. Grayston L. Lyze as a Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

REFERENCE : HR 20-50

1.  It is strongly recommended that Mr. Grayston L. Lynch be approved as a participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System.

2.  It is the opinion of the Special Operations Division that the duties performed by Mr. Lynch from the time he entered on duty in February 1961 until early 1968 meet the spirit and intent of the criteria for "qualifying service" as defined HR 20-50b. The lone exception to these criteria is that Mr. Lynch was not "abroad" during the time involved except on a sporadic basis. This exception, however, was due completely to the geographical location of the area of operations. This location made it uniquely propitious to have Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a domestic base. There is no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's service was in the conduct and support of covert operations which required continuing practice of security and tradecraft procedures and which included, from time to time, hazards to his life and health. it is also believed that Mr. Lynch would be at a disadvantage in cotaining other employ- ment because of the sensitivity of his past service as well as the dearth of requirements for his peculiar background, skills and knowledge.

3.  On the basis of the above and Mir. Lynch's unique personal record, it is believed that his service cring the described period is certainly equivalent to if not in excess of the requirements for "creditable service abroad" and that if it bad not been for a geographical accident, this service would have been performed as


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

part of an assignment abroad within the fullest meaning of the definition contained in the referent regulation. Therefore, approval of Mr. Lynch's request for designation as a participant in the CIARDS on the basis of service performed between 1961 and 1968 is not only strongly recommended but is requested as the grant of an entitlement fully earned by a very deserving employee.

EYES UNLY
SECRET

Mr. Grayston L. Lynchis a Career Agent who entered on duty into the Agency in February 1961 and served in New Orleans, Louisiana and Key West, Florida preparing WII Agent assets for operational assignments. In March 1961 he left Key West Florida aboard a covert Agency vessel for Nicaragua where he assisted in the preparation of Agency vessels and assets scheduled for operations into Cuba. in April 1961, he left Nicaragua on a Agency vessel to participate in the landing operations in the Bay of Pigs, Cuba. He was involved in armed action both at sea and at shore during the four days of the invasion attempt and, from direct Instructions from the DCI engaged in series of covert landings and opera- tions into Cuba for several days following the invasion Landing. For this action Mr. Lynch received the Intelligence Star. Mr. Lynch spbsequently served as a paramilitary operations officer at Miami, Florida until approximately June 1968. During this period he participated in mimerous clandestine activities including agent training, parachute training, weapons training, planned and directed 115 actual operations into Cuba.

In the course of these carlier operational assignments, Mr. Lynch developed a psychosis which will not permit him to travel by air at ail nor by overland means for any lengthy period of time.

This has resulted in a medical hold being placed on Mr. Lynch for any overseas assignment FCS or TDY. Since he is uniquely a field operations officer there are literally no departmental duties to which he can be assigned. Since there is no suitable assignment available for Mr. Lynch it is necessary to terminate Mr. Lynch's contract as a Career Agent. Since he is eligible for Involuntary Retirement under CIARDS, Mr. Lynch has made application for retirement effective 10 September 1971. In view of Mr. Lynch's age, specialized skills, long service in a uniquely Aersitive area, and peculiar contribution to the Agency's mission it is believed that a termination bonus at the time of his retirement is fully warranted.

Mr. Lynch is currently the equivalent of a GS-14, step 5 with an anmmal salary of $23, 591. The proposed $10,000 termination bonus represents, therefore, less than 12% of his annual salary or approximately 5 months pay. In connection with this, it should be noted that if he were being termina- ted rather than retiring, he would be entitled by virtue of the provisions of his contract to 90 days notice which would equal approximately $6,000 at his current rate of pay in salary alone. Additioral frizze benefits would increase this figure.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, SOD/SS/Personnel

SUBJECT : Mr. Grayston Lynch

4 AUG 1970

1. Assuming no interruptions or changes of assignment or status in the interim, Mr. Lynch will complete his currently scheduled Spanish language training in mid-April 1971. Between now and then it is understood that he will--on his own initiative and with whatever assistance and encouragement we can properly provide--make an offort to overcome his phobia of flying and thereby, in due course, qualify medically for TDY or PCS overseas field duty.

2. In view of Mr. Lynch's past history, however, we cannot assume that he will be successful or will even actively press to overcome his problem. In spite of his career agent status and his operational performance (Intelligence Star), we cannot, in all conscience, carry him on SOD contract rolls indefinitely in an unproductive capacity. He has completed all of the advanced and refresher operations training necessary to qualify for assignment now. He has not adapted well nor has he been receptive to the kinds of headquarters duty assignments open to him. He is a field paramilitary officer,

3. It is prudent, therefore, to begin contingency planning now for his appropriate retirement and outplacement into a job which will offer him both security and personal satisfaction. His Spanish language training should enlarge his horizons and opportunities, We can predict he will not, at least at first, take at all kindly to the idea of retirement and relinquishing his Agency association. He is emotionally involved, and identifies himself as an Agency career field operations officer.

4. Please acquaint C/CSPS and DDP/JO with the background of this case, and together with them begin now to plan for this contingency.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Retirement Anmity
Mr. Grayston Lynch

2 NOV 1970

1. Retirement Operations Division of the Office of Personnel (Linda Birch) provided the following computations for a proposed annuity for Mr. Grayston Lynch if he retired on the dates indicated. These figures were computed on 30 October 1970 and were based on the following:

|                                               | 31 Dec 1970      | 30 April 197      |

| AGE (DOB: 14 June 1923)                       | 47 years, 6 mts. | 47 years. 10 mts. |
| CREDITABLE SERVICE (Including S/L)            | 31 years. 8 mts. | 32 years          |
| HIGH AVERAGE (3 Years)                        | $19.655          | $20.261           |
| BASIC ANNUITY: Per Annum                      | $ 9.979          | 10.478            |
| Per Month                                     | 832              | 873               |
| BASIC ANNUITY REDUCED FOR SURVIVOR: Per Annum | 9.251            | 9,700             |
| Per Month                                     | 771              | 808               |
| SURVIVOR ANNUITY: Per Annum                   | 5,488            | 5.763             |
| Per Month                                     | 457              | 480               |

2. The above annuity would be recomputed when Mr. Lynch becomes 62 years old. This recomputation is required to drop off post 1956 military service which applies to Social Security eligibility. Subject has no choice in this matter if he is eligible for Social Security benefits. If he is NOT eligible for Social Security. benefits then the military service will remain creditable toward his Civil Service retirement annuity. The recomputed aanuity would be as follows:

|                                     |         |         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| BASIC ANNDITY: Per Annum            | $ 8.695 | $ 9.145 |
| Per Month                           | 725     | 762     |
| BASIC ANNUITY REDUCED FOR SURVISOR: |         |         |
| Per Annum                           | 5,096   | 8.507   |
| Per Month                           | 675     | 708     |


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

SURVIVOR ANNULTY: Per Annum $ 4.782 $ 8.030
Per Month 399 419

3. It should be noted that the entire annuity at either time is reduced 2 % per year for each year Mr. Lynch is under 53 years of age. This amounts to a total reduction of approximately 15%.

1. Mr. Lynch reported to C/SOD/Pers for interview on 5 December 1968. JMWAVE officials had notified him of the medical decision and the purpose of this visit to arrange for a six month interim assignment period while he undergoes appropriate treatment in Miami. We discussed the terms of the agreement which was made part of memorandum of agreement and was signed by Mr. Lynch and C/SOD/Pers.

2. Mr. Lynch visited WH Division for discussions regarding the interim assignment with Dave Philips, Cuba Desk. According to Lynch there was some difference of opinion about the job at this point as to whether he'd be working for JMCOBRA or for Cuba Desk. He discussed this again with WH officials who he says agreed that he would work on a project for Mr. Philips unless Mr. Esterline had something specific he needed him to do. A message was to be sent out to this effect by WH Division.

3. Mr. Redmond of Agent Panel and Mr. Pollock SAS/OP were advised of status of this case but did not need to see Mr. Lynch unless ho wished an interview. Pete Gaughan and Dr. Robinson of OMS were contacted and Dr. Robinson provided the names of three cleared consultants in Miami area for Mr. Lynch's referral. Mr. Lynch had a brief interview with Mr. Holcomb to let him know that arrangements for the six month interim assignment had gone well, he understood the terms of the agreement, and hoped to return in six months qualified for full duty including overseas and flying. He then took care of his accountings in SOD/E&F and departed for the drive back to Florida.

4. Mr. Lynch appeared to be in good spirits on this visit. He seemed to understand fully the terms of the six month agreement and expressed appreciation for being given this period of time to prove himself qualified for continued employment. However, he was left with no doubt of our intentions to terminate his contract at the end of the six month

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

SUBJECT: Temporary Assignment -
Mr. Grayston Lynch

1. As a result of his recent fitness for duty physical examination, it was determined that Mr. Lynch is qualified only for domestic assignments not involving flying. This decision means that Mr. Lynch is not currently qualified to perform the duties required of him under the IUJEWEL Program. These duties involve primarily overseas assignments and require flying both as the normal means of transportation to and from areas of assignment and as an integral part of his job concerned with training and conduct of airborne operations.

2. Since Mr. Lynch is not qualified to perform the duties required of his position at this time or for the indefinite future, three courses of action have been considered as follows:

a. Termination of contract under the 90-days notice clause of his contract.

b. Initiation of action for disability rotirement.

c. Approval of a 6-month domestic (temporary) assignment while Mr. Lynch pursues appropriate treatment to determine whether his current disability is temporary.

3. In recognition of Mr. Lynch's long period of dedicated service to the Federal Government and this Agency, it has been agreed to offer him the 6-month interim assignment as per paragraph 2.(c) above under the following conditions:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 61

a. That an appropriate domestic assignment is available.

b. That he pursues appropriate treatment during the 6-month assignment period.

c. That Mr. Lynch report for another medical evaluation at the end of the 6-month assignment to determine whether he is qualified for full duty including overseas assignments involving flying.

4. It is further agreed that if, at the end of the 6-month period, Mr. Lynch is not found qualified for full duty including overseas assignments involving flying, action will be initiated to terminate his contract employment as in paragraph 2.(a) or (b) above.

Dear Gray,

We have received a call from Training about a tape recorder which they believe you still may have - a small cassette type which was issued to you while you were in language training.

If you still have the recorder, would you please ship it to Betty Weyland at the above address. If you turned it in, would you let me know when and where so I can pass on the information to Training?

Hope you are enjoying life and lots of sunshine.

Sincerely,

Darold Aldridge

SUBJECT: Mr. Grayston L. Lynch
Contact Report

1. Mr. Lynch called to advise that he was still in the local area and ask if he could pick up his annuity check and change his forwarding address and banking instructions, as he was no longer going to go to Tampa, Florida. He said he was buying part interest in a boat and had rented an apartment in Key West, Florida and would be living and working there. In this respect he wanted to know if he should not have a change in his cover status from "open" to "under cover" because of his "new" location.

2. Mr. Frank Stewart was advised of the change of Mr. Lynch's plans and his inquiry regarding a change in cover status. Mr. Stewart (SQ/Security) subsequently advised that Mr. Lynch would remain "open" and that he, Mr. Stewart would call Mr. Lynch and brief him on the subject.

3. Inquiry on Mr. Lynch's behalf into the other questions led to the following:

a. Mr. Paul Seidol, OP/Retirement Division, the officer who processed Mr. Lynch's retirerent, is the appropriate local contact for Mr. Lynch to have to handle any problem with his retirerent or his annuity payment. In this respect Mr. Seidel suggested that his telephone number be given to Mr. Lynch for this and future inquiries, so long as Mr. Lynch was in the local area. Otherwise, Mr. Lunch has been given correspondence instructions. Mr. Seidol's telephone mumber was then given telephonically to Mr. Lynch with instructions to call for arrangements regarding his annuity check, banking instructions, change of address, etc. Mr. Lynch acknowledged this instruction.

Mr. Irving C. Devuono
Dear Mr. Devuono:

Reference is made to your contract with the United States Government, as represented by the Contracting Officer, effective 1 November 1967.

It has been mutually agreed by both parties that said contract will be terminated on or about 10 September 1971, at which time you will be involuntarily retired, due to the absence of any immediate or foreseeable work assignment for which you qualify.

You are herein authorized a taxable terminal payment of $10,000 to assist you in resettling and retraining for another occupation. Said payment will be payable as of the effective date of your retirement.

You are aware that said terminal payment was not an original part of your contract but has been authorized solely because of the unique circumstances associated with your past service, coupled with the circumstances associated with your premature retirement.

You are reminded of the contents of paragraph thirteen (13) of said contract which read as follows:

You will be required to keep forever secret this contract and all information which you may obtain by reason hereof (unless released in writing by the Government from such obligation), with full knowledge that violation of such secrecy may subject you to criminal prosecution under the Espionage Laws, dated 25 June 1948, as amended, and other applicable laws and regulations."

SUBJECT: Mr. Grayson L. Lynch File

Mr. Lynch telephonod today and advised that he did not want his termination bonus to be held for payment in Calendar Year 1972 as agreed upon, but would like to have it payed at the time of his retirement. I pointed out that this would result in a good tax bite, Mr. Gray stated that he would need the money at they time of retirement and would just have to sustain the additional tax.

Mr. Lynch also asked if he could obtain an advance on his salary of about $500 as his salary checks were mailed to a bank in Florida and he had exhausted his supply of EER checks because he had tought he would have left the area by now. He was advised that this could be done but that it would take a memo from him to the Director of Finance. He stated that he would come to the office on 16 July to prepare the memo. He should be sent to C/SCD/BGF to initiate the memo and the action to obtain the advance on his salary.

24 JUN 1971

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT : Recommendation for Approval of
Mr. Grayston L. Lynch as a Participant
In the CIA Retirement and Disability System

REFERENCE : HR 20-50

1. It is strongly recommended that Mr. Grayston L. Lynch
   be approved as a participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability
   System.

2. It is the opinion of the Special Operations Division that
   the duties performed by Mr. Lynch from the time he entered on duty
   in February 1961 until early 1968 meet the spirit and intent of the
   criteria for "qualifying service" as defined in HR 20-50b. The lone
   exception to these criteria is that Mr. Lynch was not "abroad"
   during the time involved except on a sporadic basis. This exception,
   however, was due completely to the geographical location of the area
   of operations. This location made it uniquely propitious to have
   Mr. Lynch assigned to and work out of a domestic base. There is
   no question, however, that Mr. Lynch's service was in the conduct
   and support of covert operations which required continuing practice
   of security and tradecraft procedures and which included, from
   time to time, hazards to his life and health. It is also believed
   that Mr. Lynch would be at a disadvantage in obtaining other employ-
   ment because of the sensitivity of his past service as well as the
   dearth of requirements for his peculiar background, skills and
   knowledge.

3. On the basis of the above and Mr. Lynch's unique per-
   sonal record, it is believed that his service during the described
   period is certainly equivalent to if not in excess of the requirements
   for "creditable service abroad" and that if it had not been for a
   geographical accident, this service would have been performed as

part of an assignment abroad within the fullest meaning of the defini-
tion contained in the referent regulation. Therefore, approval of
Mr. Lynch's request for designation as a participant in the CLARINS
on the basis of service performed between 19el and 1968 is not only
strongly recommended but is requested as the grant of an entitloinent.
fully earned by a very deserving employee.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Request for Designation as a Participant in CIARDS--Mr. Grayston L. Lynch

1. It is requested that domestic service reflected in the following paragraphs be approved as qualifying service for the CIARDS and that I be designated as a participant in the system.

2. I entered on duty with the Agency on 10 February 1961. I was sent TDY immediately to New Orleans, Louisiana and from there to Key West, Florida, to prepare WH Division agent assets for operational missions. On 28 March 1961 I departed Key West, Florida aboard a covert Agency ship bound for Nicaragua where I engaged in the preparation of Agency vessels and assets scheduled for operations into Cuba. On 13 April 1961 I departed Nicaragua via an Agency vessel for the 17 April 1961 landing operation in the Bay of Pigs, Cuba. I was assigned as the Case Officer for the Agency command ship, Cuban Brigade Headquarters, and the Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) element. I participated in armed action both at sea and on shore during the four days of the invasion attempt and, per direct instructions from the DCI, engaged in a series of covert landings and operations into Cuba for several days following the invasion landing. I returned to Headquarters on 29 April 1961

3. In August 1961 I was assigned PC3 to JMWAVE at Miami, Florida as a Paramilitary Operations Officer. From my arrival in August 1961 until July 1965 I served under commercial cover outside the station, intermittently using my home and various safehouses as "Ad hoc" offices. All contact with the station was by telephone and/or personal meetings prearranged with station personnel. These personal contacts were either at my home, in safehouses, or at other meeting places deemed appropriate. During this period I was responsible for the recruitment, training, administration and operational direction of a very large group of Agents. This entailed numerous clandestine meetings, both day and night, with these Agents. Since they were in various stages of training, assessment or preparation for an operation and were located throughout Dade and Monroe counties in

Florida, I was required to drive an average of 3000 miles per month to provide the necessary handling and support. The major training exercises were as follows:

a. Threes black flights to ISOLATION for periods of one to three weeks duration during which time I was required to remain in the black training areas as handler for the Agents.

b. One three day trip to Lake Worth, Florida during which I conducted the ground phase of parachute training for 26 Agents and arranged for civilian instructors and planes for two parachute jumps per man.

c. Two black flights to Camp Mckall, North Carolina to conduct parachute training for 36 Agents, during which time, as Chief Instructor, I made two parachute jumps..

d. Two black flights to the Ranger Training Center at Eglin AFB, Florida for additional parachute, commando and guerilla warfare training for 38 Agents. Both trips were of two weeks duration each and again, I made two parachute jumps.

e. Four black flights to Fort Stewart, Georgia for training in weapons and tactics for 16 Agents. Training was conducted with all weapons from the .15 calibre pistol up to and including the 4.2 inch mortar. Demolition and sabotage training including night and day tactical exercises using live ammunition and explosives were also conducted, Each exercise lasted from five to 15 days.

f. Eight training exercises from three to seven days duration each were conducted in and around the Everglades National Park and the Marquesas Keys in Florida.

g. Over 70 mission rehearsals of two or three days duration conducted in the Florida Keys.

4. In addition to the above training exercises I planned and directed 115 actual operations into Cube during this period. This involved the isolation of a five to 25 nman team in a safehouse for three days to two weeks preparing for an operation and remaining with them day and night until they were launched. It also involved receiving the team at the conclusion of the mission and again holding them in a safehouse for a two day debriefing period.

5. In 1965 I set up an office in Ferrine, Florida, under commercial cover, to administer the Agent group. I remained in this office conducting operations and training as before until April 1966. My office was moved into the JM/WAVE station at that time, but I remained under commercial cover and my duties continued to be the same.

6. During the time I was assigned to JM/WAVE I was required to participate in numerous voyages aboard Agency ships into international waters. Many of these were near to end into denied waters. I was also required to participate in several search and rescue aircraft flights of long duration over international water, near and into denied areas.

7. It is my belief that my activities and duties from August 1961 to June 1968 were of the types normally found only in overseas clandestine activities for which the five year CLARDS "creditable service abroad" requirement was intended. I am available for further explanation or clarification if any of the above information is required, or if confirmation of my service by other Agency personnel is needed, I submit the following names of knowledgeable individuals:

a. Gerald Droller, DDP/NSP
b. Robert Ortman, WH/COG
c. George Freuch, SOD/GB
d. William Broe, C/WH

8. In view of the facts presented above, I request to be designated a participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System and will apply for disability retirement when my participation is approved.

MINOR MEMUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Mr. Grayston L. Lynch

As of 29 May 1971 Mr. Lynch was accredited with the following leave balances:

Annual Leave - 376 hours

Sick Leave - 340 hours

If Mr. Lynch's application for CIA/DS and his application for Disability Retirement under CIA/RDS were all processed and awaiting approval, he could go on sick leave as of close of business 2 July to exhaust all sick leave and then all excess annual leave prior to retirement. He would retire under these circumstances, if approved as of COB 6 October 1971. (This date was computed by payroll based on the following assumptions; 1). He would take no leave between now and 2 July, 2). He earned 26 days leave per year, 3). He had a leave ceiling of 360 hours.

Darold D. Aldridge
AC/SOD/Personnel

17 June 1971
1st Indorsement

Mr. Lynch will not be permitted to process all the paperwork for his pending retirement and then depart the area. Retirement Operations Division/CP will not accept his application for CIA/DS retirement until he has actually been accepted into CIA/DS, nor will they initiate a request to the OIS for a medical survey until an application has been submitted for Disability retirement, nor will they submit a request for medical survey under Civil Service and then convert to CIA/RDS. Concurrently, OS will not review their requirements on Mr. Lynch prior to receiving a request from ROD/OP. Since neither Retirement Ops Div/AOP nor OS will take action pending resolution of Mr. Lynch's participation in CIA/DS I advised him we would be unable to hit the 2 July target date to commence his leave in preparation for retirement. It was stated that

this was all right with him. Therefore, I am scheduling the following
procedures:

As of 25 June 1971, Mr. Lynch's signed application for participation
in CLJUS, form 3100 and Service Agreement accompanied by AC/SOD
recommendation was hand carried to CSIG for Hurni action. AC/SOD also
added a note on the routing sheet requesting that the request receive
every consideration on an expedite basic.

When the above application is approval, Mr. Lynch should be scheduled
for a retirement interview with Mr. Paul Seidel to make application for
Disability retirement and be scheduled for any physical examination or
medical interview required.

Following the above, Mr. Lynch could commence his leave and proceed
to Florida pending the outcome of his application for Disability Retirement.
When approved he would continue to utilize his sick leave and excess annual
leave until it was expired. The retirement would then become effective.

In an interview with Mr. Lynch on 15 June 1971, the C/SOD/SS and
the AC/SOD/Pers discussed the possibility of obtaining on a Termination
Bonus in the amount of $10,000 payable on retirement with Mr. Lynch. This
was because of Mr. Lynch's unique situation regarding his service and
career with the Agency. It was pointed out that this was definitely not
the normal prozectureskaks procedure, but was based purely on Mr. Gray's
status as a Career Agent and the unusual aspects of his termination. It
was agreed that although Mr. Gray would become eligible for this bonus,
if we were able to get it approved, as of the date of his retirement, we
would not make payment until Calendar Year 1972 in order to give
Mr. Gray benefit of the tax break resulting from the delayed payment.
Mr. Gray agreed to all of the above provisions without equivocation.

Mr. Gray was instructed to maintain constant contact with Maritime
Branch - at least check with them twice a day to ascertain if there were
messages or requirements for his presence or appointments scheduled for
him. He agreed to this as he does not have a phone at home and there is
no other positive means to contact him, SOD/Personnel is to leave any
message necessary for him with the Secretary/Maritime Branch for delivery.
(If no other contact possible, try informally through Jerry Sohl.)

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

- weeks and b months of instruction in Spanish. However, *this is*
  *not a formal evaluation.*

*Mr. S*** had been doing a sort of bastardized Spanish for *X* years and was not able to communicate quite well in it, albeit very ungrammatically.  He understood most of what was said and a Fair percentage of it was a pain.  This was a aim as unwarranted feeling of confidence in *his abilities.* For when it came to grammar, he met great difficulty, and to such an extent, that his slow rate of progress was a hinderance to the more advanced students.  He was dropped back after 3 months to a beginning class.  After *A*, the same thing happened again, and in order *that this course of his, we had him dropped from it and given special help by *A.* He was persistent in his rather unsuccessful effort to improve. He was a very active part in social activities and as approached, but *his results* were too few for the time.  He leaves *A*'s to his future efforts.  He is very *nice*, as woman and *his* *children.*

FOREIGN LANGUAGE APTITUDE TESTING RESULTS

NAME:
DATE:

Since many things other than aptitudes enter into the determination of training course performance, in any class of students there will usually be some whose performance will be better than would be expected from their test scores, Just as there will likely be some whose performance is poorer than expected. STRENGTH OF MOTIVATION, PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH A FOREIGN LANGUAGE, and other factors should be considered in selecting people for language training and in interpreting language training results. For example, the number of languages previously studied or learned and the amount of academic and non-academic language-learning experience are factors not measured by the tests but are indicative of probable success in learning a foreign language. Whether such experience was in the same language as the one to be studied or in a different one is, of course, an additional relevant factor.

The rating received by the above individual is circled below:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Subject: Mr. Grayston Lynch

It was determined that no action would be taken on this case until after the first of the year (1971) at which time Mr. Lynch will be advised by C/SOD/Personnel that he will be made available for a suitable operational assignment, most likely overseas, unless he opts to apply for disability retirement.

If Mr. Lynch opts to apply for disability retirement he will be continued in his present assignment pending approval of his retirement.

If Mr. Lynch chooses to be shopped for a field assignment, SOD will initiate action to locate such a position. When found, Mr. Lynch will be processed for the assignment. Should he fail to be medically approved, action will be taken to obtain his retirement for medical reasons. Should an assignment not be forthcoming by April 1971, a medical disposition for overseas planning purposes (General) will be requested.

The purpose of the above scheduled action is to either find a suitable assignment for Mr. Lynch or to effect his disability retirement on either a voluntary or involuntary basis.

To the unstructor, the lion grade in section. I was due to a lack of motivation and without on the part of Mr. Dynek. He said he appeared to have an attitude that less course content would come automatically, and it wasn't necessary to study. Some after some basic facts of the course must be learned early to successfully complete the course. And even after were permite more repeated each day, but Mr. Dynek was unable to answer questions concerning them.

GRADE : 14 NO. OF STUDENTS : 12

EOD DATE : Feb 61

COURSE OBJECTIVES - Content and Methods

The course aims to provide a description of counterintelligence in the covert and clandestine warfare of today in both friendly and enemy areas. To do so, a brief description of the intent, purpose, and dynamics of espionage, subversion and counterintelligence as practiced by the major enemy forces is provided and this is contrasted to the spectrum of counterintelligence activities of the United States of America and of allied countries. To support counterintelligence missions levied upon the Agency, a review of the cooperation and coordination and exchange of information and services between cooperating services is provided. Counterintelligence is then related to all other Clandestine Service operations and its place as a part thereof is demonstrated. To provide the student with a framework within which to work, the organization of the Agency for counterintelligence is also provided.

ACHIEVEMENT RECORD

This is a certificate of attendance. Since this course is a survey course, it does not attempt to qualify the student as a counterintelligence operations officer and no evaluation is made of individual performance.

TRAINING EVALUATION
NAME : Grayston Lynch
OFFICE : SOD
DATES OF COURSE: 30 March - 10 April 1970

COURSE OBJECTIVES

1.  This course is designed primarily for either a case officer who expects to guide and manage an audio surveillance operation, or for those who have related responsibilities, i.e., desk officer and physical security officers.

2.  Although the course provides a basic familiarization with audio devices the primary emphasis is on the collection of target data, planning the operation, locating a "listening post", supporting the entry, exploiting "the take", and the orderly termination of the operation once it has outlived its usefulness, in short, managing an audio operation from inception to termination.

3.  The course provides a basic knowledge of "quick plant" devices, to permit the exploitation of certain targets of opportunity. The same devices could be concealed and used for "carry in" devices.

4.  Finally, the course provides instruction in the timely scholastic maintenance of listening post equipment, so that an operation can continue without the constant presence of an audio technician.

EVALUATION

1. The students met objectives of the course.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Special Operations Division

SUBJECT : Maritime Branch Nomince for the Special
Operations Division's liistorical Program

REFERENCE : Chief, Special Operations Division Memo-
randum dated 24 December 1969. Subject:
Historical Program

1. Considering the current manpower shortages and relative inexperience in the Maritime Eranch, I recommend that only one quarter man year be devoted to the Historical Program in calendar years 1970-71. If and when officers report on board who have the uniquo or special knowledge required to write histories, then these personnel will bo assigned this task and a subsequent increase in man years available will be made.

2. I nominato Mr. Grayston L. Lynch to write his- tories in CY 1970-71. This officer combines the unique knowledge of first hand operational experience with the qualities of a good narrative writer.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement at work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and care consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper. During most of the period reported on, Subject was concerned with administrative problems associated with the phase-out of the Station. Despite the consequent operational lull, Subject continued to maintain a satisfactory degree of morale in agents assigned him, worked up and implemented realistic training programs, and continued to develop excellent targets studies against the possibility of a policy change. In addition, important information collected locally by Subject on illegal activities of Cuban refugees was of great interest to other agencies offices in the area. Subject was the only Station source of such information which was acquired only because of Subject's ability to maintain rapport with agents, terminated during the period because of the cutback in infiltration operations.

It could also be noted as Subject finishes his long tour at this Station and prepares for his next assignment, that he is a thoroughly professional intelligence officer and is, in many ways, an outstanding one. Technically, he is an expert on infiltration tactics and, though his Special Forces experience, an expert on anti-guerrilla warfare as well. Just as important, is his ability to gain respect and rapport with foreign agents. He has an imaginative approach to operations, is resourceful in devising tactics, and determined in carrying out his assignments. He is a definite asset to COFIRM.

Consider ONLY affectiveness in performance of that duty. All employees with supervisory.responsibilities MUST be rated on their ability to supervise (Indicate number of employees supervised).

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section 8 to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on, if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

During the period under review, Subject has continued to produce at his previous high level and he has planned and executed three intelligence collection operations against a denied area with the two teams under his supervision and direction. His leadership qualities have, to a large degree, enabled him to maintain his commando group morale at a high level under the difficult circumstances of enforced inactivity. Subject's indigenous agents respect him and are willing to follow his instructions to the letter. Subject's seemingly limitless resourcefulness, drive and initiative coupled with his demonstrated proficiency for this type of work mark him as one of the few persons known to the Rater who is ideally suited to this particular type of agent handling on a day-to-day, face-to-face basis.

During the reporting period Subject has committed his four infiltration boat teams on a total of seven operations and excellent results have been realized. He has conducted extensive testing of equipment and techniques in support of Station requirements and Headquarters requests. His reporting after these field tests has shown that his reporting ability has improved to such a degree to warrant a rating of strong in this duty.

He is cost and security conscious and has demonstrated his effectiveness in the use of personnel, equipment and operational funds. Subject has not had the benefit of formal language training and does not have a definitive language capability. In view of his long tenure of field assignments during his career with WOFACT, it is recommended he be given.

that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section B. However, the nature, source, purpose or dispo
sition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of
certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of
specific duties will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.

He is responsible for the logistical support, maintenance, planning and operations of the group and must also maintain their motivation and moral.

Subject has had the additional duty of handling an FI Agent for the Station. He has spent long hours on this activity and has shown that he is fully capable of broadening his scope of activities to other fields besides the supervision of a commando group.

SPECIAL NOTE

Fitness Reports must be prepared with due regard for security considerations. For example, in the case of administrative and support personnel and others whose duties do not in themselves reveal sources of information and methods of operation, it is normally expected that a complete and realistic statement of specific duties may be reported in Section B. However, the nature, source, purpose or disposition of information or operations will not be included. On the other hand, the position titles and description of specific duties of certain other employees may jeopardize security and should not be fully reported on this form. In these cases, general statements of specific duties will be included in Section B indicating the level of responsibility.

BRIEF FOR THE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

Graysten L. Lynch, Captain, U. S. Army (retired), Career Agent,
DDP/CA Staff, GS-13 Equivalent.

Recommended for Intelligence Star

Captain Lynch was employed by another government agency prior to the Cuban invasion. During the preparations for the Cuban invasion, Captain Lynch was granted Agent status with CIA with the understanding he would return to his parent agency at the completion of the project. The-Board recommends that he be awarded the Intelligence Star for his activities under five on 16-17 April 1961. He personally led the beach reconnaissance party on the night of 16 April and succeeded in placing beach markers in preparation for the landing. On 17 April, his ship was beseiged by an air attack. He was successful in leading the convoy to a point off the beach, during which time gunfire from his vessel destroyed two of the attacking aircraft. During the period 22-24 April, Captain Lynch led a team of three back to the objective area and rescued nine survivors of the invasion forces.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/WH/B&F

SUBJECT: Federal Income Taxes
Irving G. DEVUONO (P), Contract Employee

1. During his recent visit to Headquarters, DEVUONO raised questions concerning his Federal income tax returns and interest allegedly due for income received during calendar year 1962. He stated he had filed covert returns for 1961 and 1963 and that he would file a covert return for 1964. He had previously been advised that he owed interest on his 1962 income in the amount of $165.54. He stated that this was not correct as the verbal instruc- tions given him b. Mr. Robert Bladergroen of OGC were followed by him when he filed his 1962 covert return. According to DEVUONO, Bladergroen discussed tax matters with him during a visit to JMWAVE sometime in April 1963.

2. As I was not previously acquainted with the facts in DEVUONO's case, I did not attempt to judge it nor to promise him that it could be resolved to his satisfaction. I did, however, inform him we would investigate the matter and would officially advise the Station of the decision. Therefore, please initiate appropriate action with the covert tax people and the Office of General Counsol (Mr. Bladergroen) to set this matter at rest. Informally, Bladergroen Informs me that he recalls his conversations with DEVUONO and that DEVUONO either did not understand his instructions or chose to disregard therra. I believe Mrs. O'Leary and at least one other member of her staff with whon) DEVUONO consulted during his visit can assist in resolving this matter. I to not find any correspondence in his Personnel Folder other than a copy of a cable, IN 57726, dated 12 June 1963, bearing on this Subject.

1. The Office of Security has been advised that you will be a recipient of an honor award in the Headquarters Building in the near future.

3. Secondly, you are asked to scrupulously avoid releasing or cooperating in the release of any publicity regarding the award to public information media such as radio, television or the newspapers. This award should never be mentioned in the presence of any reporter or representative of any public information media.

4. After receiving your award you will be asked to return it together with any accompanying papers to the Secretary, Honor and Morit Awards Board, for safekeeping.

Memo to C/P dated 18 July 1963

1. Irving C. DE VUONO has used tho alias George Lee in the local aron. The circumstances which required the use of this alias 18 as follows:

DEVUONO, accompanied by the Real Estate Officer from the Cover Branch, under the alias Gregory Williams, went to ISLAMORADA in April 1963 to determine the suitability of 8/11 177 for the AMLILAC Group. It was not anticipated at that time that DEVUONO would be required to use his nase with the owner, Eddie Sweeting. However, arranger:onts for the S/H were rade on the spot and the name George Lee given as the occupant of the house.

2. If possible it 13 requested that alias documentation be established in the name of George Lee. This is not an absolute requirement, however, and a registered alias could be assigned.

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

VIA : DCOS/OS

FROM : Chief, Finance, JMWAVE

SUBJECT : Tax Problem of Irving G. DEVUONO

While on TDY at Headquarters, the writer conferred with the Head of the Covert Tax Unit on the subject problem. The writer was informed that the Covert Tax Unit is not able to accept and forward a Covert return for the year 1962 for the subject individual since a Form 1099 had been issued. It was further stated that the Internal Revenue Service, while performing a service last year (tax year 1961) of this nature, would not under any circumstances permit a person and/or persons receiving a Form 1099 or W-2 to file a Covert Return for such reported income. Therefore, it appears all avenues of escape for Irving G. DEVUONO have been closed and he should file an amended return for Tax Year 1962 to include the KUBARK income reported on Form 1099.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Irving C. DEVUONO

SUBJECT : Letter of Instruction

1. This memorandum is to confirm your appointment as Chief, AMLILAC and to provide you with instructions for the direction of that group.

2. The mission is to adapt current assets into a force which can enter the target area by sea or air to conduct reconnaissance, caching, sabotage, raids and/or guerrilla warfare support operations.

3. The organizational concept to be followed is that of small teams which can function independently or in combination and entirely under indigenous leadership. All personnel should be fully qualified in basic paramilitary skills and should be physically and mentally prepared to mount operations on short notice. Airborne capabilities will be developed when facilities necessary for training become available.

4. The standards for members of the group should be constantly upgraded by culling of members who become marginal or who do not develop as expected. Recruitment of promising new members will be dependent on the needs of the station based on policy directives. Priority should be given to sabotage training to permit the mounting of a sabotage program at the earliest possible moment. Coincidentally, planning and thought should be given to the topics of cover, recruitment, training and establishment of those facilities necessary for a rapid expansion of the group if a full scale operational program should be developed. Also, the force should be identified to the primary exile authority as a non political and independent body which is unilaterally engaged in the overthrow of the existing regime. The tempo of training should be maintained at a level sufficient to assure the continual proficiency of the group in all categories of activity in readiness for the order to mount a full scale program with all teams participating simultaneously. Readiness will not itself be justification for operations.

5.  Your staff must be organized to permit close contact with team members so as to assure control over them and at the same time provide full security for the existence of your organization. It must also provide security for the planning of all activities in such a way as to assure the compartmentation of staff and team personnel associated with the different categories of operational activity.

6.  The following guide lines are provided for the organization:

a.  The size and military nature of the force require that the highest possible standard of security be maintained for all personnel and activities. Specifically, the scope should not be comprehended by team members, and compartmentation by teams should be practiced to the maximum.

b.  Should, if possible, be composed of men who have no dependents.

7.  The following tasks should be undertaken immediatoly:

a.  Continue development of cover for all personnel, their absences, injuries, deaths.

b.  Continue the development of concepts to provide for training, during active and inactive periods, transportation to training and staging areas and safehouse utilization.

c.  Continue to devise procedures for handling and storage of classified material, arms and equipment.

d. Establish standards for recruitment, discipline, chain of command and security.

Paragraph 8(d): From the salary paid pursuant to this contract these shall be deducted the appropriate rate percentage (presently 6½%) for deposit and eventual crediting to the Civil Service Retirement Fund. When circumstances of your cover warrant or require contributions to social security such contributions will be at your expense and you will not be reimbursed therefor by the Government.

FROM : IRVING C DEVUONO

SUBJECT: INCOME TAX

I was sent to this Station in Aug 61 and was given a cover breifing at Headquarters before I left in which I was told that since I was paying into a retirement fund of this organization that they would no longer withold Social Security from my pay.

In late 61 I was notified that they wre refunding to me all money withheld for incme tax up to that time and that I would have to file on the inside and to start withholding my own taxes. This was done and I was told by this station to file the covert return with them and to file an overt return on my Army retirement pay. This I did for the year 1961. I was also told by BOB the tax san to file this years return the same way. I made my own tax withholding during 1962 and have the money to cover the taxes, but now I am told that because someone made a mistake and mailed both me and the IRS a form 1099 on my 1963 pay that now I must file an overt return. This now will cause me to pay $225.00 selfemployment tax will make me liable to a 6% penalty for not filing an estimated return quarterly. Since I would not have had to pay these extra taxes if the mistake in mailing the form 1099 had not been made and since I did everything in this matter that the station wanted me to do

I do not feel that this extra cost should be by me. I feel this is penalizing me for someone elses mistake. I ask that this matter be reconsidered and that I be informed as to how I should file my 1962 tax return and that I also be told how this yours withholding is to be done.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Transfer of Irving C. DEVUONO to the ANLILAC Group

1.  On 15 March 1963 a meeting was held at Ace Cartography in order to advise both Irving G. CADICK and Irving C. DE VUONO as to the latters transfer from the AMTABBY group to the AMLILAC group. In attendance at this meeting were Stanley R. ZAMKA, CADICK, DEVUONO and the writer.

2.  ZAMKA initiated the discussion by stating that the 15th would be DEVUONO's last day with CUSOG and that he should take care of any accounts outstanding and complete processing out of CUSOG. DEVUONO was advised he would be contacted by WALTUCK later in the day in reference to his next assignment.

3.  CADICK was then advised he should plan a caching opera- tion during the month of April. The exact location, woight and contents of the cache would be passed to him the afternoon of the 15th. CADICK requested that a boat, the Squall King, with which a great deal of training had been accomplished be permitted to go on this caching operation. ZAMKA agreed that security wise the use of an organic AUTABBY boat might be worthwhile. CADICK will include the use of the Squall King in the operational plan which he will submit this coming week.

4.  This meeting broke up at 1130 hours, 15 March 1963.

Continuation of FITNESS REPORT, Section D:

Subject is a well-qualified para-military specialist, who has fully mastered the tools of his trade. Subject applies all of his para-military knowledge in the performance of his current duties as the senior outside case officer for a thirty-man commando group, which is capable of carrying out a variety of different missions. These missions include caching operations, sabotage raids, tactical intelligence reconnaissance activities and contingency missions related to war plans. Subject is at his best in dealing with men and military equipment. Subject's major weakness is in records management and reports writing. Despite this minor weakness, Subject's over-all performance warrants an evaluation of Proficient.

Subject has the potential to train and operationally exploit para-military forces in units which have a T/O strength of not more than 60 men. Subject could command a conventional military formation at the battalion level. Subject is capable of mounting counter-insurgency operations with the use of forces up to battalion strength.

Subject's work comes to the attention of the Reviewing Officer on a bi-weekly basis.

Subject's future assignments should be in the para-military field. If Subject is to remain in operations in Latin America, he must be given an opportunity to study Spanish on a formal basis.

1.  Headquarters officers in charge of arranging the award ceremony are reluctant to initiate any arrangoments without more information regarding the urgency indicated in Reference. The fact that we reminded them that it had been a year since the award was authorized had little effect.

2.  Are there any plans in the future to sond Irving C. DEVUONO to Hoadquarters? If so, then with several days advance notice of such a trip arrangements for the ceremony could be initiated.

3.  It also would be helpful to indicate whether DEVUONO will bring his family and anticipate a large ceremony or whether he would prefer a smaller, more intimate group gathered in the Director's Office.

TO : COS, JMWAVE

FROM : Chief/CUSOG

SUBJECT: Fitness Report, Devuono

1. The subject report being due, the writer is the only person observing DEVUONO's work and has statements and commendations which should be reflected in his fitness report. The contents of this memorandum will be established in DEVUONO's file in other form at later date by the writer.

2. DEVUONO has completed one year with CUSOG. In this period he has shown a complete and practical knowledge of paramilitary techniques and tactics. This knowledge is born of experience and application. His application of this knowledge for KUBARK has resulted in visible progress in the technical abilities of CUSOG personnel.

3. He has shared CUSOG responsibilities of organization, administration and operational preparation in a manner to follow out KUBARK practices to its credit.

4. He carries out clear instructions to the letter, reflecting a military background.

5. Contrary to observances noted in a previous fitness report DEVUONO has been found to be anything but naive in his dealings with PBRUMENS during the period observed.

6. His administrative and accounting procedures within CUSOG are in order.

7. Hesitating to call them weaknesses, the writer must state that DEVUONO's entire experience with KUBARK has been field experience, usually far out on a long string of contacts into a KUBARK installation, a fact which has prevented a look at any of the administrative side of paramilitary as conducted by KUBARK.

8. This man has good potential for helping KUBARK'S paramilitary effort, which potential will be core effective when he has been schooled in the terminologies and peculiarities of paramilitary KUBARK-style. It is recommended a tour by DEVUONO where such schooling can be conducted as on-the-job training would most bring out this potential.

Subject has had little clandestine training, and is therefore not always able to comprehend the intangible factors which prevent, delay and cancel operations. A further reason is the absence of military law as a basis for discipline for his men. Still another reason is the directive for only limited action with which he has had to live since August. This is merely to say that in a period of policy formation when the action forces have had to be held in limbo, he has not been at his best.

Subject's dealings with his agents have in turn been affected by his own frustrations. His inability to rationalize situations has resulted in obtuse explanations to them which have made them harder to handle. His reluctance to put things on paper has detracted from his performance and denied him the clarifying process which reporting provides. His security consciousness has been similarly affected by his frustrations. Subject is in need of training in tradecraft and PM operations. His basic qualifications for PM Case Officer work are such that he can, with training, do a such better job. This combined with a program of concentrated action would undoubtedly bring out the best in him, which should be of real value to the Agency.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/4

SUBJECT: Project CABAL Reports.
William Robertson - Grayston Lynch

REFERENCE: Memo from Chief, CA/PMG to Chief, WH/4,
1 June 1982, Subject: Assignment of
Robertson and Lynch to WH Division.

16 JUL 1982

1. Paragraph 9 of Reference requested that CA/C/PAG be kept informed of the standard of performance, and of the acquisition of additional capabilities by either training or experience, of Robertson and Lynch during the period of their assignment to WH Division.

2. Robertson and Lynch now have been employed operationally by WH/4 for a period of six months, and as they are the first to have been engaged under the new RJDAL program, it would be appreciated if we could have reports from Chief, WH/4 on these men at an early date. In addition to the data required on regular Fitness Reports, we are interested particularly in knowing from WH/4:

3. How these men are being used, i.e., whether they are engaged in operations, training, planning, etc.; and the extent to which this has been exclusively in the field of RM activities.

a. If engaged in agent operations, whether they are employed as singleton agents, principal agents, recruiters, etc.

b. The degree and general location of their possible exposure to hazardous duty, if any.

c. The degree to which they may have been compromised in terms of personal security, if at all, and the general location where this may have happened.

d. Any new skills they may have acquired either by training or experience.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 296

j. Also, since CA/PMG has ultimate responsibility for these ZRJEWEL personnel after their operational usefulness to WH Division has ended, it would be very helpful to us in planing the future conduct of the ZRJEWEL program if occasionally we could have a report directly from each of these men personally, giving us their own appraisal of their current utilization. In this regard we would appreciate your view as to whether this would be feasible, within the bounds of operational security, and whether it could best be accomplished by requesting written reports, or by oral de-briefings when these men are in the Washington area.

TO : Irving C. DEVUONO DATE:

Thru : Recorder, Honor and Merit Awards Board

FROM : Security Advisor, Honor and Merit Awards Board

SUBJECT: Award Recommendation

Ref : Recommendation for Honor or Merit Award, dated ló October 1961

1. In the reference DEVUONO is recommended for an honor or merit award. It is noted the reference states he is currently in the field.

2. If the award is granted, the following security measures are recommended:

a. The award should be retained within Headquarters until such time as DEVUONO returns to Headquarters on a permanent change of station and security/cover considerations permit the release of the award to him. There would, of course, be an objections to informing hirm of the granting of the award by me of Agency secure channels.

b. Prior to DETUONO's receiving physical possession of the award he should be instructed there are no objections to his showing the award to his immediate family and his associates in the Agency but that he should not release or cooperate in releasing any publicity regarding the granting of the award.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Policy Concerning Guests at Award Ceremonies

1.  The Office of the Director has determined that when inviting guests to award ceremonies, the Agency will be as liberal as possible within the bounds of available space and security considerations since one of the purposes of an award ceremony is to let the family, friends, and associates of the recipient know that he has been honored.

2.  In implementing this policy the points listed below will be guiding criteria:

a. Any Agency employee who is a friend of a recipient may come to ceremony, up to the limit of space available, if the recipien asks that he be present.

b. Any Government employee (who is not employed by the Agency but who is witting of the recipient's employment) can come so long as there are no operational security reasons that would make his presence inappropriate.

c. Any friend who is not employed by the Government may be invited an'y if it is obviously desirable (Example-- A-very close old friend who stood in the relationship of "family" to the recipient when subject had no immediate family). Friends who are not employed by the Government normally would be discouraged.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Awards, Cases of Mr. William Robertson and Mr. Grayson Lynch

1.  The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend cash awards for subject employees.

2.  In recent paramilitary operations against Cuba, Mr. Lynch and Mr. Robertson served as operations officers of the Central Intelligence Agency vessels ADDUCI and BARBARA J respectively. Both of these employees, in the course of extremely hazardous operations, repeatedly exposed themselves to fire by opposing land, sea and air forces. Their fearless and skilled leadership enabled indigenous forces to conduct an amphibious landing under the most difficult conditions, and their courageous determination to keep their vessels in position to support the operations, although under heavy air attack, was in keeping with the best traditions of the American people at war. Furthermore, their repeated landings, in person, on a hostile shore for the purpose of rescuing Cuban survivors of the invasion force, was a demonstration of extraordinary valor. Their exemplary conduct throughout the combat action was above and beyond the call of duty.

3.  Military personnel performing in combat in such a manner would be eligible for the highest decorations for heroism.

4.  In view of the extraordinary heroism displayed by Mr. Robertson and Mr. Lynch, I strongly recommend that they be awarded an appropriate commendation, and, in addition, a cash bonus award of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) each.

1.  This is in response to your oral request for the transfer or assignment of Robertson and Lynch from this Staff to WH Division.

2.  These employees were recruited as Career Agents under CA/PMG Project ZRJEWEL, and therefore are to be administered in accordance with the terms of this Project.

3.  Under the terms of Project ZRJEWEL, CA/C/PMG is responsible initially for their selection and recruitment, and subsequently for their training and developmental assignments until they are transferred to an existing operational project under jurisdiction of an operating division.

4.  Selection and recruitment involves complete processing to contract status under provisions of HB 20-1000-1, and requires also:

a. Security Clearances

b. Medical Clearances

d. Financial Briefing

e. Assessment and Evaluation

5.  Training and development requires that subjects be provided tutorial or group training, according to their individual needs to qualify them as senior PM officers capable of serving overseas as

a. Language aptitude testing and subsequent
languago training.

b. Clandestine tradecraft.

c. Paramilitary operations training.

d. Covers Action Operations training and Cl
Familiarisation,

6. Although both subjects are now under contract, as of this
   time, of all of the above-mentioned items of processing, training and
   development, the following yet romains to bo done:

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contract Negotiations with Mr. Grayston L. Lynch

1.  After discussing the proposed contract for Mr. Lynch with Messrs. Earman, Collins, Barnes, King, Esterline, and others and obtaining their agreement that the proposed contract was a fair one, I met with Mr. Lynch on the morning of 24 May 1961. 1 outlined, in detail, to him at that time the many advantages accruing to hirn through the new contract over the previous contract. Mr. Lynch stated that he had not been fully aware of these benefits, that he was afraid he had given the wrong impressions to us with regard to his salary demands, and that he would be glad to sign the contract as offered.

2.  Mr. Lynch signed the contract later in the morning.

3.  I also had advised Mr. Lynch that Colonel King and Mr. Esterline had been requested to look into the possibility and desirability of obtaining for him a bonus award because of his services on the Pro- ject. I told him that they had agreed to look into this, that no promises could be made, and that any such award was a matter entirely outside the scope of his contractual arrangements and employment by this Staff.

4.  I then called Mr. Earmar and advised him of the above. Mr. Earman indicated that he was sure the Director would be very pleased to hear that a suitable agreement had been reached, but that the Director also would undoubtedly raise the question of the bonus award at some future date. I, therefore, undertook on behalf of Mr. Earman to re-raise the question of the award with Mr. Esterline early in the week of May 29, 1961.

# GRAYSTON L. LYNCH - COMPARISON OF CONTRACTS

1. TYPE OF CONTRACT

a. Under his present contract LYNCH is serving as a Contract Employee.

b. The new contract would make him a Career Agent. Uuder R 20-1000, a Career Avent is an individual who has demonstrated his operational value to the Agency over a period normally of not less than three years for U.3. citizens. LYNCH has served with the Agency only for a period of about three months.

2. COMPENSATION

a. Rate of pay under present contract is $9,500 per annum, plus a post differential in accordance with regulations.

b. New rate of pay would be $11,000, plus post differential, plus ingrade promotions and legislative ay adjustments effecting Government personnel.

3. ALLOWANCES

a. Present contract does not provide for any special allowances.

b. The new contract provides for (1) living quarters allowances, and (2), cost of living allowance including but not limited to, a post allowance or equivalent, supplementary post allowance, transfer allowance, home service transfer allowance, education allowance, and separution allowance.

4. TRAVEL

a. Present contract pays cost of operational travel, plus per diem in lieu of subsistence.

b. New contract pays cost of operational travel and per diem, plus: (1) cost of PCS travel and transportation for dependents, household effects and automobile; (2), storage of household and personal effects not shipped; and (3), after two years overseas, all travel for self and dependents from duty station to home residence and return to duty station.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 319

## 5. OPERATIONAL EXPENSES

a. Present contract authorizes operational expenses as specifically approved.

b. New contract expands this to include operational entertainment and purchase of information.

## 6. BENEFITS

a. Present contract provides death and disability benefits under Federal Employees Compensation Act, and benefits under the Missing Persons act; and states that Social Security deductions will be withheld by the Government.

b. New contract provides for these same benefits; but would make deductions for the Civil Service Retirement Fund instead of the Social Security. In addition the new contract provides for, (1) Sick and Annual leave equal to that of Staff employees; (2), cost of hospitalization and travel for illness or injury incurred in line of duty, while PCS abroad; (3) cost of hospitalization and travel of dependents while abroad; and (4), authorization to apply for enrollment in the Agency health insurance program.

## 7. TERM

a. The term of the present contract is for one year, subject to termination upon 30 days notice.

b. The new contract is for an indefinite term, subject to termination upon 90 days notice.

## 8. SPECIAL BONUS

a. There is an Amendment to the present contract, dated 2 May 1961, and made retroactive to cover the period 28 March thru 22 April 1961, only, which authorizes a bonus of 40% of normal monthly compensation while LYNCH was serving aboard ship involved in clandestine maritime activity.

b. There can be no provision in any new contract for declaring a bonus for unforeseen future activities.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 320

## 9. COMMENT

a. During our first discussions with LYNCH 10 May 1961, on the question of salary, he stated that he would not accept a new contract at the rate of pay ($9,500) of his present contract, because the Director had promised that he would receive more; however, he would not give us a figure that he would accept. Before the new contract was written he was told that it would be for $11,000, and he voiced no objection. After the contract was written and presented to him for signature, he stated that he wanted $12,500, plus "hazardous duty pay", and that he wanted to take the contract to the Director for review.

b. At the time of his retirement, LYNCH was an Army Captain with 20 years service, and I understand that he was in jump status. Remuneration for this service was about $9,425 per annum, including all allowances. His present retirement pay is $281 per month, or $3,372 per year, and I understand that he would be authorized to retain this in addition to all pay and allowances received from an Agency contract.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Wil/14/Personnel

SUBJECT: Recall of Captain Rydberg and Fr. Lynch for further Testimony

1. Kr. Eduardo Garcia, owner of the ships used in the JMATE operation, has requested a $250. bonus for each of the men employed by him. This is consistent with the bonus arrangement for all Cubans participating in the operation.

2. Chief, WH. Division, has approved the payment of such a bonus to all Garcia personnel, except the survivors of the Rio Escondido. He is withholding approval for these personnel, pending a further investigation into alleged mutinous acts by the survivors, while aboard the Elagar. He has requested that additional information on this subject be obtained from both Captain Rydberg and Mr. Lynch.

3. It is requested that you contact Captain Rydberg and Mr. Lynch, and have them return to Washington at their earliest convenience for the purpose of giving further testimony in this regard.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: G.L. Lynch - ZRJEWEL

1. Lynch called today at 1200 noon. He said that he wanted to let me know that he was back, and to find out what had been done about his contract.

2. I told him that I had heard nothing since he had left. I said that before he left we had rather leaned over backwards to write a contract for him which he had not accepted; that instead he had taken the matter to the Director, and that I had then been requested to deliver a copy of the contract to the Director's office which I had done. I said that I had then acted as messenger boy only, and had not discussed the matter at the Director's office, nor heard anything about it since.

3. Lynch said that he could fill me in from there. He said that at the Director's office the contract had been turned over to the Director's Executive Officer who was to review it and recommend a salary figure. Lynch said that he had agreed to accept whatever figure the Executive Officer recommended, and was told to call CA/C/PMG/Mr. Cox on his return.

4. I asked Lynch where he could now be reached, and he said that he was at Bob Moore's office on X-8912.

NOTE:

Since his precipitate meeting with the Director about 1730 hours on 16 May 1961, Lynch has not been heard from. Presumably he returned' to his home in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

On 18 May 1961, CA/PT had calls from the office of both WH/4 and C/WH asking if we knes of Lynch's whereabout, and whether we had a record of his Fayetteville address. The answer to both questions was negative. Subsequently his address was located in files and WII was informed.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/4
SUBJECT: Assignment of Robertson and Lynch to Wi! Division

1. This is in response to your oral request for the transfer or assignment of Robertson and Lynch from this Staff to Will Division.

2. These employees were recruited as Career Agente under CA/PNG Project PRJEWEL, and therefore are to be wiministered in accordance with the terms of this Project.

3. Under the terms of Project ZRJEWEL, CA/C/PMG 10 responsible initially for their selection and recruitment, and subsequently for their training and developmental assigamente until they are transferred to an existing operational project under juristiction of an operating division.

4. Selection and recruitment involves complete processing to contract under provisions of HB 20-1000-1, and requires also:

a. security clearances

b. Medical Clearances

c. provision of cover

d. Financial Briefing

e. Авзеватеnt and Evaluation

5. Training and development requires that subject to be provided tutorial or group training, according to their individual needs, to qualify them as senior PM Officers capable of serving overseas as case officer, insthuators, advisers, or consultante; and capable of developing addigenous forces, directing operations, and personally participating in operations. The training envisioned normally would include, but not be limited to:

熱。 Language aptitude testing and subsequent language training
b. Clandestine tradecraft
c. Paramilitary operations training
d. Covert Action Operations training and CIF: Fmiliarization

6. Although both subjects are now under contract, as of this time, of all of the above mentioned items of processing, training and development, the following yet remains to be dore:

Robertson: Medical clearance, provision of cover, financial briefing, Spanish language aptitude test and spanish language training, Clandestine refresher training as deemed adviseable.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 342

# SECRET

COPY

Lynch - provision of cover, financial briefing, assessment and evaluation, language aptitude test and possible language training, and all basic Clandestine Operations training.

7. Project 25USWELL further provides that administrative responsibility for these employees including compensation, operational security etc. will be transferred to the Operating Division for such periods of time as the employees are under the jurisdiction of the Division for operational duties. For administrative purposes, it is suggested that WH Division assume these responsibilities for both Robertson and Lynch as of 1 June 1961.

8. On of the major considerations in the contract employment of these two officers has been that their lack of association with the Agency, thus far, permits their operational utilization in circumstances where staff employees cannot participate, and their long range continued employment is, to a certain extent, dependent on their being abot to maintain this posture. It is requested, therefore, that you take every reasonable precaution to maintain their "deniable" status.

9. Since the CA Staff will once again become responsible for these officers whenever such time may come that you no longer have a reqiore,emt for the, ot wpi; be veru, ich aftrecoated of tjos office would be kept advised as to their standard of performance, Acquisition of additional capabilities, by either training or experience, and we should be consulted before any changes or amendments are made in their contracts which might become commitments to be assumed by the CA Staff

His first area of interest is Europe/Germany but he would serve where ever assigned.

Looks like a good PM prospect for a training officer down below. Jungle warfare, escape and evasion are his specialities.

Will contact us when he returns from special six month assignment in Laos.

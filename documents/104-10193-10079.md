Miss Goodpasture has been on sick leave since July 1972 awaiting medical retirement in October 1973. She is a charter member of the Agency, having entered on duty from OSS and its successor organizations. Her career is highly distinguished by virtue of consistently strong to outstanding performance, all of which is fully documented.

In addition to several staff and desk assignments, Miss Goodpasture served in support of the successful coup against the communist government in Guatemala in 1954 and completed tours of duty in Bombay, Monterrey and Mexico City. Undoubtedly, the high point of her career occurred during her service in Mexico City from 1957 through 1970, where she served as a "trouble-shooting" case officer for the incomparable Winfield Scott (deceased), who was then the Chief of Station. Mr. Scott, a stern task-master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as "intelligent, hard-working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the most competent CI/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with." Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings. In her final assignment prior to acute medical problems, she worked for the CI Staff (October 1970-October 1971), earning the following remarks from her supervisor: "...I venture to rate her overall performance, thirty years of it, as Outstanding. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which this organization is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this organization will be weakened." The reviewing official agreed with the above and recorded his hope that Miss Goodpasture get the official Agency recognition she so richly deserves for the many years she has made substantive

MEMORANDUM FOR: Miss Ann L. Goodpasture

THROUGH: Administrative Officer, CI Staff

SUBJECT: Application to Purchase Service Credit

1.  This is to advise you that your application to purchase service credit under the CIA Retirement and Disability System has been processed. The period of your service which is not covered by retirement deductions and the amount due to cover this period are as follows:

| Redeposit Period         | Total Amount Due |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| 11 Mar 1942 - 8 Sep 1943 | $241.00          |

2.  Postponing payment will cause the amount due to increast because of additional interest at the rate of 3 per cent compounded annually. However, so long as the amount is not paid, you have the use of this money for other purposes. You may postpone payment until you retire.

3.  If the redeposit is not made you will receive no credit in the computation of annuity for the period of service covered by the refund. This usually results in a sharp reduction in the amount of your annuity.

4.  If you wish to make payment for the redeposit period, please make your check payable to the Treasurer of the United States and forward it to the Chief, Retirement Operations Branch, 205 Magazine Building. If you prefer, you may make installment payments or arrange for bi-weekly payroll aliotments of $25.00 or multiples thereof. A receipt showing a statement of your account will be sent to you acknowledging each installment payment.

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-13
Miss Ann L. Goodpasture

1. Miss Ann L. Goodpasture has been in Mexico City for five years and during this period has functioned as a Case Officer support- ing operations against Soviet and Satellite targets. She was recommended for promotion in February 1961 and September 1961.

2. Miss Goodpasture is a seasoned and able employee who excels in the field of CE analysis. Her diligence, imagination, and experience have made her indispensable to the Station, which processes a great mass of information on Soviet and Satellite CE targets. Her knowledge of this field is encyclopedic, and the pro- fundity of her analyses is equal to any occasion. She is a steady, cheerful worker who has the respect and affection of all her colleagues. She does her job without assistance and she is always willing to help with special Station projects.

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion to Grade GS-13 -
Miss Ann L. Goodpasture

1. Miss Ann L. Goodpasture has been assigned to the Mexico City Station since early 1957 as a Case Officer in support of CI/CE operations directed against Soviet targets in Mexico. The Chief of Station recommended Miss Goodpasture for promotion in February of 1961.

2. Miss Goodpasture is a highly competent employee who has shown great strength in performing operational tasks which require a high degree of analytical ability, patience, and initiative.

Miss Goodpasture is highly motivated, performs all her assignments with great dispatch in a most professional manner, and does have the qualifications found in more senior Case Officers.

FROM: Chief of Substation,
Monterrey, Mexico

SUBJECT: Administrative
Personnel-4

Dispatch No: HMYA-7
30 October 1952

1. David Konan has asked that I state my preference with regard to home leave and reassignment. I will be eligible for home leave in July 153 but it is not urgent that my leave be scheduled exactly when due. I would like, however, to know what opportunities exist with headquarters and whether I should be looking elsewhere for employment aftor July 1953.

2. With regard to another two year tour of duty in Nonterrey, I would prefer a more responsible job than is forseeable here. Now that the station files are set-up and the administrative routine is established, my job, while termed Administrative Assistant, is mainly that of a clerk-typist. The practice in typing naa been good for me but I would like to look forward to a more re- sponsible job for the next tour of duty. For instance, as a CS-9 I am performing the same type job which I did in 1945 at a CAF-4 and a considerably less responsible job than the one performed at headquarters as a ?-2. While I have been taking Spanish lessons, I know that I as not proficient enough in the language for an assignment in Latin America, and feel that I would be better off in another area.

3. For the benefit of the case officer in assigning a replacement, Konan has suggested that I outline the duties which my replacement should be trained to perform. The routine can be learned in the field within two or three weeks.

a) Copy typing. About 75% of the time will be taken up with routine typing.

b) Index carding. About 600 Index cards a week are now being typed for the card files and for the visa section files.

c) Preparation of wurier mail. Couriers usually go to the border approximately every two weeks but there is no regular schedule, and pouches are sometimes prepared on a few hours notice.

d) Communications. The incumbent should have complete training for cur codes for he will not have much practice in the field as only two or three messages are transmit tod monthly.

e) Photography. At the present time, considerable operational use is being made of a darcrocs at my residence. In addition to my own photographic equipment, the station photographic equipment is used there. My replacement should be trained in the use of the duo-printer and in 35mm copy work. If he has no personal photographic equipment, headquarters may wish to issue him a camera as there is only one camera at the station. Most of the copy work has been done with my personal rolleiflex and enlarger.

f) Administrative Reports.

(1) Station Funds. He will be responsible for dispensing funds, keeping records and preparation of the monthly accounting reports.

(2) Property. He will be responsible for keeping records of government property and preparation of periodic reports and inventories.

(3) Exchange commodities. He will de responsible for keeping records and preparing periodic reports and inventories.

g) Maintenance of Files. The station files are set-up along the lines recommended by headquarters, and should require little time for upkeep.

h) Information Reports. Dependent upon the clerical workload, he may assist Konan in the preparation of information reports.

i) Cover Job. Hone. If there are only two people at the station, the replacement for my job would not have time to perform a cover Job and consequently, would have no regular working relationship with the DYMARON employees.

4. A resourceful person can find Monterrey a very er.joyable post. From a social point of view, the city is not a dull place and either a single girl or man can find plenty of things to do. There are a limited number of single persona here, but one can always find somewhere to go and something to do. The American colony, as a whole, is the friendliest group that I have known at any post and they are very gracious with invitations to their homes. If headquarters has someone in mind for this post and would like elaboration on living conditions in Monterrey, I shall be glad to forward them on request.

Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO: CPD

FROM: Chief, FBZ

DATE: 12 December 1947

SUBJECT: Ann L. Goodpasture

Temporary Promotion

1. Subject is administrative assistant at our installation in Bombay, India. Due to the increased cost of living in Bombay, request is made that she be given a temporary promotion from a CAF-7 to a CAF-9. The increase in salary, plus the additional cost-of-living and quarters allowances, will be sufficient to permit Miss Goodpasture to meet the highly inflated cost of living in Bombay, an impossibility for the past several months.

2. A review of subject's reports on living conditions in Bombay reveals that since her arrival in April, she has had to live in temporary quarters on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. The rooms occupied by subject have been shared with at least one other girl and sometimes two or three. Bathroom facilities are also shared with the other occupants of the hotel. During a period of several months, subject and her roommate occupied a nine by twelve room on the fifth floor of a "walk-up" and shared a bath with four men. This room cost them $150 a month each. At the present time subject and her roommate are living in a single room, without private bath, and for the privilege are paying Rs. 200 a week each (approximately $60.).

3. In a dispatch dated 28 November, subject stated that "I am now spending more than my combined salary and allowances to maintain only a moderate standard of living. It appears at present that it is unlikely that any permanent quarters will be found for unmarried members of the staff. Since four officers' families are en route to Bombay and three such families presently in Bombay are without places to live. Any accommodations secured through the Consulate will of course be made available first to the highest ranking officer in need of housing. Any accommodations found through other channels have so far been prohibitive in price...".

4. In support of subject's statement of conditions she attached, at the Consul General's suggestion, a copy of his report to the State Department dated November 7, 1947. Pertinent portions of the Consul General's dispatch have been

-1-

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 78

excerpted and are appended to this memorandum.

5. Subject's present salary, minus retirement and income tax, is $105.12 per two-week pay period; her present living and quarters allowance amounts to $78.45. The proposed increase to a CAF-9 would bring her net salary to $127.43 per two-week pay period and her living allowance to $103.07 - a difference of $46.92 every two weeks. A promotion to a CAF-8 would be insufficient, since her allowances would remain the same and the salary increase would amount only to $10.75 per pay period.

# AMERICAN CONSULATS GENERAL

Despatch No. 537.
File No: 125.42
JOHN J. MACDONALD, ad

Bombay, India, November 7, 1947

THE HONORABLE

THE SECRETARY OF STATE

WASHINGTON

SIR:

I have the honor to refer to my despatches numbered 93, 281 and 480 dated April 5, June 19 and September 13, 1947 respectively, and to report that the housing situation in Bombay is getting more critical daily.


Not only is living at hotels, unsatisfactory in this climate, but it is far more expensive than any member of this staff can afford. So far the staff has accepted the unsatisfactory and expensive living conditions without undue complaints but this situation cannot continue without seriously affecting morale and forcing resignations, or requests for transfers which I cannot conscientiously disapprove. The local authorities have been requested on numerous occasions to assist this office in obtaining living quarters and, although they have been making vague promises ever since my arrival last February, no houses or apartments have materialized. It is not likely that anything will be obtained through the Government unless a substantial bribe known locally as "pugree" is paid. It is generally recognized now that only persons and firms paying "pugree" get living accommodations.

An endeavor is being made to find a suitable residence for the Consul General and staff quarters that can be purchased, but the demand for all types of dwellings has resulted in fantastically high prices and it is doubtful that anything will be obtained.

This office had an opportunity of leasing a floor of a building that could have been made into three apartments as reported in my telegram No. 366 dated October 13, 1947. This request was disapproved by the Department and it is most unlikely that another opportunity of this sort will arise. It must be pointed out that if any places do become available, the landlord will demand a lease on behalf of the Department before he will even consider renting the place. Landlords with whom I have talked informed me that if any of their places do become available they will not lease them to members of the staff but will lease them to the Department.

I cannot stress sufficiently the seriousness of the present situation particularly, from the financial standpoint and request that the Department increase the rent allowance for members of the staff who are

-1-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 80

forced to live in temporary quarters. If this is not done it will be impossible for them to live within their income if they romain at this post.

Respectfully yours,

John J. MacDonald,

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

Division 1, FBZ, requests that the above subject be trans- ferred from SSJ Registry to Div. I, FBZ. Three copies of her Form 57 are attached.

It is planned to send Miss Goodpasture to Bombay upon com- pletion of her CIG and State Department training. Her present grade is a CAF-5, but her duties in her new position entitie her to a promotion to a CAF-7 upon her arrival in Bombay. A job description is attached.

When Miss Goodpasture first made known her desire to return to the Far East, this division contacted Registry and found that they were willing to release her for an overseas assignment. A replace- ment has already been obtained for her and Miss Goodpasture will be on leave from 4 November to 2 December, 1946. Registry agreed to carry her on their rolls until their personnel is torminated by SSU or until she can be picked up by CIG-which ever is sooner.

Miss Ann L. Goodpasture

Miss Ann L. Goodpasture reported back to SI Washington from Shanghai on 1 April 1946. On the trip back, she developed a rather serious ear ailment, and it is feared that an operation may be necessary. Dr. Thompson of the Medical Division was going to attempt to have her admitted to a hospital Monday night for further attention and treatment. After release from the hospital she will go to her home in Tipton, Oklahoma.

In view of the above facts, we shall show Miss Goodpasture as being on sick leave (approximately one month) until her return to duty, at which time she will fill out the form 71 and any other necessary papers.

Miss Ann L. Goodpasture

Miss Ann L. Goodpasture who returned from Shanghai on 1 April 1946 has informed me that she has cancelled her "Power of Attorney" in writing and that she has not been paid since 9 February.

It is requested that hor case be checked and necessary steps be taken to reimburse hor. Misa Goodpasture has been a Clerk-Stono, CAF-5, $2320 with the SI office since 16 Dec. 1945. She departed from Shanghai on 5 March and arrived in Fashington on 30 March.

Misa Goodpasture is being hospitalized immediately, due to a serious ear ailment which developed on the trip back, and will probably be out for approximately one month. Any payments should be mailed to her in Tipton, Oklahoma (no Street address), until further notice.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Ann L. GOODPASTURE
18 October 1970- 31 October 1971

To the immense regret of this writer Ann Goodpasture is retiring very soon. It would be silly to rate her competitively against any of her colleagues, male or female, young or merely well-preserved. Concerning her fitness be it recorded that she is very fit indeed to perform any of the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any others I can think of at almost any grade. I venture to rate her over-all performance, thirty years of it, as OUTSTANDING. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which this organization is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this organization will be weakened.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently turns in a strong performance when she is not doing an outstanding job. She is an excellent office and project manager who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor and briefer. Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization. I hope she gets the official Agency recognition she deserves for the many years she has made substantive contribution to the CS.

SUBJECT. GENERAL- WI Intstrative

SPECIFIC Anne GOODPASTURE

ACTION REQUIRED: See Para 5.

1. The following is submitted for ration of C/WH/ADMIN and the additional aire rination ere consideres reces47.

2. On 25 May 1957 the personal a tomobile uned by subject was hit by a tornado, removing the hood and other parts of the body. The auto was in custody of subject's brother (in the ites States) who contacted the Lawton, Oklahoma, claims adjuster for bert's car insurance (the GEICO Goverment Employees Insurance Company, ashda, ton, D.C.) who authorized complete coverage. Subject was unaware of the accident until repairs had been completed. There were no personal injuries and no newspaper accounts as this loss was insignificant compared to catastrophic flood and tornado damages in the area.

3. On the insurance policy taken out in 1955, Subject's employment was shown as U.S. Government with the MI AA adress. The claim to be valid had to show the same. The policy could not be amended to reflect subject's ostensible employment as this type of insurance is available only to U.S. Government employees.

4. Subject brought his automobile into ico on 1 June 1957 and is advising the GEICO that he expects to be in ice indefinitely and desires that his U.S. insurance be cancelled wit receipt of the letter (probably about 10 June 1957.)

5. If queried by CEIOT, it is requested that we acknowledge subject's MARK employment to cover the period of the a cident.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Ann L. GOODPASTURE
18 October 1970 - 31 October 1971

To the immense regret of this writer Ann Goodpasture is retiring very soon. It would be silly to rate her competitively against any of her colleagues, male or female, young or merely well-preserved. Concerning her fitness be it recorded that she is very fit indeed to perform any of the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any others I can think of at almost any grade. I venture to rate her over-all performance, thirty years of it, as OUTSTANDING. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which this organization is woven, and when she retires the fabric of this organization will be weakened.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently turns in a strong performance when she is not doing an outstanding job. She is an excellent office and project manager who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor and briefer. Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization. I hope she gets the official Agency recognition she deserves for the many years she has made substantive contribution to the CS.

I. Course Objectives: to familiarize the students with the various types of CE operations and with methods and procedures peculiar to CE in the field and at Headquarters, to outline CE objectives, and to increase proficiency in the recognition and exploitation of leads.

II. Course Characteristics: The Counterespionage Operations Course is of three weeks' duration. The curriculum material is presented by means of lectures, seminars, and directed reading. It is divided into sections as follows:

A. Introduction (definition of terms, the CI Staff, operational Security and risk assessment, sources of CI leads, CI reporting and records)

B. Interrogation

C. Foreign Intelligence Services (with emphasis on currently hostile services including a lecture on CI in Liaison)

D. Penetration and Defection

E. Double Agent Operations

During the course each student is required to present orally a CE case and to submit a written version of the case. Evaluations are based on problems, the case analysis presented by the student, and objective tests.

S-E-C-R-E-T


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 202

### III. Evaluation

A. Two double agent problems requiring case analysis. This analysis involves thorough study of the case:

1.  To determine areas of missing, inadequate, or questionable information
2.  To pick out infomation which can be checked through other sources
3.  To recognize all possible ?eads
4.  To assess the risk involved
5.  То рrороза appropriate action (operational decisions)

S-E-C-R-E-T


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 203

IV. COMMENTS: Miss Goodpasture's handling of the problems indicated that
she is capable of shrewd analysis. She overlooked some points which
might have been considered in one problem and dealt with the other
problem in too brief fashion, but in general her analysis reflected
her actual experience and suggested that she is perhaps stronger in
analysis than in making operational decisions. She presented a rather
complex case and demonstrated that she not only understood the case
but was able to give a clear account of it.

1. EXPLANATION OF ADJECTIVAL RATINGS:

SUPERIOR The student demonstrated outstanding ability or proficiency
in meeting this course goal or objective; he indicated a thorough knowledge of the material presented, or, if skills are involved,
he demonstrated that he is one of the most effective individuals in

manner; he demonstrated a good understanding and grasp of the information
presented, or, if skills are involved, he demonstrated sufficient competence

IV. COMMENT: Miss Goodpasture's handling of the problems indicated that she is capable of shrewd analysis. She overlooked some points which might have been considered in one problem and dealt with the other problem in too brief fashion, but in general her analysis reflected her actual experience and suggested that she is perhaps stronger in analysis than in making operational decisions. She presented a rather complex case and demonstrated that she not only understood the case but was able to give a clear account of it.

V. EXPLANATION OF ADJECTIVAL RATTINGS:

**SUPERIOR** The student demonstrated outstanding ability or proficiency in meeting this course goal or objective; he indicated an unusually thorough knowledge of the material presented, or, if skills are involved, he demonstrated that he is one of the most effective individuals, in this area.

**EXCELLENT** The student showed unusual competence, skill, or ability in meeting this objective or goal; he demonstrated a thorough grasp of the presented material, or if skills are involved, he demonstrated that he can perform in an extremely effective manner in this area.

**SATISFACTORY** The student met this objective in a competent and adequate manner; he demonstrated a good understanding and grasp of the information presented, or, if skills are involved, he demonstrated sufficient competence to operate effectively in this area.

**POOR** Although the student may have met some of the standards set for minimum achievement of this course goal or objective, he demonstrated serious gaps in knowledge or sufficient lack of skill to be of doubtful competence.

**FAILURE:** The student was unable to grasp the concepts or information presented, or demonstrated that he had not acquired the necessary information and skills to operate at even minimum capacity in this area.

SECTION IV

OFFICE OF PERSONNEL

This section is provided as an aid in describing the individual. Your description is not favorable in itself but acquires its meaning in relation to a particular job or assignment. The description is not to be interpreted literally.

On the left-hand side of the page below are a series of statements that apply in degree to most people. On the right hand side of the page are four major categories of descriptions. The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks; this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at the statement on the left then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating. Placing an "X" in the "Not Served" column means you have no opinion on whether a phrase applies to an individual. Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have the definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER

The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall determine to his own satisfaction that this appointment would be in conformance with the Civil Service Act, applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations and acts of Congress pertaining to appointments.

This form should be checked for holding of office, pension, suitability in connection with any record of recent discharge or arrest, and particularly for the following:

(1) Identity of appointee.- The appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application and or other pertinent papers. The physical appearance may be checked against the medical certificate. The appointee may also be questioned on his personal history for agreement with his previous statements.

(2) Age. - If definite age limits have been established for the position, it should be determined that applicant is not outside the age range for appointment. Until such determination is made, the appointment may not be consummated.

(3) Citizenship.-The appointing officer is responsible for observing the citizenship provisions of (1) the Civil Service Rules and (2) appropriation acts. Form 61 constitutes an affidavit for both purposes and is acceptable proof of citizenship status in the absence of written evidence. In doubtful cases the appointment should not be consummated until clearance has been secured from the certifying office of the Civil Service Commission.

(4) Members of Family.-Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that whenever there are already two or more members of a family serving under probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service, no other member of such family is eligible for probational or permanent appointment in the competitive service. The appointments of persons entitled to veteran preference are not subject to this requirement. The members-of-family provision does not apply to temporary appointments. Doubtful cases may be referred to the appropriate office of the Civil Service Commission for decision.

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER

The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall determine to his own satisfaction that this appointment would be in conformance with the Civil Service Act applicable civil service rules, the War Service Regulations, and acts of Congress pertaining to appointment.

This form should be checked for holding of office, pension, purchase of office, suitability in connection with any record of misconduct discharge or arrest, promise to observe provisions regarding political activity, and particularly for the following:

(1) Identity of appointee with the applicant whose appointment was authorized. The appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application and or other pertinent papers. The physical appearance may be checked against the medical certificate. The appointee may also be questioned on his personal history for agreement with his previous statements.

(2) Age. If discrepancy exists between the date of birth and that on application, and if definite age limits have been established for the position it should be determined that applicant is not outside the age range for appointment.

(3) Citizenship. The responsibility for citizenship provisions of appropriation acts prohibiting or restricting the employment remains lies with the appointing
officer. The Civil Service Commission indicates on applications showing foreign citizenship has been verified. The appointing officer should verify citizenship if the birth certificate or the letter of authority from the Commission accompanies the appointment or sufficient proof of citizenship if the application shows birth but does not indicate on its face that citizenship has been proved. If the answer to question 6 of this form shows foreign birth and the application claims birth in the United States, the case should be referred to the Civil Service Commission.

(4) Members of Family. — Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that when- ever there are already two or more members of the family in the classified service, no other member of such family is eligible for appointment in that service. Minors who maintain a different family, merely by living at an address different from that of the parents. Doubtful cases involving more than two members of family, and all partnership cases should be referred to the Civil Service Com- mission for its duly authorized recommendations for decision. Under War Service Regulations, the member- ship provision does not apply to temporary appointments.

## Present Positions

At the present time I am working in two places: one position is with the War Relocation Authority in the Placement and Training Unit of the Personnel Management Section which consists principally of clerical duties; the other position is with Congressional Intelligence, a private news service, the work consists of preparing for publication various legislative reports, press releases and current congressional information. The combined salaries amount to $204. per month.

The Civil Service position which I now have is a grade CAF-3 $1620. Although I am now doing personnel work, I do not feel that I am utilising to the fullest extent my experience and educational qualifications and would be interested in transferring to any position for which I am qualified. I would prefer a position with a salary which would not necessitate my being on two jobs at one time.

I have no objection to a secretarial position if it is of a responsible nature, however I feel that I am better qualified for a Junior Administrative, Personnel or clerical accounting position.

## EDUCATION

Baltimore Public School system until 12th grade
High School equivalency received July, 1967

At present, I have earned 45 credits towards an
Associate of Arts Degree in Criminal Justice at
Essex Community College, Baltimore County, Md.

## EXPERIENCE

January 10, 1964 sworn into the Baltimore City Police Department - finishing
3rd in standing of 27 graduates. Thereafter assigned to the Southeastern
District in uniform patrol that covered high crime areas. During this as-
signment I handled all types of felony and misdemeanor investigations and
arrests.

December 1967 transferred to the Criminal Investigation Division and assigned
to the Vice Control Unit. In this capacity was assigned to undercover work in
the areas of prostitution and gambling violations. While in this assignment,
I kept a low profile and learned to develop sources of select confidential
information.

In May 1968 was promoted to Detective Patrolman and re-assigned to the Crimes
Against Persons Unit Homicide Squad, which is my present assignment. While
in this division, I have personally investigated in the excess of 225 homidices
and have been actively involved with another 150 homicide investigations. I
have also conducted hundreds of investigations into the areas of questionable
death, suicide, serious assault, kidnapping, armed robbery, extortion, threats
of death and hostage situations. For a period of about four years, have also
investigated numerous sex related offenses such as rape, perverted practices,
etc.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

Page 2

As a result of these investigations, I have testified in the Municipal Court,
Criminal Court Supreme Bench, and the Grand Jury systems in the City of Balti-
more and State of Maryland. On most occasions, the Court recognizes me as an
expert in the field of homicides and related death investigations.

During my assignment in the Homicide Squad, I have acted in the capacity of
field supervisor for about 3 1/2 years, supervising 5 to 7 investigators and
their assignments. Have also had the experience of acting undercover while
with the unit and on two occasions I was hired as a paid assassin. During
these operations I worked with several forms of electronic equipment and
became familiar with it.

I am acutely aware of how to search crime scenes; recover and preserve evidence;
examine bodies; interrogate suspects; locate and interview possible witnesses;
take full and formal affadavits and all other areas of homicide investigations.
I furthermore have written and have been named the affiant on numerous search
warrants and seizure orders.

It has been my duty on occasion to travel into other states and jurisdictions
and take custody of fugitives from justice and return them to this city to be
criminally charged.

During my tenure as a law enforcement officer, I have handled numerous line-
ups, surveillances, and details for the protection of suspects, informants and co-
operative witnesses.

I have a full training background in the area of handguns, shotguns, rifle and
tear gas devices.

TRAINING

Have completed the "Francis Lee Glasner" Homicide Seminar, held at the Medical
Examiners Office, Baltimore, Maryland, under the direct supervision of Dr.
Russell Fisher.

Have also attended and completed a "Federal Bureau of Investigation" seminar
on "Homicide and Sex Mutilation", held in Washington, D. C.

Furthermore, I have conducted and attended numerous training classes and pro-
cedure lectures held by the Baltimore City Police Department.

COMMENDATIONS

Since becoming a member of the Baltimore City Police Department in January
1964, I have been awarded the following commendations and citations:

Two Commendation Ribbons
Three Bronze Star Medals of Valor
Six Letters of Commendation
One Certificate of Achievement from
the American Legion

I have recently been recommended by my superior officers for the Department's
Medal of Honor for my actions during a sniper incident and the killing of a
police officer.

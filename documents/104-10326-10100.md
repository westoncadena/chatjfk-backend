5. SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGEABILITY:

A. WASH-32615 APPARENTLY HAS LIMITED

KNOWLEDGEABILITY ABOUT THE GORIZONT PLANT, WHERE SHE WORKED

FOR 25 YEARS, FROM 1966-1991, FIRST AS A TIMEKEEPER AND LATER

AS A TELEVISION SET FINAL TEST TECHNICIAN. WHEN SOURCE FIRST

WENT TO WORK IN THE GORIZONT PLANT IN 1966, IT WAS STILL KNOWN

*AS THE MINSK RADIO PLANT. REPORTEDLY, <LEE HARVEY OSWALD>

WORKED AT THE PLANT WHEN HE LIVED IN MINSK DURING 1959-1960.

THE PLANT MADE MANY ELECTRICAL SPARE PARTS AND PRINTED CIRCUIT

BOARDS FOR THE MILITARY. BY 1972 THE PLANT HAD EXPANDED ITS

FACILITIES TO COVER TWO CITY BLOCKS, AND EMPLOYED ABOUT 10,000

PEOPLE. IN 1972, SOON AFTER IT COMPLETED A NEW SHOP WHICH

MADE WOODEN T.V. CABINETS, AN EXPLOSION AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE

TOTALLY DESTROYED THE T.V. SHOP. ÃšLTIMATELY, THE 51

CENTIMETER (CM) T.V. SET THE PLANT MADE PROVED TO BE LIKE ONE

OF THE BEST QUALITY T.V. SETS IN THE U.S. IN THE EARLY 1970S

THE PLANT MADE SOME TYPES OF SECRET MICROELECTRONIC PRINTED

CIRCUITS WHICH REPORTEDLY WERE USED IN ROCKETS. WASH-32615

KNEW NO DETAILS OF THIS WORK.

B. WASH-32615 CLAIMS SHE TRIED NOT BE BECOME

INVOLVED IN ANY TYPE OF SECRET WORK AT GORIZONT. INDEED, SHE

NEVER HAD A SECRET CLEARANCE. BY 1990 ORDERS FOR THE SECRET

MICROELECTRONIC ITEMS MADE IN SHOP NO. 6 OF THE PLANT WERE

CANCELLED, AND MANY COOPERATIVES WERE STARTED IN THE PLANT.

SHE WORKED IN ONE OF THESE COOPERATIVES, IN THE T.V. SHOP,

WHERE ABOUT 50 EMPLOYEES REMAINED. THESE 50 EMPLOYEES WORKED

SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK, WHENEVER SPARE PARTS FOR THE T.V. SETS

WERE AVAILABLE. BY 1991 T.V. SPARE PARTS WHICH NORMALLY CAME

FROM MANY PLACES IN THE FSU WERE NO LONGER AVAILABLE. THE

COOPERATIVE IN THE T.V. SHOP WAS CALLED "PRAGMA." IT WAS

ORGANIZED BY IGOR ((PITKEVICH)), WHO EXPANDED PRAGMA'S WORK

BEYOND T.V. SETS, TO DEALING IN COMMODITIES AND RAISING AND

SELLING VEGETABLES AND LIVESTOCK. BY EARLY 1991, NO MORE SPARE

PARTS WERE LEFT TO MAKE T.V. SETS, AND ALL MILITARY WORK AT THE

GORIZONT HAD STOPPED. BY AUGUST 1991, WASH-32615 HAD BEEN

FORCIBLY RETIRED. HER RETIREMENT PAY WAS A PALTRY 1,500

RUBLES A MONTH. THE RAPIDLY INCREASING PRICE OF FOOD SOON ATE

UP HER PENSION PAYMENTS. HER FAMILY SURVIVED ONLY BECAUSE SHE

WAS ABLE TO RAISE SOME FOOD ON THE PLOT OF LAND SHE HAD BOUGHT

IN 1989.

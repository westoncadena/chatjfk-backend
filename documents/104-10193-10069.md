Memo for File - William P. Burke

Subject: Longevity Step Increase

In reviewing this file under the Security reinvestigation program, it was noted that the 3rd LSI (as GS-15) was proposed to be made effective on 19 Sept 60, but that the effective date had been changed by Payroll to show 16 Oct 60. Reason for the change is presumed to be due to IWOP. Form 560 shows 225 hours of LWOP during the waiting period. If those figures are correct, then there was no "excess" LWOP, since the law provides that a maximum of 240 hours of LWOP is creditable toward completion of the waiting period in the case of LSI's.

I called this case to the attention of Joe Tracy, C/Payroll, who will review LWOP records and, if required, issue a memorandum to correct the effective date of the last LSI.

William P. Burke, Chief of the New Orleans Field Office,
continues to manage his office in a thoroughly competent and
efficient manner. Mr. Burke is a conservative who sometimes
finds it difficult without most careful and protracted
consideration of all factors involved to adjust to changes in
methods and objectives particularly those peculiar to clandes-
tine support. While his conservatism added to his meticulous
legalistic approach might be something less than desirable in
certain areas it is a definite asset in New Orleans. When
called upon in emergency he willingly and efficiently devotes
his entire time and energy to the solution of the problem
regardless of personal inconvenience. Mr. Burke represents
the Agency well in his area and readily maintains respect in

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant Director for Operations-

SUBJECT: William P. Burke, Memorandum of Performance

1.  William P. Burke, Chief of the New Orleans Field Office, continues to manage his office most efficiently and to demonstrate thorough knowledge of his area. His inherent conservatism and soще-what legalistic approach tend to make it difficult for him to accept change and methods peculiar to clandestine support without most care-ful consideration of all the factors involved.

2.  Mr. Burke represents the Agency well in his area. His conservatism is to a degree an asset in New Orleans; it could conceivably be a handicap elsewhere.

## SECTION E NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANNER OF JOB PERFORMANCE

Stress strengths and weaknesses demonstrated in current position. Indicate suggestions made for improvement of his work. Give recommendations for his training. Describe, if appropriate, his potential for assuming greater responsibilities., Amplify or explain, if appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D to provide the best basis for determining future personnel actions.

Subject possesses complete integrity and thorough knowledge of his area. He is able to assess the potential of sources and to obtain their full cooperation. He is inclined toward a legalistic approach which makes him somewhat less than receptive to new ideas and methods particularly when understanding support of the clandestine services is required. His conservatism is, to an extent, an asset in his area; it could be undesirable in some other assignments.

## APPENDIX "A"

### HISTORY OF EMPLOYMENT
(Sec. 21 in Form 225; Sec. 16 in USGC Std: Form 57)

The following is a complete account of my business and professional activities since my return to New Orleans, from England, in the fall of 1924.

I had obtained a law degree from Harvard in 1923, but, as the law of Louisiana differs in many important respects from the Common Law, I entered Tulane University Law School, in October 1924, to study Louisiana Civil Code subjects. In the afternoons I worked as a researcher for the law firm of Spencer, Philips, Phelphs and Dunbar, (now Phelps, Dunbar, Marks and Claverie) 100 United Fruit Co. Bldg., in New Orleans, La.

In July 1925 I received the degree of LLB from Tulane, passed the Louisiana Bar examinations, and entered practice as an associate of the firm named above. My salary was, as I recall it, $100.00 per month, plus 75% of the fees on the business which I originated. Such fees were negligible. My work consisted in research on matters assigned by partners of the firm, and the handling of minor matters of litigation.

There were clients of the Spencer firm and the New Orleans Bank & Trust Co., a small bank which had been organized a few years previously. In 1928 the bank decided to open a Trust Department, and offered me the job of organizing and running it, at a salary of $4800.00 per year. I accepted, organized the department and operated it successfully until 1931. My work consisted in collecting bills, trusts and custodianship accounts, investing the funds of beneficiaries, administering estates and handling receiverships.

In 1931 the discount department of the New Orleans Bank & Trust Co. got into difficulties, and, for the protection of the depositors, the entire bank was taken over by the Interstate Trust & Banking Co., of New Orleans. No loss was suffered by any of the customers of the Trust Department. I became assistant Trust Officer of the Interstate Bank, and could have remained there indefinitely, but I disliked the environment and the policies of the management, and I could see very little prospect for advancement, so I resigned when the trust business had been transferred.

In the fall of 1931 I organized a corporation which was to erect a moving-letter sign on Canal St., similar to the one on the Times Building in New York. Revenues were to be derived from the sale of advertising which would be included among news dispatches. It proved impossible, however, to sell sufficient contracts to make the operation profitable, and I liquidated the corporation in the early part of 1932.

Two of my classmates at Tulane, Herbert B. Deutch and W. Scott Morrison had been practicing law together since graduation, and were becoming quite successful. They asked me to join them, and, after the summer of 1932, I became a partner of the firm of Deutsch, Kerrigan & Burke. For the next five years we engaged in the general civil practice of law in all City, State and Federal Courts. Among others, we represented the Illinois Central Railroad, the Higgins Industries, the Whitney National Bank, the Standard Oil Company of Louisiana, the Item Co., Ltd., publisher of one of the local daily papers, the Standard Steamship Co., and a number of insurance companies, and local corporations and individuals.

My work covered the whole field of civil corporate and individual practice: the preparation of pleadings, interviewing witnesses, conducting litigation, writing briefs, arguing cases in the instant and appellate courts, examining titles, administering estates, handling taxation matters, etc. My income averaged approximately $7000.00 per annum.

I resigned from the firm in 1937 and continued practice, as an individual, with offices in the Canal Bank Building, until I entered military service in 1942. My income during that period varied between five and eight thousand dollars.

I was on active duty in the Marine Corps from September 1 to December 1945. While I was overseas my mother died, leaving a considerable estate. I was named executor in her will, and, after my return, spent several months in administering


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

the estate, transfering the securities and working out same rather complicated taxation matters.

I had decided, while in service, that I did not want to return to active lέν. practise. The clients I had had before the war vere being adequately served by other attorneys, and it would have meant starting all over again from scratch. I did not want to do that, so I bogan looking for a business in which i could invest capital and my services. Naturally, I have found quite a fos, birt nous, an yot, which meste my requirements.

## MILITARY SERVICE.

APPENDIX "Б"

(Sec. 16. in Form 2205; Sec. 17 in USSSC Std. Form 57)

In the spring of 1942 the war came pretty close to New Orleans. There were sub-marines in the Gulf, tankers were being torpedoed as they left the river, and the hospital's were filled with horribly burned seamen. I was anxious to do what I could, but I felt that at my age there was little hope of taking an active part. I became an Air Raid warden, and helped sell some war Bonds, and I thought that was about all I would be able to do.

Then the Marine Corps came out with an announcement that commissions were open in Aviation Intelligence to men up to 45 years of age.I saw the Recruiting Officer, and he recommended me for such a commission. Nothing happened for some time, so when I was next in Washington on business I went to Marine Corps Headquarters and looked p upColonel Belford, whom I had known in New Orleans.

He ascertained that Aviation Intelligence was filled up, but stated that he would be glad to have me in the Recruiting Division, and that I might transfer to Aviation Intelligence later on. I was delighted to get into the Marine Corps, and accepted a commission as Captain on 8 September 1942.

After an indoctrination course at Quantico, Va., I was ordered to San Antonio, Tex., as assistant recruiting officer. I remained there for three months, devoting most of my time to the Student Officer procurement program in the various Texas colleges.

In December, 1942, the Marine Corps, which had, prior to that time, been an exclusively volunteer organization, was placed under the Selective Service System, and Marine Corps Headquarters decided to follow the lead of the Navy and appoint a Marine officer as liaison to each state Selective Service Headquarters. I was one of those appointed, and was ordered to Raleigh, N.C. on 12 January 1943.

The post at Raleigh was one of some importance because of the large Marine Corps bases at New River, Cherry Point and Edenton, at which over one hundred thousand Marines were in training and at which construction and maintenance programs involving several hundred millions of dollars were in operation. It was my duty to supervise the induction of all North Carolina selectees who were assigned to the Marine Corps through the Selective Service System, and to represent the various Marine Corps installations in their dealings and disputes with local draft boards concerning the deferment of about five thousand civilian employees.

In addition, I took an active part in the administration of the Selective Service Headquarters in Raleigh and throughout the state, interviewing registrants, their employers and dependents, advising local area appeal boards, setting up replacement schedules for various industries and passing on the merits of about eleven thousand appeals.

The work was interesting and productive, and living in Raleigh was certainly "good duty", but I had never lost my desire for overseas duty and made two attempts to transfer to Aviation, both of which were unsuccessful. Then, in September 1944 I heard that Marine Divisions overseas were badly in need of Legal Officers, and I immediately applied for transfer. I was ordered to headquarters for indoctrination, and, after a tour of duty in the office of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, I was sent to Camp Lejeune in February 1945 for further training. In April 1945 I sailed from San Francisco, and in May I joined the Fourth Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force, Pacific, at Maui, as Division legal officer. I continued in that post until the war ended and I procured a transfer to the inactive list.

A Marine Division consists of approximately 18,000 NC men. The Division Legal Officer is directly responsible to the Commanding General for the administration of Military Justice throughout the command, and supervises the work and findings of all General, Summary and Deck Courts, as well as those of all Boards of Investigation and Courts of Inquiry. To advise the Commanding General on the action to be taken as Convening Authority or Immediate Superior in Command. In addition he advises the Commanding General and Chief of Staff on all legal matters arising out of contact with natives, with civilian and military authorities and with the owners of training areas

used by the troops. L'oreover, he acts as legal Assistance Officer to the Division, which involved, during my term of office, the giving of legal advice and service to about eight hundred Individuals.

I returned to the United States on 25 October 1945, and completed my terminal leave on 10 Docomber 1945.

During sy term of service my superiora rendered reperta on my fitness each ninoty days. All of those reperts were favorable, and many of the contained carsn-dations.

The scale within each category is divided into three small blocks: this is to allow you to make finer distinctions if you so desire. Look at each statement on the left then check the category on the right which best tells how much the statement applies to the person you are rating.

Placing an "X" in the "Does Not Apply" column means that you have a definite opinion that the description is not at all suited to the individual.

Dear Mr. Camp:

I am today in receipt of your letter of 1 December 1954 concerning Mr. Clapp's visit and Mr. McBride.

I was not in New Orleans at the time when Mr. Clapp was here and accordingly did not have the pleasure of seeing him.

I am sorry that Mr. Clapp did not succeed in making contact with Mr. McBride. If I happen to learn or a more recent address of Mr. McBride, I shall pass the information on to you.

ITASHANTM FOR: Deputy Director (Intelligence).

SUBJECT:

Commendation of DDI Personnel

1. For the past several months my office has had an urgent and a continuing need for intelligence about Guatemala--for intelligence in such variety that at one time or another almost every DDI component contributed.

2. Each of them -- offices as well as individuals within the DD/I area -- responded with a highly impressive alacrity and completeness. Their contributions were thorough in their coverage and fast in their preparation.

3. It is difficult to cite the work of particular individuals and components of DD/T, because much inconspicuous but essential labor must never have come to my attention. Risking the chance that such work might unfairly go unrecognized, I nevertheless believe that the work of the following individuals and units deserves special recognition:

John V. Armstrong, Wilton H. Brown, Archie C. Bush and David L. Campa, OCI.

Miss Dorothy A. Bradas, William P. Burke, Hunter J. Lease and Lloyd A. Ray, New Orleans field office, OO/C.

William Buchanan, Kansas City field office, OO/C.

Miss Betty Didcoct and David F. Haley, Geography Division, ORR.

Norman E. Greenawalt, Charles D. Stockton, Milton S. Venezky and Robert J. Voskuil, Cartography Division, ORR.

Zygmund Lenchert, Richard V. Stamp and John E. Wilson, Photo Intelligence Division, ORR.

Harry A. McCrea and David S. McLean, OO/C.

Lawrence Snitzler, New York field office, OO/C.

SECRET

- 2 -

Office of Research and Reports which put its major resources at our disposal. ORR's geographic research area freely gave us the time of trained cartographers and interpreters. Without their skills, and the endless hours they applied those skills for us, our operations would have been most difficult. ORR's economic research area contributed less only because we asked for less economic intelligence was not as vital as geographic intelligence to this operation. In addition, the major economic contribution was recognized and commended in my 7 June 1954 memorandum to you.

Foreign Broadcast Information Division which monitored Guatemalan and related broadcasts with more than its usual care, and, among other special activities, arranged a direct wire service so that our field headquarters unit received the monitored broadcasts immediately. The entire division turned to its task with such unity that singling out for commendation the work of any of its people is impossible.

Foreign Documents Division which gave us translations quickly and in the priority needed. Its service was the more remarkable for its lack of a Western Hemisphere unit. Initiative, flexibility, and willingness were substituted for this organizational lack.

![illegible] station which provided a wide variety of services we requested, and on its own initiative proposed other useful services. collection of Central American intelligence information by the net-work of domestic field stations, it carefully watched the southern ports of entry into the United States on a regular basis, it provided us with commercial news clipping services and the texts of news broadcasts, and it located, surveyed in many cases interviewed Guatemalans within the United States in whom we were interested.

CIA Library, especially its Book Branch. All components, however contributed. Its clipping service was reliable, alert, and keen to render maximum service. The Information Section promptly handled numerous spot requests and gave resourceful assistance well beyond the confines of its routine duties. The Book Branch surveyed periodical and scholarly literature meticulously, and thus uncovered such information useful to a psychological campaign.

Graphics Register whose Photo Branch and Film Branch both gave services much beyond the normal course of duty, and showed ingenuity in locating and preparing special materials.

Office Memorandum • UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

TO : Executive for Administration and Management DATE: SEP 15 1949

FROM : Assistant Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Recommendation for Promotion of Mr. William Patrick Burko, Jr.

1. It is requested that the attached recommendation for promotion of Mr. William P. Burke, Jr. from P-7 to P-8 be approved even though Mr. Burke has not served the required time in-grade as established in Paragraph 4c of Administrative Instruction No. 20-1. This recommendation is based upon the fact he has served in his present capacity as Acting Chief, New Orleans Office, 00/C, for approximately one year and his performance of duty has been outstanding.

2. Mr. Burke entered on duty as Acting Chief, New Orleans Office, 00/C, on 9 September 1947 in which capacity he is still serving. The position of Chief, New Orleans Office, has been allocated as a P-8.

3. Subsequent to assuming his duties as Acting Chief of the New Orleans Office, Mr. Burke displayed great initiative and unusual ability in planning his organization and without any loss of time, placed it on a highly productive basis. Mr. Burke has not overlooked any possible sources of intelligence within his area, and is submitting extremely valuable reports, particularly those that pertain to Latin America. In addition, Mr. Burke's office has produced comprehensive reports on the intolligence potentialities of Houston, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma, convincing this office that field offices in both localities will be justified.

4. Mr. Burke's accomplishments as Acting Chief, New Orleans Office have been outstanding. Due to his unusual leadership the morale of his office personnel has been maintained at a high level, despite heavy working conditions.

5. Mr. Burke received an A.B. degree from Loyola University, New Orleans, in 1919 and LLB degrees from Harvard Law School and Tulane University in 1923 and 1925 respectively. Ir. addition, he spent one year of study at Cambridge University, England. Upon graduation from law school, he became affiliated with various prominent law firms in New Orleans, and in 1937 established his own firm which he operated on a successful level until his entry into the military service during World War II.

6. Mr. Burke has an outstanding military record, having served approximately three years in the U. S. Larine Corps during World War II, and being honorably released from duty with the rank

of Major: During his tour of duty with the U. S. Karine Corps, he served in the capacity of liaison officer with Selective Service and later, as legal officer with the Fourth Karine Division in the Pacific.

7. By reason of his civilian and military experience and wide acquaintanceship in New Orleans, Mr. Burke is exceptionally well qualified for his present assignment and is performing his duties in an outstanding manner. In view of his superior accomplishments and contributions to the successful operation of the Contact Branch, it is strongly recommended that Wr. Burke's promotion to the grade of P-8 be approved...

P. O. Box 1016
New Orleans, ?, Louisiana

Dear Bill:

Prior to leaving CIA, I want to record my sincere appreciation of the fine job done by you in New Orleans.

Your achievement is all the more noteworthy when it is remembered that you started in your city singlehanded and with little guidance or precedence. Within the space of less than a year, you have created an effective field office which is now making a significant contribution to national intelligence.

Inspections reveal that your relations with the local Armed Forces representatives as well as with your clients are excellent. Noted also is the high morale in your office.

Please accept my congratulations for this splendid record and accept my gratitude for your local support.

With best wishes for your continued success,

Very sincerely.

INSTRUCTIONS TO APPOINTING OFFICER

The appointing officer before whom the foregoing certificate is made shall determine to his own satisfaction that this appointment would be in conformance with the Civil Service Act, applicable civil service rules, the War Service Regulations, and acts of Congress pertaining to appointment.

This form should be checked for holding of office, pension, purchase of office, suitability in connection with any record of desertion or arrest, promise to observe provisions regarding political activity and particularly for the following:

(1) Identity of appointee with the applicant whose appointment was authorized. The appointee's signature and handwriting are to be compared with the application and or other pertinent papers. The physical appearance may be checked with the medical certificate. The appointee may also be questioned on his personal history for agreement with his statements.

(2) Age. If the discrepancy exists between the date of birth and that on application and if definite, is in any event excessive for the position, it should be determined that applicant is not outside the age range for appointment.

(3) Citizenship. The responsibility for observing the provisions of appropriation acts prohibiting or restricting the employment of aliens rests with the appointing officer. The Civil Service Commission indicates on applications showing foreign birth whether citizenship has been verified. The appointing officer should verify citizenship at the list of eligibles or the letter of authority from the Commission, unless the requirement is waived by proof of citizenship, or if the applicant has presented an application on its face that citizenship has been proved. If the answer to question 4 of this form shows foreign birth and the application indicates residence in the United States, the case should be referred to the Civil Service Commission.

(4) Members of Family. - Section 9 of the Civil Service Act provides that where there are two or more members of the family in the classified service, no other member of such family is eligible for appointment in that service. Minors do not establish a different family merely by living at an address different from that of the parents. Doubtful cases involving more than two members of family, or indicating an apparent misrepresentation, should be referred to the Civil Service Commission with all information presentatives for decision. Under War Service Regulations the one member of family provision does not apply to temporary appointments for one year or less.

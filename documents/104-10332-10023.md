Re: JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992

Dear Mr. Tunheim:

This will respond to your 14 September 1998 letter regarding Central Intelligence Agency compliance with the "JFK Act."

I have no doubt whatsoever that the CIA has fully met its obligations to locate, review, and release "assassination records" as defined in the JFK Act. The Agency's 2 September 1998 Declaration of Compliance-signed, as you note, by CIA's Director of Information Management, Edmund Cohen-confirms my judgment. I have full confidence in the scope of the Agency's searches as described in Mr. Cohen's recent declaration.

As Director of Information Management, Mr. Cohen is directly responsible for CIA's records systems and for ensuring the adequacy of CIA's search, review, and release of documents under the JFK Act. Mr. Cohen signed the Agency's Declaration of Compliance because he was the most senior Agency official with direct personal knowledge that its statements were accurate and complete. There was no more appropriate signatory.

In sum, I understand that the appropriate CIA staff officers have worked diligently to locate and disclose to the JFK Board all relevant records in the Agency's possession and that they do not believe any other relevant records are being withheld from the Board. Mr. Cohen's declaration confirms my understanding.

I trust that this will meet your requirements.

Sincerely,

![signature of George J. Tenet]

## Universe and Scope of CIA Documents

## Addressed Related to the JFK Assassination

**Summary.** This Attachment discusses CIA material examined in order to fulfill the requirements of the JFK Assassinations Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act). It addresses the types of CIA documents found in the records of earlier investigations, including that of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and materials and files recovered in response to searches conducted in 1992 and thereafter. It discusses the process by which documents became "assassination-related records."

**Discussion.** The Central Intelligence Agency has provided large numbers of documents and materials over the years in support of successive reviews and investigations related to the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy. We estimate that the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages comprise the "CIA collection" of documents associated with prior assassination reviews, including duplicates. In addition, we estimate that in responses to the JFK Act, CIA has reviewed over 100,000 pages of documents from the National Archives, the Ford, Johnson, and Kennedy Presidential Libraries and miscellaneous papers from the National Security Council, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), the Rockefeller Commission on CIA Activities Within the United States, and the Senate Select (Church) Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.

The documentation exists in many forms, from original contemporaneous material, such as field reporting from overseas or analytic reports, to material generated specifically as an Agency response to investigation questions. The largest "CIA collection," as such, is associated with the records of the House Select Committee on


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 11

# Assassinations (HSCA).[^1]
The HSCA brought together in one place in 1978 the principal documents retrieved over the course of years from earlier investigations, including the Warren Commission, the Rockefeller Commission, and the Church Committee.

The Warren Commission in 1963 and 1964 was the first major review of the JFK Assassination. Existing records suggest that CIA provided roughly 4,000 pages of documentation to the Warren Commission review, plus testimony by Richard Helms and John McCone. The Warren Commission pursued matters related primarily to events and actions directly associated with the assassination event, including materials from CIA's Mexico City Station, which were considered relevant because of a visit to Mexico City by Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the assassination.

The Rockefeller Commission in 1975 and Church Committee investigation in 1975 and 1976 were focused on allegations of wrongdoing by the CIA. Nonetheless, as a part of these investigations they yielded information which, to many, appeared to relate in some way to the assassination, such as an operational capability or willingness to consider assassination as an intelligence method.

From 1976 through 1979 the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) pursued additional leads, generating still further documentation. The HSCA ultimately brought together within its broad scope of investigation many of the documents from the Warren Commission, the Rockefeller Commission and the Church Committee. This collection ultimately became the "HSCA sequestered collection," which altogether contains an equivalent of over 300,000 pages, in paper, photographs, tapes, and microfilm media, including duplicates. Because the myriad conspiracy theories included possible Soviet, Cuban, Mafia or right-wing American involvement, the scope of the HSCA investigation included anything or anyone that might appear to support those theories, including historical institutional behavior patterns. Further, although this sequestered collection was considered to be CIA's, it contains documents from other agencies, primarily the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and over 30,000 pages of HSCA originated material.

[^1]: The HSCA sequestered collection reflects the major corpus of CIA material or information reviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (or to which they had access) during the 1976-1979 time frame. The pulling together of this collection was coordinated by the Committee and they defined what it was to include. This Collection has been physically held by CIA since 1979, although CIA was not authorized access until 1992, when permission was given by Congress to review the material in preparation for responding to the JFK Act.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 12

The HSCA sequestered collection is contained in 64
boxes of multimedia material, including paper, photographs,
and microfilm which have been loosely organized into major
categories of information. Boxes 1 through 34 are mostly
material collected by the CIA's Directorate of Operations,
the FBI, and other Government agencies, including field
reporting and handwritten notes. They also include
newspaper articles, name traces performed in response to
requests by the HSCA staff, and copies of other documents
such as the CIA Inspector General's 1967 report on CIA plots
against Castro and Richard Helms' executive session
testimony before the HSCA.

Boxes 35 through 63 of this collection are largely
records of CIA's Legislative Counsel, Inspector General,
General Counsel, Office of Security, and Directorate of
Science and Technology, as well as internal records of the
HSCA staff. They consist of reports, memoranda,
transcripts, cables, letters, newspaper clippings,
photographs, and charts. Box 64 contains 72 reels of
microfilm-the equivalent of roughly 72 more boxes of paper
documents. This material includes the file which the
Directorate of Operations maintained on Lee Harvey Oswald
(the 201 file) as well as similar files on additional
individuals. Many of the microfilm documents duplicate
other documents in the other boxes.

While not a part of the sequestered collection, a
separate "Oswald 201 File" has served as a CIA repository
for JFK assassination-related material over the years and to
a large extent material in this file is duplicative of
material in the sequestered collection. Only a few
documents were in the file at the time of the assassination.
The bulk of the approximately 26,000 pages currently in this
file consists of documents collected immediately after the
assassination and during the Warren Commission
investigation. Included are a large number of third agency
documents, primarily from the FBI. Other major additions to
the Oswald 201 file include relevant Mexico City Station
files and material generated by various FOIA requests and
investigations, such as that of New Orleans District
Attorney, James Garrison.

Assassination-related materials beyond the sequestered
collection and the Oswald 201 file which have been located
since 1992 generally fall into three categories. First,
there are new documents which have been generated since
1978, such as defector reports that mention rumors or
perceptions of conspiracies or newspaper or other open

3


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 13

source materials related to an individual associated with
the assassination. Second, in a number of cases targeted
areas of inquiry or more precise definitions of areas of
interest by the JFK Board have yielded more information and
added documents to the collection. And third, improved
search techniques have provided better access to those files
which are searchable electronically. Nonetheless, the
material located since 1992 is quite small when compared to
the material in the sequestered collection and the overall
set of material from CIA which has been designated as
"assassination records" by the JFK Board.

In accordance with the law, the Board has the authority
to designate records which it considers relevant to the
assassination as "Assassination Records." These documents
are then subject to review for declassification or, as
deemed appropriate by the Board, held for declassification
in the year 2017. The Board has designated the entire
sequestered collection as Assassination Records as well as
selected material generated in the course of searches
subsequent to 1992. The entire set of these documents is
the equivalent of roughly 320,000 pages, including
duplicates.

## Search Methodology and Types of Searches Conducted

Summary. This Attachment discusses the methodologies used in conducting the searches, including what we know of the searches which were conducted on behalf of the earlier assassination investigations. It includes, in referenced tabs, documentation of selected taskings. It discusses the distributed nature of CIA's paper recordkeeping systems and electronic databases and the custom keyword searches that are used with electronic databases which CIA maintains.

Discussion. The collection of CIA materials contained in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) "sequestered collection" has existed as a discrete body of records since 1978. This material resulted from highly labor intensive and systematic searches by individuals familiar with the Agency's paper files and records systems in use in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, the sequestered collection comprises the great bulk of CIA-originated documents which can be associated with the JFK Assassination and related investigations.

For most of its history, the Agency has had a system of records which has been shaped by the divergent requirements of the directorates in accordance with the wide variance of focus in their missions. These basic differences in the missions of the directorates, as well as the compartmental-ization-of-information procedures (the "need-to-know" concept), have resulted in each directorate keeping its own set of records in accordance with directorate-specific guidelines. This applies equally to paper records as well as to electronic databases.

Since the late 1970s, the Agency has been in the process of converting to electronic databases, which allow for electronic searches for documents using keyword and

[^2]

[^2]: Even within a single database, information may--in accordance with information compartmentalization requirements based on the need-to-know principle--be stored in separate files by several offices or divisions, each with its distinct recordkeeping criteria and access requirements. In order for a search to be thorough, a search for one term or a combination of terms must be conducted across all such files.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 16

other indexing tools which provide much more expedited and efficient searches. Because the most significant portion of JFK assassination-related material was generated prior to this conversion to electronic databases, searches of the sequestered collection or other contemporaneous CIA records have had to rely primarily upon labor intensive hand searches.

Since 1992 and the passage of the JFK Act, CIA has, in responding to the requests of the Board, had to devise search methodologies and techniques to address both the hard copy and electronic versions of our databases. With respect to the hard copy material, Agency efforts have concentrated on those component records most likely to yield assassination-related documents. Short of a complete manual review of all documents in the Agency, the techniques used for searching hard copy materials include expert reviews of file series and folder names, including associations with known related topics, retrieving boxes of files from the Agency's Archives and Records Center, and manually reviewing those files identified as likely to contain the sought after materials.

Electronic files searches can actually be more complex than manual searches, in major part because of the number of different electronic systems in use. The Directorate of Operations' electronic databases, for instance, include most cables since 1978 and they can be searched using single or multiple search terms against the full text of these cables. The Directorate of Intelligence's automated systems include original source material used for analytic assessments as well as the products themselves and can be searched through a variety of electronic techniques. The DCI Area (considered, for this purpose a directorate) maintains the Executive Registry files which are not normally retrievable through full text search, but by index searches. The Directorate of Administration maintains a large and diverse system of databases and files on employees and contractors that includes data on security issues, medical records, training, etc. The Directorate of Science and Technology and its subordinate components maintain other electronic databases unique to individual missions. Each of these systems requires a unique set of access criteria and search commands and must be searched by information management experts of the respective directorates.

Where possible, automated systems were searched using key words such as JFK, Kennedy, assassination, executive action, Oswald, place names, and a large number of names, crypts, or pseudonyms identifying individuals known to have

2


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

been associated with countries, key installations, organizations, or operations that fell within the period deemed relevant to the history of the assassination.

The following categories are examples of the guidelines for relevancy with which both manual and computerized searches were conducted. They include, but are not limited to, individuals, organizations, places, projects, and subjects which are considered central to the Oswald/JFK assassination history and the ensuing investigations.

A. JFK Assassination Investigations:

*   Warren Commission, 1963-64
*   James Garrison, New Orleans District Attorney, 1966-68
*   Rockefeller Commission, 1975 (JFK assassination & CIA anti-Cuban plots aspects only)
*   Church Committee (Senate), 1975-76 (JFK assassination & CIA anti-Cuban plots aspects only)
*   House Select Committee On Assassinations (HSCA), 1976-79

B. Key Subjects:

*   Moscow Station, Mexico City Station, and JMWAVE Station, as they related to Oswald's activities or to possible conspiracies.
*   KGB interest in Oswald.
*   CIA anti-Cuban operations 1960-64 if they involve JFK figures or subjects; most US anti-Castro activities in 1963 are considered relevant.
*   Cuban exile anti-Castro activities, leaders, and organizations, 1960-64, if they involve JFK figures or subjects.
*   Castro assassination activities (plans and attempts) without limit on time frame.
*   Mafia, if related to Castro, JFK, or New Orleans during Oswald time frames.

C. Key Figures: Material with the following terms was considered JFK assassination-relevant unless the context is clearly not related or the information is outside the appropriate time period:

*   AMLASH
*   AMMUG
*   Maurice Bishop (any reference)
*   Silvia Duran

Prior to enactment of the JFK Act, in early 1992, the Chief of the CIA History Staff, through various manual searches of shelf lists, located the "sequestered collection" of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (sixty-four record center size boxes). After obtaining the permission of the Congress, his staff surveyed these and other related holdings on the assassination. In addition, the History Staff located sixteen boxes of Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file and a number of loose folders, mainly from Mexico City Station records that had been collected for the Warren Commission.

In October 1993, following enactment of the JFK Act but prior to the President's appointment of the Board, CIA'S Historical Review Group (HRG) requested the directorates to conduct a name search on Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK assassination, and any related documents (Tab 1). This request resulted in a series of meetings and discussions with various Agency components and Information Release Officers. More than thirty-one additional boxes of materials were sent to HRG for review. Included in this material were nineteen boxes of JFK working files of Mr. Russ Holmes, a CIA employee who for many years was the Agency's focal point officer with responsibility for responding to questions related to our assassinated-related records. Also included were two boxes on Nosenko, seven boxes of Latin America Division documents, and three boxes from the Bay of Pigs project. Out of these thirty-one additional boxes provided to the Board staff, approximately twenty-two boxes of material were designated by the Board as assassination records. The preponderant volume of these records is duplicative of documents in the sequestered collection.

In April 1995, after the Agency received the Board's first formal request, and in anticipation of "what are


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

likely to be many requests from the Board for information..." the Agency Executive Director asked each directorate and the DCI Administrative Officer to appoint a focal point officer for the JFK Assassination review. (Tab 2)

In the spring and summer of 1997, the Agency arranged for the Board staff to receive a series of briefings by representatives of each directorate on the files kept within the records systems of each directorate. These briefings covered aspects of the records systems, such as how the records are organized, maintained, searched and retrieved, as well as how they had been previously searched for assassination-related materials.

The Board staff requested a number of additional searches, which have now been completed. These requests were both formal and informal and resulted in responses to the Board staff which included a wide range of additional material, some of which was judged relevant to the history of the assassination. This material includes the histories of various CIA operations and Agency components, files on specific individuals involved in either the Warren Commission or in HSCA investigations, and the results of CIA internal reviews of programs and operations. Although many requests from the Board and responses from the Agency were handled informally, the significant initial requests are listed in the table in Attachment V.

Prompted in part by the surfacing of a small number of new relevant documents, the Board staff requested CIA in the summer of 1998 to: (a) perform an additional set of searches on certain specific topics; and (b) issue an Agency-wide notice reminding CIA employees of the requirements of the JFK Act.

Specially tailored tasking was sent to the three Directorate of Operations components deemed most likely to possess records relevant to the JFK assassination of the kind of concern to the Board (See Tab 3). Among other considerations, this special tasking included a list of new or revised search terms, a request for clarification on the disposition of the James Angleton files, and the requirement to focus on potential new information from the debriefing of defectors in which any reference to Oswald or to the Kennedy assassination occurs.

DCI Tenet issued an Agency-wide Employees Bulletin on 22 July 1998 directing all CIA personnel to "consider documents in their possession or with which they are

5


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

familiar that might have relevance to the Board's review..."
(ΕΒ ΟΙΜ 98-02-See Tab 4).

Finally, and in a separate tasking, all directorates were asked to assure that searches undertaken were sufficient to enable a directorate representative to provide a certification of compliance with the JFK Act, and that the DCI's Bulletin had been forwarded to all directorate employees. (See Tab 5).

1. (U) The JFK Board has made a number of recent specific directed requests to assure that the Agency has complied fully with the requirements of the JFK Act. Among these was a request for issuance of the Reference Employee Bulletin, in which the DCI directed that employees leave "no stone unturned" in assuring that relevant documents are provided to the Commission.

2. (U) In part because relevant new documents have surfaced within the past few months, the Board has also requested specific focus on renewed searches of the Agency's "counterintelligence files." The new documents have surfaced due to a variety of reasons, including references to assassination related personalities in recent defector reports, records made available because of the break up of the Soviet Union, and advances in search capabilities due to digitization of older paper files.

SUBJECT: (U) New Search of CI Files for JFK Assassination Records

3. In discussions with the Board staff we have attempted to focus any new tasking on those areas in which they have expressed their greatest concern. It is imperative, however, that we satisfy the Board on these issues or the Agency will be subject to a determination by the Board that we are not in compliance with the JFK Act. Because of the impending statutory termination of the Board and their need to issue their report, there is some urgency associated with the conduct and completion of these searches. The searches must be completed by 6 August, 1998.

4. (S) Databases to be Searched. The addressees to this memorandum are requested to perform new searches--using the search terms in paragraph 5--on ANY of your files which may contain information relating in any way to the JFK assassination, including, in particular, all records systems or files containing information on:

*   James J. Angleton and his files
*   Debriefings of defectors in which ANY reference to Oswald or the JFK assassination occurs (Example [I JDECANTER])

5. (U) Search Terms and Time Periods. These new searches should focus on documents that might be retrievable with the following search terms over the referenced periods:

*   The period 1959-1965 using the search terms Executive Action, Exaction, Ex Action.
*   Post-1978 information combining the term "assassination" with President Kennedy, John F. Kennedy, Kennedy, JFK, presidential threats, threats to U.S. President, attempt (or attempted), or the crypt GPIDEAL.
*   Post-1978 information related to the following terms: Warren Commission, House Select Committee on Assassinations, HSCA, Oswald, Lee Harvey Oswald, Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby, or GPFLOOR.

# FINAL DOCUMENT SEARCH TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH "PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992" (JFK ACT)

FROM:
George J. Tenet
Director of Central Intelligence

1. (U) As you know, the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (Board) is completing its task of overseeing the search and declassification of all Federal government records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy by 30 September 1998. The Board and we want to do everything possible to place before the American people the full story as reflected in government and other records.

2. (U) The Agency has been working on this effort since 1992 and has searched all of the obvious databases. We want to make certain that we have left no stone unturned and that no employee has any records that might possibly be considered relevant to the assassination—including any records created [or received] after 1992. The reference to 1992 is largely intended to encompass documents which may have come into our hands since the collapse of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact.

3. (AIUO) In accordance with the provisions of the JFK Act, I hereby direct all CIA personnel to consider documents in their possession or with which they are familiar that might have relevance to the Board's review and that might not have been found in the course of electronic or manual searches over the past six years. Representatives of the Historical Review Program believe that if such documents do exist they would, most likely, be found in files that would not be generally related to the assassination or that would not be "logical" areas for systematic searches. These include working paper files or smaller databases related to countries not normally associated with the assassination. Relevant documents can be in the form of papers, photographs, recordings, tapes, or other media, and can include documents "related to the assassination," such as later investigations, key topics/events within the Oswald/JFK Story, or material related to key figures—such as Nosenko.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 30

4. (AIUO) CIA personnel who believe they have information regarding documents relevant
   to the JFK review that may not have been found in previous searches should contact their
   component or directorate IRO or the JFK Project Coordinator. Directorate IROs and the
   Agency's JFK Project Coordinator are as follows:

# Attachment III

Records Declassified and Released.

**Summary.** This Attachment discusses the process used by CIA to declassify JFK assassination-related documents, including interaction with the Board and subsequent re-reviews of materials, as well as the personnel resources engaged in this effort. It discusses the volumes of records reviewed, the volumes of records declassified, and the manner in which the material has or will be made available to the public.

**Discussion.** In response to the enactment of the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 and in anticipation of the appointment of the Review Board, CIA, during 1992 and 1993, reviewed for declassification material which had been sequestered following the investigation of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in 1978. As a result of this effort, CIA released as declassified to the National Archives in August 1993 some 127,000 pages of material from this collection. Since that time, additional releases have been made; approximately 74,000 pages from the microfilm part of the collection were declassified and released in August 1994 and 30,000 pages of HSCA originated material were declassified and released in 1995. We estimate that, since 1992, CIA has devoted over 100 work years to its effort to respond to the JFK Act (including experienced annuitants working as independent contractors).

The development of the declassification review methodology was, from the beginning in 1992, an iterative process that took into account both the requirements of the JFK Act to release to the public information relevant to an understanding of the assassination and the DCI's statutory mandate to protect intelligence sources and methods under the National Security Act of 1947 and the CIA Act of 1949.

In the years since 1992, considerable effort has been expended to balancing these two objectives. Interaction with the Board's staff was a significant factor in reaching this proper balance. The net result is that practices over this period evolved to the extent that types of material that had been redacted at the beginning of the process were, by the end, no longer considered necessary to withhold. This has, of course, required a further re-review of the material released during the earlier period to assure that


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 36

consistent standards were being used for the entire collection.

Each document in the collection was read by an Historical Review Program (HRP) Reviewer in every case a retired officer with at least two decades of Agency experience who examined every word in the document with an eye toward releasing documents unless such release could be expected to cause damage to:

*   Human intelligence assets or their families;
*   Intelligence methodology clearly requiring continued protection;
*   Intelligence operations or activities warranting continued protection, including relationships with foreign governments.

The reviewed documents were then passed to teams of officers from the components that generated the documents (in most cases the Directorate of Operations), who were responsible for determining current sensitivity. The senior HRP reviewers validated the component groups' actions prior to forwarding the materials to the Board.

Names of CIA employees who served all or most of their careers under cover posed particular problems and, while many names have been redacted, with Board concurrence for release at a later date, the current sensitivity, or lack thereof, of retired individuals' employment by CIA had to be checked in each case. Names of key players in the post- assassination scenario, as stipulated by the Board, were released as true names or with temporary and traceable substitute names. Identification by the Board of those who were considered key players was a complicated and time- consuming task. Significant review and analysis went into the decision to release true names of many Cubans connected with the Bay of Pigs.

Material from the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee investigations, presidential libraries and PFIAB files which addressed the entire scope of CIA activities raised issues with respect to relevance to the JFK assassination. For example, Project MONGOOSE, a clandestine portion of the publicly acknowledged U.S. anti-Castro policy, was released.

Another major issue was consistency in reviewing duplicate copies of documents. In one case 47 copies of a cable were found by different reviewers in separate files

2


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

over the six years of our review process. The National
Archives ground rules called for release of every copy for
inclusion in the NARA collection; therefore, each of these
47 copies is included as part of the total collection. As
duplicate copies were found, comparison with the 1993
released version revealed not only inconsistencies but
textual phrasing which, in a mosaic of related documents,
made likely the identification of a protected individual or
action. As a result, much re-review of the files was
required and did occur.

Another time-consumer was the question of the
identification of overseas station locations, traditionally
not revealed--both to protect Agency individuals, activities
and sources and to avoid foreign relations difficulties with
foreign governments. In these cases, a window of time for
acknowledgment of such facilities was negotiated, directly
relevant to such actions as Oswald's travels and post-
assassination requests for foreign government assistance in
the U.S. investigation.

Except for redaction of names of CIA employees, true
names of clandestine agents (otherwise identified with
traceable cryptonyms), and currently-sensitive cooperation
with specific foreign intelligence services, the final
collection in the National Archives will contain very
limited redactions and, in our opinion, none that would
affect an historian's understanding of the Agency's
information on, and relevance to, the event.

# ATTACHMENT IV.

## Perceived Gaps in CIA Records

*Summary.* This Attachment addresses the Board's requested explanation for the apparent absence of files which are known to have existed (or for which there is some evidence that they existed at one time) but cannot now be located. Specifically, the Board asked for such information on the following: Oswald files; certain files of James Angleton; DCI McCone files; William Pawley; and Win Scott. This Attachment also addresses the Board's request that the Agency's Declaration "...identify any other records relating to Oswald or the assassination that CIA knows to have been destroyed or removed from CIA files."

## Discussion.

## Files on Lee Harvey Oswald

(a) The Office of Security (OS) maintained a pre- assassination subject file on Oswald. This file contained newspaper articles and reports from other government agencies. As would be expected, the number of volumes of the subject file grew following the assassination. The pre- assassination material remained in volume one and subsequent material was filed in volumes numbered II through VI. However, during a February 1997 search, no volume V was found. A second thorough search of the OS file system failed to produce any record of Volume V. A careful page- by-page review of the contents of the existing volumes revealed there is no time gap in the material. Therefore, it is believed the label on Volume VI is simply incorrect; it should have been labeled Volume V.

The OS Oswald subject file was reviewed by the HSCA in 1978; however, it was not stored with the rest of the sequestered material. There is no documentation on why this file was not incorporated into the sequestered collection held by the DO; eight boxes of non-Oswald OS files were in the collection. The Oswald Security File has been reviewed, declassified, and released to NARA.

(b) There has been considerable interest over the years in locating any electronic surveillance tapes that would have been made during the period that Oswald visited Mexico (26 September - 2 October 1963). A thorough search has been conducted of the DO's record system as well as the index to retired records in an attempt to locate any tapes and/or find documentation to resolve their disposition. We have discussed this issue with operational experts and their


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 40

professional opinion is that most likely such tapes were never returned to Headquarters for retention. It was normal practice to recycle audio tapes after they had been listened to by transcribers and their transcripts made.

Messages between field stations and headquarters used operational jargon and shortened sentence structures that can sometimes allow for misinterpretations. Thus, possible confusion was created when references to what was being sent to headquarters referred to "tapes" but really intend "information" from tapes.

In our search efforts we did locate approximately 185 audio surveillance tapes of the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City that were recorded during the immediate time following the assassination (22 November 1963 to January 1964). The fact that these tapes were retained and returned to Headquarters could account for the fact that some people recall that some tapes existed which were sent to Headquarters.

Based upon the search efforts that were undertaken and the opinions of operational experts consulted, CIA has concluded that the tapes in question do not exist and were almost certainly recycled in the normal course of business before their potential value was identified.

James J. Angleton (Chief, CounterIntelligence Staff, 1954-1974)

As noted in a 24 August 1998 memo to the Board, the files of Mr. Angleton were incorporated within the files of the CI Staff and the Directorate of Operations. Three memoranda, dated 23 November 1976, 5 August 1977, and 29 November 1979, detail the review and incorporation into the DO Central Records System of the Angleton files as well as all the files found in CI Staff following Mr. Angleton's departure. As a result of this review and incorporation of files, there is no identifiable collection of Angleton files. The three memoranda mentioned above have been included in the Agency's JFK collection for processing and release to NARA.

John McCone (Director of Central Intelligence, 1961-1965)

Within the McCone papers are several file folders with notations that indicate documents are missing. However, each folder has an index of the documents that were originally within it. Of all the missing documents only two refer to the Kennedy assassination. One document is described as "Date of Meeting - 26 Nov; Participants - DCI &

2


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 41

Bundy; Subjects Covered - Msg concerning Pres. Kennedy's
assassination." The second document is described as "Date
of Meeting - 19 May '64; Participants - DCI, J.J. McCloy;
Dinner at Residence - Re: Oswald. [The latter is annotated:
"Destroyed 1-28-72."]

Both documents were noted as missing when the files
were reviewed by the CIA History Staff in November 1986.

William Pawley (Industrialist; friend of DCI Dulles and
supporter of Anti-Castro activities)

The JFK collection contains a 201 file on Mr. Pawley
that ends in 1962. The Directorate of Operations determined
that material through 1965 that should have been in the 201
file was filed in an operational file. Most of the material
was already within the JFK collection. The Board staff
reviewed all the documents within the operational file and
selected additional documents for inclusion in the JFK
collection. This material will be processed for release to
NARA.

Win Scott (Chief of Station, Mexico City, 1956-1969)

The Agency's Retired Record Table (RRT) shows Mr.
Scott's Mexico City files were retired as Job 78-00594R on
11 August 1972. These records were retired to the Agency's
Archives and Records Center under Item Number 40-76 in the
DO Records Control Schedule in effect at that time. Files
under Item Number 40-76 were described as:

"Temporary. Destroy upon completion of a specific job
or as they serve their purpose. Return folders and
documents on loan and destroy remaining papers."

The RRT shows Job 78-00594R was destroyed on 12 January
1987, based upon reference to Item Number 40-76 of the
Records Control Schedule.

The RRT page showing the disposition of Mr. Scott's
files and the page of the Records Control Schedule which
describes Item Number 40-76 have been incorporated in the
Agency's JFK collection and will be processed for release to
NARA.

Certain Station Files

Within the Board's guidance for CIA's compliance
declaration, the Board asked that the Agency specifically
address the existence, non-existence or destruction of files

3


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

from two stations in its Final Compliance Statement. The two stations in question are Mexico City for the period 1963-1964, and Moscow for the period 1959-1962.

It has been long-standing practice and policy that materials that the DO keeps in the field are for immediate operational needs, and that record materials are to be returned to Headquarters for safekeeping. Limited storage space overseas as well as the risk of physical loss in the event of civil unrest or the need for evacuation are contributing factors to this policy. Once at Headquarters, these materials are normally organized by topic or subject rather than by station because this is the way that work is performed. Particularly with paper records and the passage of significant time, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to reconstruct with any confidence, a full set of documents for any particular station.

We do know that files from Mexico City Station are listed in the documents found in the sequestered collection and the Oswald 201 file materials. This divergence from normal practice with respect to these files can be explained by the obvious high interest of the Warren Commission in the events in Mexico City surrounding the time of the assassination (as shown by the fact that they are contained in the Warren Commission materials). It would not have been normal practice at the time for the Agency to keep these records in this form. Thus, other than the materials in the sequestered collection and the Oswald 201 file, we have been unable to identify collections of records which would represent files for the two stations for the periods requested.

HTLINGUAL

The Church and Pike Committees both expressed concern about HTLINGUAL, a mail opening project which held information on American citizens. As a result of these investigations, CIA was directed by court order to destroy all HTLINGUAL material. It is reasonable to believe that an HTLINGUAL file existed on Lee Harvey Oswald; however, along with all other files designated as HTLINGUAL files, it would have been destroyed in accordance with the court order. Within the JFK sequestered collection, there are HTLINGUAL materials on Oswald -- materials which were apparently copied from the HTLINGUAL files before they were destroyed in accordance with the court order. It is not possible, however, to say that everything on Oswald that was held in the HTLINGUAL file wound up in the JFK collection. (See Tab 2 of Attachment V for more details.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 43

# Records Relating to Oswald or the Assassination known to have been destroyed or removed.

In November 1997, the Information Management Officer of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) advised that he had discovered a record which indicated a file that referred to the Kennedy assassination had been destroyed on "5/1/95". A search for information on this document revealed that the document had been created in 1977 and was described as "allegations regarding the Lee Harvey Oswald file." It was included with other documents grouped under the description:

"Individual Case Files - Consists of documents accumulated in investigating complaints, suggestions, or problems of individuals which are brought to the attention of the IG. Filed numerically by case number. Potential cases filed alphabetically."

It has been confirmed that copies of the documents were made available to the HSCA and are in the sequestered collection. The OIG has reconstructed the file and will maintain it as a permanent record. Documentation is provided at Tab 1.

## Specific Requests From the Board

*Summary*. The JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 mandates a number of specific actions on behalf of all government departments and agencies. One of these is to:

> "...make available to the Review Board any additional information and records that the Review Board has reason to believe it requires for conducting a review under this Act." (Sec. 5(c)2 H.)

In the exercise of this authority under the Act, the Board made fifty-three specific requests for additional records and information in the form of sixteen (16) requests designated as "formal" and thirty-seven (37) designated as "informal." On each request, the CIA worked closely with the Board and Board staff to provide the information and/or documents requested and a written response which records such actions.

*Discussion*. As a part of this Final Declaration, the CIA has attached at Tab 1 a list of the fifty-three requests by number and a short description of the subject of each. At the Board's request this attachment includes at Tab 2 the specific response to the request numbered CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination File)

Beyond the fifty-three requests, the Board raised two additional matters which tend to fall within the category of special requests:

1) A request that the Agency review and declassify the Board's interviews of former CIA officer and Mexico City station employee, Anne Goodpasture; the Agency's response to that request is complete.

2) A request for Board staff access to sealed Rockefeller Commission records held by the Library of Congress; these records were given to the Library by Rockefeller via a deed of gift which requires a letter from the DCI before access can be granted. This letter will be completed by 9 September 1998.

24 December 1997

Dr. T. Jeremy Gunn
Executive Director
Assassination Records Review Board
600 E. Street, N.W. (2nd Floor)
Washington, D.C. 20530

Dear Dr. Gunn:

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records
No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files) and
No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)

This is a partial response to the ARRB's referent request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is believed the following comments and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of Security questions. The DO response is pending.

1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum containing information from the Agency's Office of Personnel Security which provides details about the files it had on Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they were created. These include the Office of Security file on Oswald, a general file on Americans who had defected to another country and information about HTLINGUAL files.

2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977 memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which explains the numbering of that Office's file on Oswald. In particular, it explains why the "missing" volume V may never have existed..

3. An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald Security file and the file on American defectors.

4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRB staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will be processed according to current release guidelines.

If you have any questions about this response, please advise.

Sincerely,

![Signature of J. Barry Harrelson]

# MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

22 December 1997

1.  Pursuant to ARRB "Resquet No. CIA-16, the Office of Personnel Security conducted research for and existing pre- assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The following responses are provided to those questions which pertain to the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are the best reasonable answers based on available information. Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to 1 October 1994.

Question 1: Please identify, as specifically as possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: At the time of the assassination, the Office of Security (OS) held two files which contained information on Lee Harvey Oswald. One file entitled "Defectors File" (#0341008), contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, and the second file was Office of Security subject file on Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in the automated security database known as the Management Data Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated system. This hand search produced the same results as the automated search of MDP/PS.

2.  Within the ARRB request is specific mention of an HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file), #0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along with numerous soft files. Since this material has been destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. The search of Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any of these files. Attached is all of the available information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL files. This information was retrieved from the Information Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review of general office administrative files.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 58

# Question 2: For other than the 201-289248 file on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and the documents that were in the file at the time of the assassination.

Response: As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

3. HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project involving the opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South America. In the Office of Security this project was known as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER. The Office of Security actually conducted the opening and monitoring of mail with the acquired information being referred to the Directorate of Operations.

4. The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa 1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens defecting to other countries and information regarding foreign nationals considering defection to the United States. This file contained information was from press clippings, Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed services. The pre-assassination documents located in this file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959 entitled "U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at 15"

b. Department of State memorandum dated 25 October 1960 with attached list of American "defectors" from May 1959 to October 1960

c. Memorandum for Chief/Security Research Staff dated 31 October 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject: American Defectors


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 59

d. Memorandum for Deputy Director of Security dated
1 November 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject:
American Defectors

e. Handwritten chart of defectors dated 26 August
1961

f. Defector outline prepared in October 1961 listing
known defectors to the USSR, Red China, Cuba, and
United Arab Republic.

5. The index reference to the Defectors File
   identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as
   the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer
   printout of defectors and provided limited biographic data
   on each name. This listing was maintained separately from
   the actual Defectors File; notations within the Defectors
   File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently
   charged to the Security Analysis Group of the Office of
   Security. Efforts to locate this listing or determine its
   disposition have been unsuccessful.

6. Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors
   File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings.
   An employee of this Office was, recalls the Defector Machine
   Listing as being approximately one and one-half inches thick
   and in two parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical
   index of defector names with assigned numbers. The second
   part listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and
   contained the limited biographic data on each name.

7. The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald
   (#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file
   was created as a separate repository for the numerous press
   clippings and reports received from other government
   agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR
   and his activities following his return to the United
   States. The first volume of this file appears to have been
   preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents
   contained in this file are as follows:

a. Department of State telegram #1304 from Moscow
dated 31 October 1959

b. The Washington Post press clipping dated
1 November 1959 entitled "Ex-Marine Asks Soviet
Citizenship"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 60

c. Department of State Dispatch #234 from Moscow dated 2 November 1959

d. Department of State telegram #1448 from Tokyo dated 9 November 1959

e. Department of State telegram #1358 from Moscow dated 9 November 1959

f. The Washington Post press clipping dated 16 November 1959 entitled "Rebuffed"

g. Evening Star press clipping dated 26 November 1959 entitled "U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at 15"

h. Report Summary prepared by Soviet Russia Division forwarded to Office of Security in March 1960

i. Department of State Instruction A-273 dated 13 April 1961

j. Department of State Dispatch from Moscow dated May 1961 with enclosure of Oswald letter

k. Federal Bureau of Investigation report dated 3 July 1961 from Dallas, Texas

l. Note to CI/SI dated 28 September 1961

m. Form 745 "Indices Search Request" dated 12 October 1961

n. Department of State Dispatch #317 from Moscow dated 12 October 1961 with enclosure

o. Form G-135a Immigration and Naturalization Service name check form to Central Intelligence Agency dated 5 December 1961

p. Navy Department message to Moscow dated 3 March 1962

q. Department of the Navy memorandum to the Federal Bureau of Investigation dated 26 April 1962 with enclosure

r. The Washington Post press clipping dated 9 June 1962 entitled "Third American in 2 Months


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 61

Leaves Soviet 'Home'"

s. Federal Bureau of Investigation transmittal
of report from Dallas, Texas, dated 30 August
1962.

8. In addition to those documents listed above, the
   following documents were located in a subsequent volume of
   the Oswald file and also appear to predate the assassination
   of President Kennedy.

t. Undated summary of file information on Lee
Harvey Oswald

u. Incoming cable #83858 from Mexico City dated
20 July 1963 (no mention of Oswald)

v. Incoming cable #01325 from Mexico City dated
17 August 1963 (no mention of Oswald)

w. Incoming cable #36017 from Mexico City dated
9 October 1963

x. Outgoing cable #74830 to Mexico City dated
10 October 1963

y. Incoming cable #47041 from Mexico City dated
24 October 1963 (no mention of Oswald).

Question 4: To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.

Response: It is believed that OS holdings on Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.
Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of

5


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 62

documents increased, a separate file was created to be the repository of information on the alleged American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors File that a separate file exists on Oswald.

9. Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D. Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre- assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a majority of them contain a notation or the initials of Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing of this information.

10. The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the component responsible for collecting, developing, and evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency's organization, employees, and activities by foreign or domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted research in connection with employee loyalty cases and maintained records identifying personalities, environments, and personal traits of individuals who had been of counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained liaison with various government agencies in connection with counterintelligence activities and coordinated the counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported directly to the office of the Director of Security.

11. A representataive of the Office of Personnel Security /Management Staff was queried regarding the mission and functions of SRS during the pre-assassination time period. He made inquiries relating to the above request, and the OPS/Information Management Officer retrieved retired policy records for review. The information on the mission and function of SRS was retrieved from the archived Office of Security administrative and historical files as well as a review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

27 October 1997

FROM: Janet A. Ecklund
Chief, Information Management Branch
Office of Personnel Security

SUBJECT: OSWALD, LEE HARVEY
ΑΙΝ: 0351164

1. The Office of Personnel Security was tasked on 31 January 1997 by the Historical Review Group/Center for the Study of Intelligence (HRG/CSI), via the Directorate of Administration/Information Review Office, with researching pre- assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald. The tasking was generated by the John F. Kennedy Board's desire to review and declassify relevant material. The results of this review were forwarded to the HRG/CSI on 27 February 1997.

2. During the Information Management Branch's (IMB)research in response to the above tasking it was noted that Volume V of the Oswald files was not on the shelf where Volumes I-IV and VI-VII were located. A search of the entire area where the volumes had been maintained failed to locate Volume V. The IMB Files Section was subsequently charged with conducting an all out search for the missing volume. The search failed to find Volume V.

3. In July 1997, the Oswald files were reviewed page by page prior to being turned over to HRG/CSI and another attempt was made to locate Volume V or to locate persons who might know what happened to it. Volume V was not located nor were any persons located who were knowledgeable of its status.

4. During the complete review of the Oswald files no time gap was apparent and no one was located who could recall ever seeing Volume V. This would suggest that either Volume V had been consolidated into other volumes or that Volume V never existed, but that a numbering error resulted in what should have been Volume V being labeled as Volume VI. The use of Roman numerals on the cover of the volumes might have caused this error to occur.

# DO Response to Board Request CIA - 16
## Oswald Pre-Assassination Files

The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO records to determine if there were any additional files containing pre-assassination records relating to Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald 201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The document identified CI Staff as the file custodian. CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were incorporated into the 201.

Prior to establishing a 201, any documents received would have been placed in an operational interest file. We found no reference to the existence of an operational file. If such a file had existed, however, it might not have been registered in the central index. It was standard procedures that upon opening a 201, the documents from an interest file would be transferred to the 201.

Given that Oswald was a subject of the HTLINGUAL operation, it is reasonable to believe that there was a file on him. We destroyed all of the HTLINGUAL files under court order, and no record was made of what files existed. We did not review all of the DO record system to destroy all copies of material which may have been derived from HTLINGUAL material. We know, for instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items related to Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection

In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the information we are aware of that we had prior to the assassination.

# Attachment VI

## Disposition of CIA/HSCA Sequestered Collection and other Assassination Records.

*Summary*. This attachment discusses proposed agreements and understandings between the CIA, the Review Board and National Archives and Records Administration regarding the disposition of JFK Assassination-related records held by CIA which are not already at the National Archives, and the terms under which those records to be declassified will be dealt with.

## Discussion.

1. "Processing of CIA Assassination Records by September 1998". Per agreement with the Review Board, the declassification review of all records, unless specifically designated for post-September 1998 processing by the Review Board, in the following categories will be completed and the releasable version of the records ready for transfer to the National Archives by September 30, 1998:

*   Non-duplicate documents from the CIA-HSCA sequestered collection, the Russ Holmes files and the LA Division working files;

*   Documents designated as assassination records as a result of Review Board specific requests for additional information and records (CIA 1-16, CIA-IR 1-37);

*   All documents from Lee Harvey Oswald's "A" file and post-1978 201 file; Oswald's 201 file and security file and Marina Oswald's 201 (microfilm version) have already been transferred to NARA;

*   Any non-duplicate documents discovered in the recent searches undertaken to ensure full compliance with the JFK Act; any new documents on Oswald will be added to the post-1978 part of his 201 file.

2. "Processing of Duplicate Documents and Commitments for the Future Treatment of Assassination Records".

*   CIA/HSCA sequestered collection duplicates to be completed and transferred to NARA by September 1999.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 67

*   Russ Holmes Working Files to be completed and a declassified version transferred to NARA by December 1998.

*   Mexico City tapes (186) to be completed and transferred to NARA by September 1999. [CIA-IR-15]

*   Post-September 1998 Discovery of Assassination Records.

    Diligent searches have been made and we are aware of no assassination records being withheld from the Board. However, given the Agency's decentralized records systems, it is possible that assassination-related documents will be discovered in the future. A guide has been prepared for those officers whose work requires them to review Agency documents and material (Executive Order Review, FOIA, etc.) that may be subject to the JFK Act. Any assassination records that are discovered will be processed according to JFK release standards and forwarded to NARA. A copy of the guide is attached. (TAB 1)

*   Referrals not complete by 30 September 1998. The CIA proposes that it complete its review and return to originating agency by April 1999 all unreviewed third agency referral documents which were received prior to 30 September 1998. To date the following referral have been identified for possible post-September 1998 review:

    a. Army's Investigative Records Repository (from Review Board):

    File on Alfredo Mirabal Diaz                                  --   151 pages

    b. SSCI -- Church Committee Records                            --   TBD pages

    (to be identified by Review Board staff)

    c. JFK Presidential Library:

    Records from Robert Kennedy files                                 --   1484 pages

    These documents have not been formally designated as Assassination Records. The CIA proposes that these be handled in a manner similar to the John F. Kennedy National Security Files on Cuba that were reviewed in 1996 by a joint CIA-State-DOD-Review Board task force.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 68

3. "Custody of CIA Assassination Records to be Released in 2017."

The CIA proposes that the classified versions of Lee Harvey Oswald's Security File and "A" File along with Marina Oswald's original 201 be transferred to the protected (secure) portion of the JFK Collection At NARA by 30 September 1998. The CIA will need to retain custody of the classified version of the original Oswald 201 and the CIA-HSCA sequestered collection to complete the review of duplicate documents by September 1999.

In September 1999, the classified versions of the Oswald 201 (original and microfilm from the sequestered collection) will be transferred to NARA. Due to the sensitive nature of the information in the remaining sequestered collection, particularly the NBR material, CIA proposes that the Agency and National Archives work out a joint custody arrangement that would allow these record to remain in CIA physical custody until 2017.

Executive Order

8 October 1997

JFK Records Review Project

(U) The following is intended as a guide for those people whose work requires them to review Agency documents and materials that may be subject to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. Some of the records within the Agency's JFK collection are assassination specific, others are ancillary. They deal with individuals and events not directly linked with Oswald or the assassination; but they are thought to have had a relationship to the assassination, or investigation into the assassination.

I. The Agency's JFK Collection.

(U) The Agency's JFK records collection is made up primarily of records pulled together for the Warren Commission and House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). There were eighty-one (81) Records Center-sized boxes in the original collection. Of these, the first seventeen (17) made up the Oswald 201 file. The next sixty- four (64) are referred to as the "JFK files" or sequestered collection and break down as follows: thirty-four (34) boxes of DO materials; nine (9) boxes of Office of Security files; fifteen (15) boxes of OLC materials; two (2) boxes each of OGC and IG materials; and one (1) box of DDS&T documents. HSCA originated material, including notes by HSCA staff members, are found throughout the collection. Box 64 contains seventy two (72) reels of microfilm.

(U) The microfilm contains copies of complete files to which the HSCA had access during its investigation. In addition to the Oswald 201 file (12 reels), the microfilm includes: 201 files on Cubans, Americans, and Soviets linked to Oswald, the JFK assassination or the various investigations (approximately 26 reels) and the Cuban Revolutionary Council and other exile group activities (approximately 13 reels); the personnel files of CIA staff employees (approximately 5 reels); and operational files on organizations, projects, and other subjects of interest to the HSCA investigation (approximately 16 reels).

(U) We continue to identify other collections of documents that properly belong within the JFK collection. These include: The Oswald Security File; Agency working files generated by JFK assassination investigations and requests; and CIA documents found by other agencies and Presidential Libraries and referred to CIA for review under the JFK Act.

## II. The Time Frame of JFK Assassination Records.

(U) In general, the time frame of JFK records commences when Oswald arrived at the US air base (the U-2) at Atsugi, Japan, in December 1957 and continues through the end of the Garrison investigation in 1968. Note, however, for information which is clearly related to the story of the JFK assassination or its investigations, there is no time frame limitation. Any document or request that deals with the assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, or the various conspiracy theories should be referred to the HRG/JFK review project.

## III. Key Topics, Etc.

(U) Certain individuals, organizations, places, projects, and subjects are central to the Oswald/JFK story and the ensuing investigations, which causes a number of documents with no mention of Oswald or the assassination to fall within the purview of the JFK Act. Clearly, it is not possible to list every category of document which may have been reviewed and released under the JFK Assassination Records Act. The following categories contain examples of information that are considered to be within the JFK review.

(U) A. JFK Assassination Investigations:

  * Warren Commission, 1963-64
  * James Garrison, New Orleans DA, 1966-68
  * Rockefeller Commission, 1975;
  * Church Committee (Senate), 1975-76
  * House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), 1976-79
  * JFK Assassination, anti-Castro plots and CIA anti-Cuban operations only.

B. Key subjects

(S) * Moscow Station, Mexico City Station, JMWAVE Station, and CIA stations in those cities through which Oswald passed on his way to and from the Soviet Union, as they related to Oswald's activities or to possible conspiracies.

-SECRET-

(AIUO) -- CIA anti-Cuban operations 1960-64 (Mongoose, etc.) if they involve JFK figures (see comment on Meagher's "index" below); most US anti-Castro activities in 1963 are considered relevant.

(U) -- Cuban exile anti-Castro activities, leaders and organizations, 1960-64, if they involve JFK figures.

SUBJECT: Re: blurb from JFK Board

After reading the note below, I spoke with the GC, who working with Bob Caudle, was seeking to have included in the Board statement the fact that the DCI had sent a letter endorsing my declaration. I suggested to the GC that even with this addition, the JFK Board comment would be most unfortunate. The whole six year effort was designed to put to rest all of the conspiracy theories and this comment would undercut the effort. In addition, it likely would result in significant additional questions, additional work for OIM, OCA, OGC and PAS, and put the Agency in a bad light. I suggested that I should ask the EXDIR to sign the declaration. The GC interposed no objection. I then spoke with the EXDIR who agreed to sign a declaration if this would satisfy the situation. I informed the GC that the EXDIR was willing to sign and the GC asked me to inform Bob Caudle, which I did. After you spoke with Judge Tunheim and got his agreement to: 1) return the Cohen declaration and the DCI letter and substitute the EXDIR declaration, and 2) eliminate the "blurb," I had the EXDIR sign the declaration.

I subsequently briefed the DDA, ADDA, and ADDA/IS. of the above.

under penalty of perjury, that they had conducted thorough searches and identified all relevant records. The CIA refused. The Board then, as an alternative, asked the highest officials of the Agency - - the Executive Director and General Counsel - - to certify that CIA had met its obligations under the JFK Act and that no records on Oswald or assassination were withheld. The CIA refused. Instead, the CIA designated its Director of Information Management to sign CIA's Declaration of Compliance. In the Board's view, CIA's highest officials should have been willing to certify, under oath, that the Agency has complied with all the requirements of the JFK Act. The CIA's failure to do so raises serious concerns for the Board that the CIA has in fact fully complied with the JFK Act."

1. Barbara Blufer, declare and state based on my personal knowledge and the Information made available to me in my official capacity that:

1. I am the Information Review Officer for (IRO) for the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) of the Central Intelligence Agency (Agency). I was appointed to this position on 6 October 1997 and have held various administrative and professional positions within the Agency since (1980). I em responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the DI that may contain JFK Assassination records and may be responsive to Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) requests.

2. Since assuming my present position, I have had limited contact with the ARRB. With respect to matters prior to 6 October 1997, this statement has been prepared with Inputs from my predecessor, Richard J. Flynn, who occupled my current position during the Di's principal contact with the Board.

3. Mr. Flynn has reported that, to ensure that the ARRB staff understood the DI records system and search capabilities, the DMRO and the DI Information Management Officer, Ms. Diana Hastings, briefed the staff on 13 May 1997. Other DI participants at the meeting were Joyce Jump, Marie Menefee, and Ilse Harlman. These officers were at that time assigned to the DI Office of Information Resources. Ms. Hastings focused on the current Di records keeping system, and, as best we could, the system that existed in the 1980s. Di participants stressed that the Di'records keeping system has evolved over time and that the DI Is continuously striving to achieve greater consistency in our procedures. DI participants candidly informed the 'ARRB staff that none of them at the meeting had first hand knowledge of DI records keeping in the 1980s, and b) the system in place at that time was entirely paper-based and therefore could not ba considered as accurate as the present system. Members of the ARRB sald they understood this limitation

4. Mr. Flynn further reported that based on his recollection, Mr. Flynn is aware of a Ilmited number of records searches the DI conducted in direct response to ARRB requests On 11 June 1997, Di personnel met with members of the ARRB. Mr. Flynn had arranged this? meeting earlier to give ARRB staffers, Michelle Combs and Bob Skwrlot, an even more det detalled briefing of Di's document search capabilities. The topics they asked the DI to search are noted in an attached memorandum to Barry Harrelson dated 17 June 1997.. The result of further searches (CIA-9) are summarized a 19 June 1997 memorandum a member of the DI/IRO's staff prepared for. Mr. Barry Harrelson, CIA's point of contact on the JFK assassination lasue. This memorandum is also attached.

5. On 21 August, Mr. Harrelson contacted me for a further search of Di records, asking specifically that the Di follow up on a previously search by extending the timeframe covered in that original search. According to Mr. Harrelson, the ARRB requested a search for all documents conceming Mexico, Cuba, or the USSR for the period from 20 November 1983 to 6 Decembar 1963. On the basis of this request, a search was conducted 32 documents not belonging to the Di were located. The materials were tumed over to Mr. Harrelson.

6. All employees of the Directorate of Intelligence have been furnished with a copy of DCI Tenet's 22 July 1998 directive to all employees requiring them to search records in their possession for Information related to the JFK assassination that might not have been found in the course of the searches conducted over the past 6 years.

7. I declare under penalty of perjury that foregoing is true and correct.

# DECLARATION OF MARY LOU CUMMINGS

I, MARY LOU CUMMINGS, hereby declare and say as follows:

1. I am the Information Review Officer ("IRO") for the offices of the Director of Central Intelligence (CIA). I was appointed to this position on 5 January 1998, and have held various administrative and professional positions within the Agency since 1981. I am responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the DCI area (Offices of the Director and Deputy Director(DCI&DDCI), Community Management Staff (CMS), National Intelligence Council (NIC), Office of the Comptroller (COMPT), Office of the General. Counsel (OGC), Office of Congressional Affairs(OCA), Office of the Inspector General (OIG), Office of Public Affairs (OPA), Arms Control Intelligence Staff (ACIS), and Center for the Study of Intelligence (CSI)) that may contain JFK Assassination records and may be responsive to ARRB requests.

2. By memo date 6 April 1995, the Executive Director (CIA) requested that focal points for each Directorate be appointed to be responsible for responding to requests for information from the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB): Until that time the Historical Review Group (HRG) of the Center for the Studies of Intelligence (CSI) had been the principal liaison with the JFK Board. As of that date, DCI area/IRO was appointed to be the DCI area focal point. HRG would continue to receive requests from the Board forwarding them to the Directorate focal point for action. Responses from the Directorate were coordinated by HRG, which then made the responses available to the Board.

3. In an effort to understand the DCI area records systems and to ensure the conduct of thorough searches and responses, the ARRB staff requested a meeting with the DCI area/IRO and key DCI records management officers. Detailed questions were presented in advance to CIA personnel who then provided complete responses to the ARRB staff during the summer of 1997. At that time HRG instructed my predecessor to wait for formal taskings from ARRB before proceeding with additional searches.

See Attachment 1

4. Based on personal knowledge and information reflected in the records of the DCI area/IRO, I am aware that the following searches and reviews were conducted in response to Board requests for DCI area records.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 81

Following the Board's request of 1 March 1996, the records systems of CMS were searched for JFK assassination related information with negative results. The Board then asked to examine CMS shelf listings for the relevant time period. A redacted copy of the shelf list was delivered to HRG in April 1998. On 12 August the Board identified 14 CMS records that they believe may be relevant. On 21 August, ARRB Staff examined the responsive folders.

See Attachment 4

# DECLARATION OF BECKY L. RANI

I, Becky L. Rant, declare and say as follows:

1. I am the Information Review Officer (IRO) for the Directorate of Administration (DA) of the Central Intelligence Agency (Agency). I was appointed to this position on 3 February 1997. and have held various administrative and professional positions within the Agency since 1965. I am responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the DA. Office of the Deputy Director of Administration (ODDA), Center for CIA Security (CCS-formerly the Office of Security ((OS)), Office of Human Resource Management (HRM), Office of Medical Services (OMS), Office of Finance and Logistics (OFL), Office of Communications (OC), Office of Training and Education (OTE), Office of Facilities and Security Services (OFSS), Agency Technology Services (ATS), Center for Security Evaluation (CSE), that may contain JFK Assassination records and may be responsive to Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) requests.

2. To ensure that the ARRB staff understood the DA records systems and search capabilities, the DA/IRO and DA Information Management Officer (DA/IMO) briefed the staff on 17 March 1997. The briefing focused on the DA records systems that existed in the 1960s and the current records systems. Questions that were provided by the staff prior to the briefing were discussed and an individual from the Office of Communications (OC) attended to answer questions related to cable processing in the 1960s. In addition to OC participation, the Offices of Finance & Logistics (OFL), Human Resource Management (HRM), and Security (OS) provided written responses to the list of questions submitted by the staff. It was agreed that the additional questions raised by the staff during the briefing would be tasked to the directorate formally by the Agency JFK Focal Point/Historical Review Program (HRP). An outline of the records briefing and a copy of the advance questions and the answers provided appear as Attachment 1.

3. Based on personal knowledge and on information reflected in the records of the DA/IRO, I am aware of the following searches that were conducted in response to specific AARB requests for DA records:

CIA 1 - Information on Organization of CIA

The DA provided from the records of the Regulatory Services Group/ODDA copies of Agency regulations and notices pertaining to the organizational structure of the Agency during the time periods specified by the ARRB staff. DA/IRO gave approval for the cleared staff members to review the material. Subsequently the DA/IRO approved release of the following items:

31 mission statements and organization charts for the DDA (DDS) and Office of Security (full release)

2 organization charts and mission statement of the Office of Communications (OC) (sanitized)

16 Agency mission, function and organization charts (full release with concurrence of the other directorates) (Attachment 2)

CIA-7-Histories

The DA JFK Focal Point reviewed the index of histories produced by the CIA History Program for release to the ARRB and approved access with certain restrictions. There is no record in the DA/IRO's office that the staff requested access to the DA histories on the list. (Attachment 3)

## CIA-12-JMWAVE-5 Files

The DA conducted file searches in OS and HRM for records on Theodore Shackley, Ronald Cross, Bart Henry, Doug Gupton, David Morales. We were subsequently advised by HRP that the David Morales OS file was part of the collection so the OS searched for records on the first four names only. OS identified files on Shackley, Cross and Gupton which were reviewed by the ARRB staff. HRM identified files on Morales and Shackley which were provided to HRP. Neither office surfaced records on Bart Henry. (Attachment 4)

## CIA-16-Oswald Pre-assassination Files

The Office of Security identified a multi-volume file and provided answers to questions posed by the ARRB staff. (Attachment 5). The OS file was reviewed and in April 1998 was released to the National Archives. NOTE: The attached 17 February 1997 OS memorandum describes records holding related to HTLINGUAL and states that the files were destroyed in April 1994.

## CIA-IR-03 HTLINGUAL File

See CIA-16 above and Attachment 5

## CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart

Capehart's Office of Security file is in the sequestered collection. The DA JFK Focal Point provided input on the question of protecting Capehart's relationship with global marine. (Attachment 6). In coordination with the DS&T, HRP responded to the ARRB staff.

## CIA-09 George Bush Computer Search

The Offices of Security and Human Resource Management reviewed the files of George Herbert Walker Bush and found no documentation indicating that Mr. Bush had an affiliation with CIA during the 1963 time period. Attachment 7

## CIA-IR-11 Warren Commission Critics

The Offices of Security, Human Resource Management and Information Management were tasked with records searches on Edward Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Harold Weisberg and Sylvia Meagher. No records were found on Lane and Thompson. Weisburg and Epstein security files were made available for ARRB staff review. An OS impersonal file was identified but had been destroyed in 1994. HRM found only an OSS service card on Weisberg which has been supplied to HRP. OIM identified a file on Epstein. Several FOIA and PA files also were identified. Attachment 8. Contains the DA response and the final HRP response letter coordinated with the DA/IRO.

## CIA-IR-13 - Office/Person Dealing with Organized Crime & Cuba

Types of Questions for DA Records Briefing
March 17, 1997

## Budget and Finance

1. In *Cold Warrior*, (p. 52) Mangold refers to a CI secret slush fund which was tightly controlled by Angleton and never audited by the usual procedures. According to Mangold, it was this fund which allowed Angleton to run his own operations without supervision. Did the fund exist? Was this fund ever audited? Are there any, records of CI operational expenses for the period 1959-63?..

2. Mangold also refers (p. 53) to an unnamed CI/B&F officer who says he worked for Angleton from 1958-1964 and never dealt with him directly on a single matter. Is there a list of B&F officers assigned to the CI Staff from 1959-63. Do their records still exist?

3. We have seen Directorate of Operations monthly operational reports which contain information on the allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DO or DA records which reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this type of information from the early 1960's still be retrieved?

4. What records are kept on disbursements to sources in the field? If, hypothetically, LHO had received money from the Agency, what records would exist?

## Personnel

1. What records are maintained on contract personnel?

## Security

1. For the period between 1955-65, what was the universe of files that OS had on individuals or groups?

2. How are Office of Security records indexed?

3. What was the function of the Office of Security/Security Research Staff (OS/SRS)? Why were defector records kept in this component?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 103

DRAFT

4. In the OS/SRS:memo of Oct. 31, 1960; written by Marguerite D. Stevens, the file numbers of several defectors are listed: "Robert Edward Webster, EE-18854; Lee Harvey Oswald, MS-11165; Libero Ricciardelli, MS-8295; Vladimir Sloboda, MS-10565; and Joseph Dutkanicz, MS-10724." What do the "MS" and "EE" file prefixes.designate? How are these designations assigned?

5. Does OS process security clearances for non-employees (e.g. sources) to receive access to classified information? What kinds of files are created by this process? How long are these file's maintained. For example, Clay Shaw was given a security clearance and had access to classified information based on his "responsibilities" as a source for the Domestic Contacts Division (DCD).

6. Where are records that would describe liaison (etc.) cooperation or operations between OS and CI located? How are these records organized?

7. Where are records regarding operations that OS participated in or ran located. For example, where are the OS records on the Castro assassination attempts?

8. How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which OS components maintained files on Oswald? Why did OS have any files on Oswald?

---

Do we have anyone who can brief on cable process in 60-64 time period. How come in, decrypted. what happened from the time a cable was sent from a field site until it arrived on a desk at Ngs, how disseminated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 104

# CONFIDENTIAL

## Budget and Finance

Question 1 - In Cold Warrior Mangold refers to a CIA secret slush fund which was tightly controlled by Angleton and not audited by usual procedures. Did the fund exist? Was the fund audited? Are there any records of CI operational expenses for the period 1959-63?

According to C/Financial Service Division (FSD/OFL) who contacted a former finance officer who was a secretary in CI in 1957-60, to the best of their recollection CI did not have their own finance officer. C/FSD also talked to another officer during that era who did not recall that CI was one of the early offices to do their own certification of expenses. It was his feeling that there very well may have been a CI fund that was not handled in the usual way however it is very unlikely to impossible that any fund was not audited/certified in some fashion (i.e. reviewed and certified decentrally and only reported on the books in some aggregate amount). He commented that he has never in discussion with finance officers heard of an account managed by staff officers that wasn't certified by someone in finance.

Question 2 - Mangold also refers to unnamed CI/B&F officer who says he worked for Angleton from 1958-64 and never dealt with him directly on a single matter. Is there a list of B&F officers assigned to the CI staff from 1959-63? Do their records still exist?

OFL - The Career Management Officer stated that we would need the name of the B&F officer in order to identify if he/she was assigned to the CI/Staff. CMO also stated that he does have some old records during that time period pertaining to assignments but the list he has is alphabetical by name. The current procedure is that the soft file maintained in OFL contains the assignment of each officer in the biographical profile.

HRM - Has microfilm staffing complements for the 1959-63 timeframe. These staffing complements were created on a quarterly basis and are broken down by the office (location) level. With the correct directorate/office name we can visually search these microfilm records, find the correct office and produce hardcopy reports listing the employees on the rolls for a given quarter. The hardcopy report could be reviewed to break down the office listing by occupation and create a list of names associated with the occupation (i.e. B&F officers assigned to CI from 1959-63. The employee name could then be used to located current or archived HRM files. CAUTION: 1) If an individual came


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

and left an office during the same quarter they might not appear on the staffing complement, 2, If an individual was TDY to an office they would not appear on the staffing complement of that office. 3) If an individual was being paid by their home office they would not appear on the staffing complement of the outside office they were supporting.

Question 3 - We have seen DO monthly operational reports which contain information on the allocation/distribution of operational funds. Are there other DO or DA records which reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this type of information from the early 1960s still be retrieved?

The DO operational fund records would contain expenditures against a certain project or operation. However, according to C/FSD the system that preceded the General Accounting System (GAS) was RCA 501 (not sure what this contained) but in all probability has been destroyed, would have this type of information also. More information may have been recorded in 201 files similar to today's automated systems.

Question 4 - What records are kept on disbursements in the field? If hypothetically LHO had received money from the Agency what records would exist?

According to the OFL Records Control Schedule station accounting containing indigenous personnel are kept for 56 years, station accounting not containing indigenous personnel are kept 20 years.

Personnel

Question 1 - What records are maintained on contract personnel?

Responsibility for records maintained on independent contract personnel was transferred to OFL o/a 1 October 1996. Staff contract personnel files continue to be maintained by HRM.

Office Contract Personnel Files contain many of the same items found in the staff Official Personnel File (OPF)-- application info, actions (Staff contracts only) clearance info, secrecy agreement, etc., and also contract info (agreements, amendments, terminations, etc.) A separate payroll file was also maintained.

IC'S - fee for task
Staff Contracts - hired for job--not to exceed 5 years.

Contract files can be opened/maintained/retired in true name, pseudo, alias or crypt depending upon the sensitivity of the contract.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

# Security

Question 1 - For the period between 1955-65, what was the universe of files that OS had on individuals or groups?

OPS located information which describes the categories..of.... files created during this time frame but it is impossible to state this is all inclusive:

General - Usually unsolicited correspondence of crank variety and junk.

Security Research Staff - possibly material of counterintelligence interest.

DCD contacts - persons who travel abroad and/or have specific information.

Contractor Employees - industrial contractors with collateral and/or SCI accesses

Miscellaneous - Includes publications, organizations, intelligence services, etc.

Alien - Foreign nationals who were of interest

New Building - Persons involved with construction of original Headquarters Building

Regular - Files which included staff employees, contractors, GSA/GSI, etc.

Question 2 - How are Office of Security records indexed?

Prior to 1964 all index records were maintained on 3x5 inch index cards. When the information was known, these cards included names (primary, alias, telecodes), file numbers, kin/relatives, location/residence, DPOB, citizenship, occupation, polygraph number, reference source data, information codes, remarks, SSN, sex, employer, and file retirement data. To locate a file record, the subject of interest was searched in this card system.

During mid-1964 these index cards with the exception of impersonal entities, were under conversion to a keypunch system. The impersonals (companies, publications, intelligence services, organizations, etc.) were maintained on cards until much later, possibly mid-1970s. Aside form the subject name indices, the Office of Security also indexed information of interest within a file record. This information could include associates, companies, publications, other government agency reports 'information, etc.

TODAY'S INDEXING PARAMETERS ARE VERY LIMITED.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 107

# Question 3 - What was the function of the Office of Security/Security Research Staff (OS/SRS)? Why were defector records kept in this component?

The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the component responsible for collecting, developing, and evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency's organization, employees, and activities by foreign or domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted research in connection with employee loyalty cases and maintained records identifying personalities, environments, and personal traits of individuals who had been of counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained liaison with various government agencies in connection with counterintelligence activities and coordinated the counter intelligence effort throughout OS. SRS reported directly to the Director of Security.

# Question 4 - In the OS/SRS memo of Oct 31, 1960 written by Marguerite D. Stevens, the file numbers of several defectors are listed. What do the MS and EE file prefixed designate? How are these designations assigned.

As noted in question 1, records were categorized according to the type and the older file numbers reflected the file category. "M" designated a miscellaneous record; "S" designated a Security Research Staff record. Therefore "MS" most likely referred to a miscellaneous record of interest to the Security Research Staff. "E" or "EE" designations covered subjects of interest to the Domestic Contacts Division for information/intelligence purposes. It appears that at least some of these alpha designations were converted to numerical values circa 1964.

# Question 5 - Does OS process security clearances for non-employees (e.g. sources) to receive access to classified information? What kind of files are created by this process? How long are these files maintained.

Security clearances per se are not processed for non-employees (sources/contacts). The Office of Security conducts appropriate national agency checks to try to determine the reliability of those individuals who are of interest for contact purposes because of their foreign travels, specific scientific information, etc. In a few instances an ad hoc clearance/validation may be requested in the event some classified information would be revealed in the course of acquiring intelligence from these sources. The validation period is normally five years, and any files created are maintained in the individual's name for a period of ten years after the validation period has expired. The DO would most likely have further information on a particular source.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 108

Question 6 - Where are records that would describe liaison (etc) cooperation or operations between OS and CI located? How are these records organized?

With the short turnaround time imposed on responding to this request no information could be readily located to provide an answer to this question. It is believed that if information of this nature döes exist, it may be located in archived policy or administrative files of the Office of Security and/or Security Research Staff. Retrieval and review of this information would require an extensive research effort. Officers who may possess knowledge of this type of record were queried and it was suggested that info responsive to this question may possibly be located in DO records.

Question 7 - Where are records regarding operations that OS participated in or ran located? For example, where are the OS records on the Castro assassination attempts?

Records on operations and/or projects in which the Office of Security was involved in the past have most likely been destroyed, unless they are maintained because of congressional directives or the records control schedules. The Office of Personnel Security has the capability of retrieving a listing of any current records with the prefix or "project" or "operation". If the title does not include these words, retrieveal would be more difficult unless an exact name or acronym is known for a particular operation or project.

Question 8 - How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which QS components maintained files on Oswald? Why did OS have any files on Oswald?

OPS answered in CIA-16. Copy attached.

John:

Thank you for agreeing to participate in briefing the JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to be held on Monday, 17 March, at 2:00 p.m., in 2C06 IP Bldg. I regret the short notice. As we discussed, the ARRB has asked for information relating to the creation, transmission, and dissemination of cables and your name instantly came to mind. Their specific questions are:

1- Can you describe the cable process in place in the Agency during the 1960-1964 time period?

Prior to 1962 messages were delivered to the DPD (Development Products Division) at 1717 H Street or to the Communications Center at "L" Street. In addition there also was a Q building that received special traffic.

After 1962 messages came into the CIA Headquarters and were processed in different areas depending on the types of traffic.

Imagery traffic would be sent to to a specific floor for the imagery personnel. Intercept and Special Programs would either be passed to a Special Sections Area of the Communications Center or to the Cable Secretariat.

2- How did cables come in?

Messages came in from the field via the Brandy Station State Channels or military channels.

3- How were they decrypted?

Messages were deciphered using a OTT (One Time Tape) or a OTP (One Time Pad) process.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 110

4- What happened from the time a cable was sent from a field site until it arrived on a desk at Headquarters?

Messages sent from a field site would be passed to a communicator, encrypted and transmitted via High Frequency Radio. The message received from Brandy and relayed to headquarters and then it was decrypted. The analyst of the Cable Secretariat would then read the message and match what they read against customer requirements. They then would have a typist type the dissemination on the message. The message then would be picked up from the message center by the various staffs and or divisions.

5- How were cables disseminated?
See item four.

Please let me or Becky Rant, DA/IRO, know if you have any other questions or concerns prior to the briefing.

SUBJECT: Request No. CIA-16 from JFK Board

REFERENCE: CSI 97-062 dated 31 January 1997

1. (U) The Office of Personnel Security has researched this request from the Assassination Records Review Board relating to the existence of pre-assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald.

2. (U) In response to the specific questions listed in Mr. Marwell's letter to the Historical Review Group, the following responses are provided to those three questions pertaining to the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are the best reasonable answers based on available information. Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to 1 October 1994.

Question 1: (U) Please identify, as specifically as possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: (U) At the time of the assassination, the Office of Security (OS) held two files which contained information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A file entitled Defectors File (#0341008) contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald,

and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in the automated security database known as the Management Data Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated system. This hand search produced the same results as the automated search of MDP/PS.

(U) In your request specific mention is made of an HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file), #0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along with numerous soft files. Since this material has been destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search of Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any of these files.

(U) Attached is all of the available information regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL files. This information was retrieved from Lydia Hoffman of the Information Management Branch/Records Control Section and from a review of general office administrative files.

Question 2: (U) Other than for the 201-289248 file on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and the documents that were in the file at the time of the assassination.

Response: (U) As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

(U) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project that involved opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South America. In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of mail with the acquired information referred to the Directorate of Operations.

(U) The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa 1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens defecting to other countries and information regarding foreign nationals considering defection to the United States. This compilation of information was received from press clippings, Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed services. The pre-assassination documents located in this file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959 entitled "U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at 15"

b. Department of State memorandum dated 25 October 1960 with attached list of American "defectors" from May 1959 to October 1960

c. Memorandum for Chief/Security Research Staff dated 31 October 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject: American Defectors

d. Memorandum for Deputy Director of Security dated 1 November 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject: American Defectors

e. Handwritten chart of defectors dated 26 August 1961

f. Defector outline prepared in October 1961 listing known defectors to the USSR, Red China, Cuba, and United Arab Republic.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

(U) The index reference to the Defectors File identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer printout of defectors which reflected limited biographic data on each name. This listing was maintained separately from the actual Defectors File; notations within the Defectors File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently charged to the Security Analysis Group of OS. Efforts to locate this listing or determine the disposition have been unsuccessful.

(U) Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings. Katie Nakai of this office at one time was assigned to the Security Analysis Group and recalls the Defector Machine Listing. From her recollection, this machine listing was approximately one and one-half inches thick and was in two parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical index of defector names with assigned numbers. The second part Listed the assigned numbers in numerical crder and contained limited information on each name.

(C) The Special Investigations Branch of Investigations Division is the current operating component encompassing most of the Security Analysis Group functions still conducted in OPS. Gail Jewell of this office was queried regarding office holdings relating to the Defector Machine Listing. Ms. Jewell had no knowledge of the listing and suggested William Gilbert as a resource. M. Gilbert, CIC Liaison Officer, could not recall the listing, opined it may have been destroyed, and suggested contacting Zachary Filis of the Counterintelligence Center (CIC).

(C) CIC assumed many of the functions previously conducted by the Security Analysis Group. Mr. Filis was queried regarding the possibility the Defector Machine Listing may have been transferred to CIC during the realignment of duties. Mr. Filis advised the Defector Machine Listing could not be located in CIC holdings; and he has made inquiries with Directorate of Operations counterparts regarding the listing.

(3) The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351-64) was established circa 1960. It appears this file was created as a separate repository for the numerous press clippings and reports received from other government agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR and his activities following his return to the United States. The first volume of this file appears to have been preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents contained in this file are as follows:

a. Department of State telegram #1304 from Moscow dated 31 October 1959

b. The Washington Post press clipping dated 1 November 1959 entitled "Ex-Marine Asks Soviet Citizenship"

c. Department of State Dispatch #234 from Moscow dated 2 November 1959

24 October 1963 (no mention of Oswald).

Question 4: (U) To the extent that Counterintelligence
and the Office of Security maintained pre-assassination
files on Oswald, please explain why those offices
maintained files on Oswald prior to the assassination.
In answering this question, please make appropriate
references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB)
and to any other materials (including organizational
charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and
organization reasons for which CI and OS would have
maintained such files.

Response: (U) It is believed that OS holdings on Lee
Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during
which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in
contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the
Department of State prepared reports on these contacts.
Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the
Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution
of these reports. In the beginning this material was
probably retained in the Defectors File. As the number of
documents on this person increased, a separate file was
created to be the repository of information on the alleged
American defector. There is a notation in the Defectors
File that a separate file exists on Oswald.

(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of
Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D.
Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-
assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a
majority of them contain a notation or the initials of
Marguerite D. Stevens, leading one to believe she was the
officer responsible for the collection, analysis, and filing
of this information.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 118

SECRET

(U) The Security Research Staff (SRS) was the component responsible for collecting, developing, and evaluating information of a counterintelligence nature to detect and/or prevent penetration of the Agency' s organization, employees, and activities by foreign or domestic organizations or individuals. SRS conducted research in connection with employee loyalty cases and maintained records identifying personalities, environments, and personal traits of individuals who had been of counterintelligence interest over the years. SRS maintained liaison with various government agencies in connection with counterintelligence activities and coordinated the counterintelligence effort throughout OS. Using organizational charts of this time period, SRS reported directly to the office of the Director CE Security.

(J) Don Staton of the OPS/Management Staff was queried regarding the mission and functions of SRS during the pre- assassination time period. Mr. Suaton made inquiries relating to the above request, and the CPS/Information Management Officer Ronda Allen retrieved retired policy records for review. The information on the mission and Function of SRS was retrieved from the archived Office of Security administrative and historical files as well as a review of the security file on Marguerite D. Stevens.

3. (5) For your information, a page-by-page review of the documents contained in the Defectors File (12 volumes) and Lee Harvey Oswald's file (7 volumes) has not been conducted for the purposes of this request. Our efforts were concentrated on the pre-assassination time frame.

4. (U) This review was conducted by Katie Nakai, OPS/CO/IMB, secure 40552.

CIA-12 (Shackley et al)

REFERENCE:
Shackley, Cross, Henry, Gupton (CIA-IR-12) DA/IRO No. 12

Bonnie:

This is with respect to your 26 February 1998 note wherein you asked that we check HRM for personnel files on Ron Cross, Bart Henry and William Morris Kent. In an effort to bring the status of this particular tasking (CIA-IR-12) up-to-date, I provide the following:

My records show that on 18 July 1997 Barry requested that we conduct file searches on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross, Bart Henry and Doug Gupton. We were advised by Barry, and as outlined in a 22 May 1996 letter from ARRB to John Pereira, that Cross, Henry and Gupton are pseudonyms used by CIA personnel who testified to the HSCA.

Notwithstanding, we tasked OPS and HRM to conduct searches on these individuals in an effort to locate files. On 22 December 1996, I advised Barry that HRM had located files on Ted Shackley and would provide them to Barry via this office once they arrived from AC. It is my understanding that Becky gave you the OPF yesterday. HRM advsied further that they had attempted to locate files on Cross, Henry and Gupton but failed to locate any files on these individuals in light of the fact that only the pseudos had been provided. We further advised that if in the future you have access to the true names, we will glady search again.

On 23 December 1997, I advised Barry that OPS had located files on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross and Doug Gupton and that the files were in OPS for review. They were unable to locate a record on Bart Henry. It is my understanding that you have not reviewed these files to date but are in the process of making arrangements to do so. Sue-Ann Pierson conducted the search back in July and I am certain that she will be glad to you in this matter (40000).

And lastly, I have no record of ever having received a request to search on William Morris Kent. Accordingly, I will request OPS and HRM to do so.

Please let me know if I have misinterpreted the status of this request. Thank you. Frieda

FROM: Janet A. Ecklund
Chief, Information Management Branch
Office of Personnel Security

SUBJECT: Request No. CIA-16 from JFK Board

REFERENCE: CSI 97-062 date 31 January 1997.

1. (U) The Office of Personnel Security has researched this request from the Assassination Records Review Board relating to the existence of pre-assassination files on Lee Harvey Oswald.

2. (U) In response to the specific questions listed in Mr. Marwell's letter to the Historical Review Group, the following responses are provided to those three questions pertaining to the Office of Personnel Security (OPS). These responses are the best reasonable answers based on available information. Please note OPS was known as the Office of Security prior to 1 October 1994.

Question 1: (U) Please identify, as specifically as possible, each file held by CIA on Oswald at the time of the assassination of President Kennedy.

Response: (U) At the time of the assassination, the Office of Security (OS) held two files which contained information on Lee. Harvey Oswald. A file entitled, Defectors File (#0341008) contained a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald,

and the Office of Security also had a subject file on Lee
Harvey Oswald (#0351164). This information was reflected in
the automated security database known as the Management Data
Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). These files were
originally miscellaneous files which were converted to the
above numbers circa 1964. A hand search was also conducted
of microfiche records which were superseded by the automated
system. This hand search produced the same results as the
automated search of MDP/PS.

(U) In your request specific mention is made of an
HTLINGUAL file. MDP/PS reflects OS maintained four official
files under this project--#0077826 (an administrative file),
#0090079, #0093466 (a general file), and #0119144. All of
the HTLINGUAL files were destroyed on 8 April 1994 along
with numerous soft files. Since this material has been
destroyed, OPS cannot definitively state whether these files
contained any information on Lee Harvey Oswald. A search of
Oswald's name did not produce an index reference to any of
these files.

(U) Attached is all of the available information
regarding the destruction of the HTLINGUAL files. This
information was retrieved from Lydia Hoffman of the
Information Management Branch/Records Control Section and
from a review of general office administrative files.

Question 2: (U) Other than for the 201-289248 file
on Oswald, please explain when each Oswald file was
opened, the purpose for the opening of the file, and
the documents that were in the file at the time of the
assassination.

Response: (U) As noted above, all HTLINGUAL files have
been destroyed. Since OS files are usually set up in
chronological sequence, a search of files with numbers in
close proximity to those recorded for HTLINGUAL was
undertaken. This search revealed the approximate opening
dates for the four official HTLINGUAL files as:

#0077826 Opened approximately July 1952
#0090079 Opened approximately February 1953
#0093466 Opened approximately July 1953
#0119144 Opened approximately May 1955

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

(U) HTLINGUAL was a Directorate of Operations project that involved opening incoming and outgoing mail destined to and from the Soviet Union, China, Pakistan, and South America. In OS this project was known as SRPOINTER with subprojects identified as WESTPOINTER, INDIAN, BANJO, and SETTER. OS conducted the actual opening and monitoring of mail with the acquired information referred to the Directorate of Operations.

(U) The Defectors File (#0341008) was established circa 1950 for the purpose of recording information on US citizens defecting to other countries and information regarding foreign nationals considering defection to the United States. This compilation of information was received from press clippings, Directorate of Operations reporting, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of State, and the various armed services. The pre-assassination documents located in this file relative to Lee Harvey Oswald are:

a. Washington Star press clipping of 26 November 1959 entitled "U.S. Defector to Reds Turned to Marx at 15"

b. Department of State memorandum dated 25 October 1960 with attached list of American "defectors" from May 1959 to October 1960

c. Memorandum for Chief/Security Research Staff dated 31 October 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject: American Defectors

d. Memorandum for Deputy Director of Security dated 1 November 1960 from M. D. Stevens, subject: American Defectors

e. Handwritten chart of defectors dated 26 August 1961

f. Defector outline prepared in October 1961 listing known defectors to the USSR, Red China, Cuba, and United Arab Republic.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 130

(U) The index reference to the Defectors File identifies a list dated 13 September 1966 which was known as the Defector Machine Listing. This listing was a computer printout of defectors which reflected limited biographic data on each name. This listing was maintained separately from the actual Defectors File; notations within the Defectors File show the Defector Machine Listing as permanently charged to the Security Analysis Group of OS. Efforts to locate this listing or determine the disposition have been unsuccessful.

(U) Information regarding the purpose of the Defectors File was gleaned from a quick review of selected holdings. Katie Nakai of this office at che time was assigned to the Security Analysis Group and recalls the Defector Machine Listing. From her recollection, this machine listing was approximately one and one-half inches thick and was in two parts. One part consisted of an alphabetical index of defector names with assigned numbers. The second part Listed the assigned numbers in numerical order and contained Limited information on each name.

(C) The Special Investigations Branch of Investigations Division is the current operating component encompassing most of the Security Analysis Group functions still conducted in OPS. Gail Jewell of this office was queried regarding office holdings relating to the Defector Machine Listing. Ms. Jewell had no knowledge of the listing and suggested William Gilbert as a resource. Mr. Gilbert, CIC Liaison Officer, could not recall the listing, opined it may have been destroyed, and suggested contacting Zachary Filis of the Counterintelligence Center (CIC).

(C) CIC assumed many of the functions previously conducted by the Security Analysis Group. Mr. Filis was queried regarding the possibility the Defector Machine Listing may have been transferred to CIC during the realignment of duties. Mr. Filis advised the Defector Machine Listing could not be located in CIC holdings; and he has made inquiries with Directorate of Operations counterparts regarding the listing.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 131

(U) The subject file pertaining to Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) was established circa 1960. It appears this file was created as a separate repository for the numerous press clippings and reports received from other government agencies on the defection of Lee Harvey Oswald to the USSR and his activities following his return to the United States. The first volume of this file appears to have been preserved as the pre-assassination file, and the documents contained in this file are as follows:

a. Department of State telegram #1304 from Moscow dated 31 October 1959

b. The Washington Post press clipping dated 1 November 1959 entitled "Ex-Marine Asks Soviet Citizenship"

In answering this question, please make appropriate references to the Clandestine Services Handbook (CSHB) and to any other materials (including organizational charts) that would help explain the jurisdictional and organization reasons for which CI and OS would have maintained such files.

Response: (U) It is believed that OS holdings on Lee Harvey Oswald began in 1959 with his travel to Russia during which he renounced his US citizenship. Oswald was in contact with the American Embassy in Moscow, and the Department of State prepared reports on these contacts. Most likely because of counterintelligence concerns, the Central Intelligence Agency was included in the distribution of these reports.

There is a notation in the Defectors File that a separate file exists on Oswald.

(U) Both the Defectors File (#0341008) and the file of Lee Harvey Oswald (#0351164) were handled by Marguerite D. Stevens of the OS/Security Research Staff during the pre-assassination time frame. Of the documents listed above, a majority of them contain a notation or the initials of Marguerite D.

DATE: 08/14/98 09:10:11 AM
SUBJECT: Response to CIA-IR-11

Barry & Gary:

I have reviewed the draft response to CIA-IR-11 dated 13 August 1998 and following are my comments and requested changes:

Paragraphs 1 and 2 - OK

Para 2a: EPSTEIN, Edward J. --The DO found no files identifiable with subject; a file was found on an individual with the same name but; with research, it was determined that the individual was not the Edward J. Epstein who is the subject of this request. DA searches found a Center for CIA Security, formerly the Office of Personnel Security, file and a Publications Review Board file on subject, as well as three "hits" to records destroyed pursuant to normal records destruction schedules. The destroyed records involved three Freedom of Information requests that mention Epstein's name in the subject line. None of the requests were for information on Epstein.

Para 2b: LANE, Mark
4th line - Please change Public Affairs to Privacy Act request

Para 2c: MEAGHER, Sylvia -- A reference to the fact subject made a Privacy Act request was found. In addition, the Center for CIA Security found that it had, at one time, a folder on subject and a 1968 Ramparts Magazine article. Both subject's Privacy Act request file and the impersonal folder have been destroyed pursuant to normal record control schedules.

Para 2d: defer to DO

CSI/HRG, JFK Project Officer

FROM: Janet A. Ecklund
Chief, Information Management Branch.
Office of Personnel Security

SUBJECT: Priority Requests from JFK Board

REFERENCE: Request dated 17 December 1996

1. (C) In response to referenced request for "additional files" searches on Spas T. Raikin and Marilyn Dorothy Murret, the Office of Personnel Security conducted appropriate searches of the Management Data Program/Personnel Security (MDP/PS). MDP/PS is the automated database of security records used by the Office of Personnel Security. The searches undertaken were reasonably calculated to uncover all responsive records.

2. (C) The Office of Personnel Security has a file on Spas T. Raikin (#0134669). This file reflects that in August 1957 Foreign Documents Division/00 requested a clearance on Spas T. Raikin for unclassified contract employment with Project U.S. Joint Publications Research Service in New York City on an unwitting basis. The Office of Security responded there was no information which would preclude use of Mr. Raikin. On 31 January 1967 the Office of Security again granted approval for Mr. Raikin to be used as an unwitting independent contractor with the U.S. Joint Publications Research Service.

3. (C) The Office of Personnel Security does not maintain a security file on Marilyn Dorothy Murret, but there is an index record to an media article dated 1971 from Computers and Automation. This article contains the statement that Marylyn Murrett is Lee Harvey Oswald's cousin and that evidence indicates she was involved in espionage activities in Russia and Asia.

4. (U) This review was prepared by Katie Nakai, OPS/CD/IMB, secure 40552.

Frieda,

I have completed searches for Andrew Anderson as Anderson for maximum hits, on Howard Guebler under Guebler, on Gordon Novel under Novel and Edward Butler under Butler, all last names for maximum possible hits. My searchs on these four individuals produced no hits, no records, and no indexed data on one and all.

I note the presumption *"Evidently, he (Anderson) was a former employee"* because he had a AIN number of 0 800211. An AIN number is an Agency Identification Number, not necessarily suggesting an *"employee"* relationship. An *"EIN"* is an Employee Identification Number, but what categories of employment fall under it, I'm not prepared to say.

Dan

Dan,
Barry Harrelson, the JFK Project Officer, is requesting that you search once again under the name of Andrew (Andy) Anderson in light of the fact that CCS has located a file on one Andrew Clarence Anderson (ΑΙΝ 0 800211). Evidently, he was a former employee. I regret that we did not have this information prior to tasking you the first time.

SUBJECT: PRIORITY-CIA-IR-27 - ARRB Request for Security Files on 5 Individuals (DA/IRO No. 14)

Curt:

In response to CIA-IR-27, on 26 September 1997 OPS advised Barry Harrelson (JFK Project Officer) that security records are available for review by his office on the following individuals:

NAGELL, Richard C.
NOVEL, Gordon D.
RUBY, Jack L.
SHERIDAN, Walter J.
WEISBERG, Harold

Barry has just advised that the files on Nagell, Novel and Ruby have been identified as Assassination Records. Accordingly, they have requested that OPS transfer these files to DCI/CSI/HRG (J. Barry Harrelson) for inclusion in these records. Barry has further advised that a copy of the documents from each file would be acceptable if OPS prefers.

This is with respect to the files on Walter J. SHERIDAN and Harold WEISBERG. Barry has asked that arrangements be made for these files to be reviewed by the ARRB to determine which documents in each of these files are Assassination Records. In light of a short deadline, it is requested that the arrangements be made early in February. Once documents have been selected, Barry will need copies of those documents as well.

Please keep Becky and me posted with respect to these requests. Thanks in advance for your assistance. Frieda

Memorandum For The Record

Subject: Lewinter, Oswald

Oswald LeWinter came to the attention of the Office of Security in December 1991. CIA/Public Affairs advised LeWinter apparently approached the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) claiming to be a former CIA officer. LeWinter volunteered to provide information about Agency operations overseas. His offer was in conjunction with a six part television series being produced by the BBC based upon the book "The Agency" by John Ranelagh.

LeWinter is a known fabricator and has used the following aliases; Oscar LeWinter, Ibrahimir Razin, Razin LeWinter. LeWinter is indexed to the OS crank file.

LeWinter is also known as a fabricator to the CIC.

NOTE TO: ARRB Staff

SUBJECT: Further Clarification

REFERENCE: ARRB Request Regarding Oswald Lewinter

Clarification:

Oswald Lewinter is a naturalized US citizen and a man of at least four other names -- George Mearah, Oscar Lewinter, Razin Lewinter, and Ibrahimin Razin. Although he appeared in the East German Who's Who in CIA, the CIA has never had any *official* affiliation with Lewinter. Lewinter was the subject of an Agency "burn notice" in 1990; a burn notice alerts the intelligence community. In this case, the alert advised that Lewinter was an intelligence swindler, peddler, and fabricator.

CIA has a report of an episode involving an intelligence fabricator and convicted drug dealer Oswald Lewinter, AKA George Mearah, born 2 April 1931, in Vienna, Austria. In July 1990, a CIA representative overseas reported that Lewinter, using the name of George Mearah, contacted him and offered to put high-level GDR officials wishing to defect in touch with our representative and in turn the CIA. This contact would be in exchange for help and a presidential pardon that would wipe the slate clean and leave Lewinter (Mearah) without a record as a convicted felon. Lewinter (Mearah) claimed this was important he was married (for the third time) and starting a new life; he was reportedly considering quietly acquiring Israeli citizenship. This contact was not followed up because of the "burn notice."

1. Per the Review Board staff's request the following is a brief explanation of how the Directorate of Operations (DO) processed cables in the 1963/1964 time-frame. "As we are unable to locate any definitive records on the subject, and in all probability none ever existed, the information provided is based solely on the memory of DO officers familiar with procedures in place at the time.

2. Each area division in the DO maintained and staffed its own registry. Although each registry was configured to meet each division's unique requirements, there were common functions performed by all the registries to include: collecting, sorting, and delivering of incoming cables; maintenance of incoming and outgoing cable "chronos"; collecting and delivering of incoming and outgoing pouch material; and the issuance and maintenance of "pseudo and alias" card files.

3. To the specific question regarding processing of cables, on a daily basis, usually six day per week, each registry collected its incoming cable traffic from a central processing point, then called the Cable Secretariate, within the Office of Communications. The incoming cables were then sorted by registry personnel according to pre-defined guidelines. These guidelines were unique to each division and were frequently altered to meet changing operational requirements. Sorted cables were then delivered to specific operational/area desks. A "chrono" copy of each was maintained, on a temporary basis, usually for 90 days and then destroyed.

4. Outgoing cables were created and coordinated by appropriate operational/area desks and usually released by the chief of the division or a designated releasing officer. "Released" cables were then hand delivered or sent by pneumatic tube system ( a system long ago dismantled from the original Headquarters building) to Cable Secretariate for processing into the Agency's communication network. "Chrono" copies of outgoing cables were forwarded to the registry for a 90 day hold and then destroyed.

5. It is important to note that the cable scenario outlined here is general in nature and that throughout their existence registries and their procedures were frequently altered until the registry system as described above was eliminated in the mid-1980's.

# Declaration of Teresa F. Wilcox

I, Teresa F. Wilcox, hereby declare and say as follows:

1. (AIUO) I am the Information Review Officer (IRO) for the Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T). I was appointed to this position in February 1996, and have held various professional positions within the Central Intelligence Agency since 1985. I am responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the DS&T, to include the Offices of the Deputy Director for Science and Technology and the Associate Deputy Director for Science and Technology; the Office of Technical Service (OTS); the Office of Technical Collection (OTC); the Clandestine Information Technology Office (CITO); the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS); the Office of Development and Engineering (OD&E); the Office of Advanced Analytic Tools (AAT); the Office of Advanced Projects (OAP); and the Office of Research and Development (ORD). In addition, I am responsible for searching and reviewing certain records of the former National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC).

2. (AIUO) I am aware that the DS&T has searched appropriate records systems for information responsive to all requests the DS&T has received. I have obtained this knowledge through my personal experience, as well my conversations with, and my review of the records of, the former DS&T IRO Anthony R. Frasketi, and the DS&T Information Management Officer, Marsha A. Hubbs.

3. (AIUO) The following is a description of DS&T searches and review of documents undertaken in response to Board taskings the DS&T has received.

CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart. The DS&T made deletions to security records located by the Directorate of Administration. The DS&T Searched ODDS&T records for Capehart's medical file. The DS&T forwarded the medical file to the Board for its review.

CIA-IR-08 Family Jewels Memorandum. The DS&T reviewed a package of documents forwarded by Barry Harrelson. The DS&T advised the Board it had no objection to ARRB access.

CIA-IR-15 Electronic ‘take’ from Mexico City Station. This memorandum addresses the portion of the action, “In addition, the Board is still awaiting a response on the present location of Staff D records. Regardless of the outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board continues to seek a full accounting for all surveillance conducted during the relevant time periods."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 186

In conducting a search for the above information, the DS&T located in OTS records a file with the folder title, "Mexico City, Mexico." We forwarded the entire contents of that folder for the period 24 May 1961 to 10 June 1965, with one exception. Three Operational Monthly Reports were forwarded to the Board. The dates covered were 1-30 September 1963; 1-31 October 1963; and 1-30 November 1963. The attachment to Dispatch HMMA 20307 dated 4 December 1962 was not included. It was a poor-quality audio tape in Spanish, between two individuals talking about office procedures. No substantive information was exchanged during this conversation.

The DS&T also conducted a search of OTC records. This office would have inherited the Division D records of the Directorate of Operations (DO). We reviewed old DO Records Retirement Requests; there are no shelflists (folder-inventory) associated with these Records Retirement Requests since the Division D records were recorded initially in the DO system. We forwarded for the Board's review the six Records Retirement Request whose job numbers reflected the years 1959 to 1962. We advised the Board that Records Center records indicated the records' disposition as follows:

1. 59-S-477: Destroyed September 1977.
2. 60-S-182R: Destroyed May 1980.
3. 60-S-402: Transferred to FI/D(DDO), December 1977.
4. 61-S-157R: Four boxes transferred to FI/D (DDO), March 1972; three boxes destroyed, May 1980.
5. 62-S-885: Destroyed (no date given).
6. 62S000986R: Transferred to the Office of SIGINT Operations (DS&T).

These were the only Records Retirement Requests in the possession of OTC that are in the time frame relevant to the JFK assassination. As their descriptions indicate, they do not appear relevant to the request.

The DS&T also conducted a search of CITO records. This DS&T office inherited some files from OTC when CITO was established. We searched its records in the event some Division D records were held by CITO. These searches identified no responsive records.

Searches of OTS, OTC, and CITO records used the following keywords:

surveil*
Russian
USSR
Cuba*
audio*
electron*
embassy
Mexico*


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 187

## CIA-IR-16 U-2 Files.

The DS&T provided the Board a copy of the U-2 shelflist. We also searched for records filed under Richard Bissell's name. We received no follow-on request from the Board.

## CIA-IR-16 FBIS-USR-92-112.

The DS&T provided to the Board a translation of articles about a KGB file on Oswald.

## CIA-IR-17 DS&T Records on Castro Assassination Plots.

Records of the ODDS&T, OTC, and OTS were searched for the following keywords: Castro, Oswalt, Oswald, assas*, and KDBADGER. In addition, we searched OTS records on the following: Project ZRRIFLE, Mollusca, Cubela, Black Leaf, ballpoint pen, hypodermic syringe, Artime, silencer, gambling, aerosol, cigar, depilatory, wiretapping, Phyllis McGuire, skin diving suit, sea shell, and project AMLASH. As a result of these searches, we provided to the Board a document titled, "Handwriting Analysis - AMLASH-1," dated 7 April 1965.

## CIA-IR-25 Zapruder Film.

A search was conducted on records of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (records of the former National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) and Office of Imagery Analysis) using the terms Zapruder, JFK, Commission, and 1963. Hits on year 1963 did not reveal any pertinent information. We located no record of a "William Green" at NPIC in November 1963. We located no log books or indexes regarding the processing or handling of any assassination films. We also reviewed an audiotaped interview with a former NPIC employee, and made minimal deletions to the tape.

## CIA-IR-33 Search of FBIS records for any files on Oswald,

and request for information on how FBIS-USR92-112 was filed. No past or present files were found. An explanation on how FBIS-USR-92-112 was filed was provided.

## Review of three Ford Library Documents (178-10003-10453, 178-10004-10087, 178-10002-10394.

Made deletions and deferred to the DO on 178-10002-10394. Made deletions to Summary Report on CIA Investigation of MKNAOMI.

## Review of two terms.

The DS&T advised that the terms should not be released because of ongoing CIA activity at the location.

## Review of Alias Documentation issue (104-10220-10179, - 10181, and -10188).

Requested that Board postpone release of specific information. A search of OTS records indicated OTS had no records on particular documents in the 1960s and 1970s.

## Review of a slug in current use.

Requested that the Board postpone its release because the slug is in current use.

## JFK Declaration of FREDRICK C. WICKHAM, JR.

I, Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr. declare and say as follows:

1. (U) I am the JFK Focal point Officer (“FPO") for the Directorate of Operations ("DO") of the United States Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA"). I have held technical positions associated with the design and implementation of computer systems, information management positions including the DO IMO, and currently manage the DO information review and release programs. I have been with the CIA since 1967 and have been associated with the JFK records review activity since 1992 and the JFK FPO since 1995.

2. (U) I have obtained the information contained in this declaration based upon my personal knowledge and experience, as well as conversations with the DO Information Review Officer, the DO Information Management Officer and individuals taking action on the specific requests.

3. (U) DO records were predominately paper with a hard copy card index in the 1960's and an electronic index in the 1970's. The indices were based upon names that meet specific collection requirements or projects that were undertaken in the performance of our mission. Searches that exceeded the capability of the indices required manual paper file searches. I am aware that the DO searched the central record system, which includes retired records, and hand searched the convenience files and specialized files located within various offices. Specialized collections are often extremely sensitive and therefore only reside within the components. During our newer searches we have not found any significant documents in the DO files dated 1978 or prior that appear to have been missed by the searches through 1978. We did locate one set of tapes which we know was made available to the Warren Commission but was not included in the HSCA sequestered collection. We also found one file that was only partially included in the HSCA sequestered collection.

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

4. (S) Many of the searches performed today are not significantly different than the ones done during the period of the various commissions and committees. The searches performed since 1995 still use the index to the central record system the same as in 1978 but we have a couple of new databases that were not available in 1978. We now capture all cable traffic electronically and are able to perform text searches of that repository. That repository post-dates the HSCA so it is not useful in locating older records. Additionally, we have converted a small amount of very sensitive paper files into computer searchable form. While these specific collections are part of the DO's record system, they were not electronically searchable nor were they included within the indices to the DO's central records system. We have searched all of these records systems for information responsive to requests the DO has received. Some of the specific requests could not be satisfied by the electronic searches and we resorted to manual paper searches in an effort to locate the information.

5. (U) The DO provided several briefings to the Assassination Records Review Board and their staff, starting in 1995, to describe the records created by the DO and the record system that manages that information. We also described what is meant by the need to continue protection of sources and methods, and the impacts the revelation of information would have on the lives of individuals and current operations. The presenters included the Agency's General Counsel, Deputy Director for Operations, Chief of the Information Management Staff, and several other DO managers associated with the conduct of operations and protection of sources and methods. We also provided detailed descriptions of current operations. We provided information about specific individuals whose lives or livelihood would be threatened as examples of harm that would occur if certain information was released. Additionally, we presented a description of the operational environment that existed and the intensity under which searches were performed in the wake of the assassination.

6. (U) The CIA issued an Agency-wide employee bulletin for a new search for JFK Assassination records (OIM 98-0081, dated 30 July 1998). As requested by the ARRB, the DO distributed the employee bulletin via Lotus Notes on 17


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 191

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

August and placed it on the morning message that people receive when they first log onto the system.

7. (U) We have received numerous specific requests for additional information. Based on personal knowledge and on information reflected in our records, I am aware of the following efforts that were conducted in responding to specific ARRB requests for DO records. I have abbreviated the questions to save space:

CIA-1 - Information on the organization of CIA

(U) The March 1995 ARRB request called for the availability of "comprehensive organizational charts (or the best available substitutes)." The request contained about three pages of various requirements, including:

A. organizational charts of the Directorate of Plans (DDP); “CIA Stations . . . in Mexico City (1960-68 only), Miami, other stations that we will discuss orally;" any other offices . . . any pro-Castro groups, . . or anti-Castro groups;

B. names and affiliations of all CIA personnel responsible for liaison with the Warren Commission, the House Select Committee on Assassinations, . . ;

C. all manuals, handbooks, . . . guides explaining: . . organizational structure, . . . filing systems, . . . for drafting memoranda;

D. copies of the instructions, guidelines, and other materials used by your reviewers;

(U) Over a thousand pages of material were provided in responding to this request.

(U) In May 1997 the ARRB further requested that 35 pages from CSN 5-50, 2 pages of the JMWAVE chart, and


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 192

SECRET

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

13 pages from Regulation No. 1-130 and HR #1 be reviewed for release.

(U) Although the AARB staff had access to all of the requested material, in January 1998 the Agency answered that the various CSN 5-50 pages contained basic information regarding the mission and functions of the Office of Operations (now the Directorate of Operations (DO)) and could not be released. However, in April 1998, we agreed to provide structure charts for the DDP in 1961 and 1963, with Division and Staff titles and a JMWAVE Chart.

CIA-2 - Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U) The ARRB request was dated May 1995 and was six pages of file code numbers, crypts, names, dispatch designators, and cable location designators and requested identification thereof. A variety of methods of responses was utilized, (some dated June and July 1995 and some undated) to answer, including a paired listing (returned to CIA) microfilm file summary sheets, and descriptive sheets.

CIA-3 - Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U) This ARRB request was dated June 1995 and was three more pages of queries similar to CIA-2. A variety of methods of responses was utilized, (some dated June 1995 and some undated) to answer, including a paired listing marked (returned to CIA), microfilm file summary sheets, and handwritten notes.

CIA-4 - Confirmation of/Queries About Some Information

(U) This four-page ARRB request dated June 1995 was for "descriptions of each crypt, a brief identification of each individual . . . , and indications of whether these crypts, operations, and

(U) This ARRB request was dated July 1995 and was for identification of some twelve crypts, names, file codes, or acronyms. This was answered by a paired listing dated July 1995 (Returned to CIA).

CIA-6 -- Request for Systematic Review of Traffic

(U) This request was dated September 1995 and was for "the CIA to assemble all of the cable traffic and dispatches for . . . September 26, 1963 through October 20, 1963 and November 22, 1963 through December 30, 1963 between": . . . Mexico City and Headquarters and Mexico City and JMWAVE.

(C) The DO provided a classified response in January 1998. All cable traffic and dispatches for the period September 26, 1963 through October 20, 1963 and November 22, 1963 through December 30, 1963 between: (a) the Mexico city Station and Headquarters, and (B) the Mexico City Station and JMWAVE are not available as a chronological collection. The Office of Communications (OC) only held cables long enough to ensure that they were successfully transmitted to the recipient. Because processes and resources to perform cleanup activity varies, cables were sometimes held for longer periods but not with the intention of becoming a long-term reference collection. The offices of record for the origination of cable traffic and dispatches did not create files in this manner. The desks maintained a temporary paper cable chrono. These were not usually retained for more than 90 days. There is no electronic repository for cables and dispatches from the stations. Cables were printed out and went into specific files dealing with subjects or operations. Accordingly, it is not possible to recreate as a collection all of the requested cables and dispatches.

CIA-10 -- Interagency Source Register

(U) This request was dated June 1996. The DO provided a classified response to the ARRB together

11

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 200

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

with a copy of DOI 50-46, “The Interagency Source Register,” and advised that an unclassified response was not possible.

CIA-11 -- Sylvia Duran Materials

(U) This request was dated May 1996 and was "in particular . . . [for] a 'ten-page statement' she may have given to the Mexican police." IMS/ESG "searched its main index system, its 'names' data base, and hard copy files." The Agency response, dated October 1997, indicated to the ARRB that "no such 'statement' has ever been found and we cannot confirm that it ever existed."

CIA-12 -- Files on five persons allegedly connected with JMWAVE

(U) This ARRB request was dated May 1996 for "all 201 files, personnel files, Office of Security files, P-files, or any other files related to . . . David Sanchez Morales . . . Ted Shackley . . . Ron Cross . . . Bart Henry and Doug Gupton.

(U) The DO maintains no files on former employees, such as Morales, Shackley, or Gupton (P).

(U) In a response dated August 1998, the DO responded to DA/OIM/HRP/JFK that we were unable to identify Ron Cross and Bart Henry as true names, registered aliases, or pseudonyms and, therefore, could not provide any files.

CIA - 13 - Mexico City Back-channel Communications

(U) The DO provided a classified response explaining that these types of communications are usually administrative matters, e.g., they contain sensitive personnel information and they are not placed in operational files or saved, collectively, in other


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 201

SECRET

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

databases. Unfortunately, there is no way of
retrieving these cables through a reasonable search
using any generic or specific term, since cables were
not captured by any organized filing process.

CIA - 14 - Mexico City Station Annual Reports

(U) The DO was asked for specific annual reports from
Mexico City.

(S) We informed the ARRB that we were successful in
locating an official DO file which contained station
"annual reports" for the years 1957 through 1973. The
file included two dispatches which forwarded the RMDS
from Mexico Station for the years 1960 and 1961.
However, the RMDs, which were sent as separate
attachments (sent in a different pouch from the
covering dispatch memorandum) were not present in the
file. (NOTE: Attachments which contained true names
of CIA officers or assets or information that would
identify operational sources with CIA were customarily
sent in separate transmissions as a security measure if
a pouch(es) were compromised). We also note that in
a speed letter, dated 1978, written by DDO/LA/STB to
OLC, that the RMDs for Mexico City Station, for the
years, 1962, 1963, or 1964 could not be located.

(S) Based upon further review, we are providing an
updated response to the ARRB as follow: The only
report that was annually required of a station was that
relating to its ability to meet its mission directives,
now called "operational directives". These annual
reports called the Station's "Relative Mission
Directives" (RMD) were used to compose an overall
annual division or staff submission to the Deputy
Director for Operations, as an evaluative tool. The
RMDs, themselves are a summary of station activities
reported to Headquarters in other correspondence during
the course of the year, were used to compile a division
level evaluation--in a sense, an annual report card--on
how it was doing against operational requirements. The
station reporting was extracted into the larger

13

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 202

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

division summary, much as it is today. The RMDs from year-to-year could and often did change with the operational requirements the Agency was expected to fulfill. As such, the RMDs for each station had value only as data to the larger examination of how the Agency performed its intelligence mission in a given year and what trends or changes this review would suggest for the ensuing year.

(U) Station reporting of the type described above would be treated as transitory information and as such meet the definition of a temporary record. It is entirely possible and quite probable that these facilitative reports were systematically destroyed. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) authorized the Agency to destroy facilitative reports in 1954 (NARA Reference: II-NNA-1057); the destruction of intelligence collection requirement files in 1962 (NARA Reference: NN-163-1), and operational management objective files at the subcomponent level (which would include reports from. Stations and base) in 1977 (NARA Reference: NC1-263-77-10). The 1977 authorization remains in force today.

CIA - 15 - Win Scott files from Russ Holmes files

(U) The Retired Record Table RRT shows Mr. Scott's Mexico City files were retired as Job 78- 00594R on 11 August 1972. These records were retired to the Agency's Archives and Records Center under Item Number 40-76 in the Records Control Schedule in effect at the time. Files under Item Number 40-76 were described as:

"Temporary. Destroy on completion of specific job or as they serve their purpose. Return folders and documents on loan and destroy remaining papers."

The RRT shows Job 78-00594R was destroyed on 12 January 1987.

The RRT page showing the disposition of Mr. Scott's files and the page of the Records Control Schedule which describes Item Number 40-76 have been

incorporated in the Agency's JFK collection and will be processed for release to NARA.

## CIA - 16 - Oswald Pre-Assassination Files

(S) The Directorate of Operations reviewed the DO records to determine if there were any additional files containing pre-assassination records relating to Oswald. Research identified a document in the Oswald 201 which appeared to be a file inventory. The document identified CI Staff as the file custodian. CIC has confirmed that all CI Staff holdings were incorporated into the 201.

(S) Prior to establishing a 201, any documents received would have been placed in an operational interest file. We found no reference to the existence of an operational interest file. If such a file had existed, however, it might not have been registered in the central index. It was standard procedure that upon opening a 201, the documents from an operational interest file would be transferred to the 201.

(S) Given that Oswald was a subject of the HTLINGUAL operation, it is reasonable to believe that there was a file on him. We destroyed all of the HTLINGUAL files under court order, and no record was made of what files existed. We did not review all of the DO record system to destroy all copies of material which may have been derived from HTLINGUAL material. We know, for instance, that there are HTLINGUAL items related to Oswald in the HSCA sequestered collection.

(S) In sum, the 201 on Oswald contains all the information we are aware of that we had prior to the assassination.

## CIA-IR-01 - Personnel Assigned to Post from 1959-1964

(S) The request for a listing of personnel assigned to Moscow 1959-1964 was discussed with Board

15

-SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 204

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

Staff. Instead of a listing, the files on individuals who were assigned to Moscow and a history of the Moscow Station were made available. In addition, the staff interviewed a former COS Moscow. The Board staff is satisfied with the response and will prepare its own documentation.

CIA-IR-03 - Full Computer Search for List of HTLINGUAL Files

(C) First, as an outcome of the Pike and Church Committees investigations, all HTLINGUAL files which were identifiable, as such, were destroyed under court order. Copies of materials from these files that may have been made prior to the destruction order and put into other files have, however, surfaced as files are reviewed. This includes material in the HSCA sequestered collection.

(C) The DO ran a search on the term "HTLINGUAL." Some records were identified as destroyed. Some were not so marked but are not locatable under the job number identified; however, given that there is no requirement to record destroyed records under the Federal statutes for disposition programs and given limited resources for noting files destroyed, this is not uncommon. The HTLINGUAL search further identified files because they had been the subject of Freedom of Information Act queries; however, these were not HTLINGUAL files per se, but files which contained the FOIA requester queries for HTLINGUAL information.

(U) ARRB staff member Michelle Combs has reviewed the HTLINGUAL file run and has selected some folders for review. OIM has identified that they have only redacted records for the large FOIA case that is listed. IMS/ESG/HCS is retrieving its records for unredacted copies of the records and will make them available.

CIA-IR-04 - Disposition of Angleton Files


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

# SECRET

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(U) The DO provided the following unclassified response about the Angleton Files: The files that Kalaris mentioned in Mangold's book were incorporated with the files of the CI staff. Per memorandum dated 1976-1979, the CI files were reviewed and incorporated into the DO record system. Items that were duplicates or not worthy of retention were destroyed. The memos describe the file collection and the process that was followed. Because the files that were once known as Angleton's have been dispersed within the DO records, they are no longer identifiable as a collection.

CIA-IR-06 -- QKENCHANT

(U) IMS/ESG/HCS initially provided a classified response to DA/OIM/JFK for this request in February 1998. In a follow-up response for declassification of the response, IMS/ESG/HCS worked with the providing office and then approved DA/OIM/JFK's unclassified response.

CIA-IR-07 - Claude Barnes Capehart

(U) The DO provided a classified response, which stated that we found *no record* when conducting a name trace for records on Capehart. Subsequently, we were advised by the CIA's Project Manager, Mr. J. Barry Harrelson, that this request was primarily being researched by the Directorate for Science & Technology.

CIA-IR-09 -- George Bush

(S) The ARRB requested information about George Bush because of a reference to "George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency" in a certain FBI document dated November 1963.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 206

# SECRET

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(S) IMS/FAB provided a main index search response to IMS/ESG/HCS. A 201 (that dated back only to 1977) and a DCD file were located.

(U) DA/OIM/JFK responded to the ARRB in February 1998 that the "search determined the Agency has no record of any association with George Herbert Walker Bush during the 1963 time period."

CIA-IR-11 - Warren Commission critics (Does CIA maintain files or records on specified critics - other than press clippings?)

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response for "any files or records on Warren Commission critics Edward J. Epstein, Josiah Thompson, Mark Lane, Harold Weisberg, or Sylvia Meagher below. In addition to these records, our research did surface a reference to a file titled "Garrison Investigation of Kennedy Assassination" which was opened in 1969 and closed in 1996. At the direction of the ARRB staff, no material in response to FOIA requests or news clippings in Public Affairs was included.

A. Edward J. EPSTEIN - The DO has no identifiable information on subject. Our search did surface the name Edward Epstein; however, by using additional biographic data known about subject, we were able to dismiss this name as a false "hit."

B. Josiah THOMPSON - Subject was of operational interest to the DO circa 1962; therefore, a 201 file does exist on this individual. ARRB staff member Combs reviewed this file in August 1998.

C. Mark LANE - Our search produced references to two documents: (1) An Agency dispatch from Germany dated 23 January 1970, and (2) An OGC letter dated 29 March 1977. Both of these documents are available for review. The OGC letter concerns a 1976 FOIA request -- Mark Lane was one of the individuals requesting the FOIA action -- which involves two dispatches dated 1967

18

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

and 1968. Because these two documents are the subject of a FOIA request, they are not included in this response.

D. Harold Weisberg - There is a 201 file on subject which contains very limited information. This file can be made available for review by an ARRB staff member. The DO retired records system, CARD, has a reference to an Agency dispatch (EGBA-87605, 1969) which indicates subject was in correspondence with Julius Mader. This document was in the files when it was reviewed by staff member Combs in August 1998.

E. Sylvia Meagher We found no DO information.

CIA - IR-12 - Contacts with journalists or publishing houses

(U) The DO provided both an unclassified and classified response about contacts with journalists or publishing houses, regarding whether CIA might have attempted to influence any journalists or publishers regarding public discussion of the assassination. Searches with generic terms such as "journalists,” "publishers,” “publishing houses," and "media" would not produce meaningful responses. This question required the research of crypts mentioned in various documents in the JFK "assassination records." These crypts referred to projects managed under the overall guidance of a staff in the DO and in all instances were projects concerning press and propaganda programs designed to promote anti-communism and to counter Soviet press and propaganda initiatives worldwide. Specifically, the various projects were developed for the following reasons (Corresponding cryptonyms to these projects were provided in a classified document, and are not included below):

A. to counter Soviet activities in international intellectual organizations, in order to unite and promote anti-Communist intellectuals.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 208

B. to be involved in book publishing matters and the international distribution of anti-Communist books.

C. to purchase and distribute books.

D. to cover the international mailing of American books translated into Spanish and French languages.

Ε. to purchase and mail books to selected addressees in Latin America and Africa.

F. to cover a worldwide news and feature story service.

G. as a Press and Propaganda Developmental and Target of Opportunity project involving Latin America.

CIA-IR-13 -- Organized Crime

(S) As part of DA/OIM/JFK's research, IMS/ESG/HCS was requested to do a trace on "Charles Ford." The trace resulted in no hits.

(S) Later, to answer CIA-IR-03 on HTLINGUAL material, a computer run was made. The list contained a citation to testimony to Congress by Charles Ford in September of 1975. A copy of Ford's testimony to a Senate Committee regarding a Mafia connection to assassination plots against Castro was provided to DA/OIM/JFK in February 1998.

(U) At the request of HRP JFK, several project Crypts were searched and results provided in connection with this request.

CIA - IR-15 - Mexico City Station electronic surveillance and surveillance tapes

(S) The Directorate of Operations has checked Headquarters records for files referenced in HMMW 12454

20
SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

SECRET

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

and for files on the crypts cited in this document and searched for HMMA 20307 and other cables or dispatches cited in this document. As previously explained, the crypts in HMMW 12454 have been researched. The dispatch was apparently written in haste and in truncated language without correct knowledge of the operational crypts for the specific operations in Mexico City. The crypts in the dispatch are the more generic crypts for teltap operations, not for the then-current operations in Mexico City, which are in question.

(U) There has been considerable interest over the years in locating any electronic surveillance tapes that would have been made during the period that Oswald visited Mexico (26 September - 2 October 1963). A thorough search has been conducted of the DO's record system as well as the index to retired records in an attempt to locate any tapes and/or find documentation to resolve their disposition. We have discussed this issue with operational experts and their professional opinion is that most likely tapes such as these were never returned to Headquarters for retention. It was normal practice to recycle audio tapes after they had been listened to by transcribers and their transcripts made.

(U) Messages between field stations and headquarters used operational jargon and shortened sentence structures that can sometimes allow for misinterpretations. Thus, possible confusion was created when references to what was being sent to headquarters referred to "tapes" but really intend "information" from tapes.

(U) In our search efforts we did locate approximately 185 audio surveillance tapes of the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City that were recorded during the immediate time following the assassination (22 November 1963 to January 1964). The fact that these tapes were retained and returned to Headquarters could account for the fact that some people recall that some tapes existed which were sent to Headquarters.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 210

# SECRET

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(U) Based upon the search efforts that were undertaken and the opinions of operational experts consulted, CIA has concluded that the tapes in question do not exist and were almost certainly recycled in the normal course of business before their potential value was identified.

CIA-IR-18 - Information on one DO Office

(S) The DO provided an unclassified response on the "Defector Staff" listed in CSN 5-50 revised in October 1959 and the "CIA Defector Coordinator, DDP/CDC," revised in October 1963. The "Defector and Contract Personnel Branch" had the symbol SR/OS/D. Only Soviet Bloc (formerly Warsaw Pact countries) defector cases were handled by this branch. Staffs and branches identified, among other duties, were responsible for identifying, debriefing, and resettling foreign defectors of intelligence interest.

CIA-IR-21 -- DRE Monthly operational reports

(U) This request involved "Howard" and some extensive research for the name as a true name, pseudo, or alias for anyone out of JMWAVE and/or connected to the DRE operation.

(U) We also did extensive research for DRE monthly reports. In the JFK collection, there was a gap in the reporting between December 1962 and April 1964.

(U) This also covered the question of George Joannides' Performance Appraisal Reports and their inclusion in the collection with some redactions.

CIA-IR-22 - "A" file on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison

(U) The DO provided this unclassified response:

"It was the DO's understanding that there were illegible markings on pages of the copy of the "A" file on Clay Shaw. Legible copies were promised and have recently been delivered.

The DO has recently provided a copy of the "A" file on Jim Garrison."

CIA-IR-26 -- Jordan James Pfunter

(U) IMS/ESG/HCS did a records search on subject name. The information is contained in a 201 file and an A file. This information was provided to the ARRB by DA/OIM/JFK in February 1998, and they were advised that other information was available from a Third Agency.

CIA-IR-29 -- Oswald LeWinter

(U) The ARRB provided the name to be traced. Apparently he is/was claiming to be an Agency employee and the Acting Assistant Director of Counter Espionage.

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(S) A name trace was run. The resultant information was included in an IMS/ESG/HCS "clarification memo" for the ARRB. The text, which was classified "Secret," reads as follows:

"Oswald LeWinter is a naturalized US citizen and a man of at least four other names -- George Mearah, Oscar LeWinter, Razin LeWinter, and Ibrahimin Razin. Although he appeared in the East German Who's Who in CIA, the CIA has never had any official affiliation with LeWinter. LeWinter was the subject of an Agency “burn notice" in 1990; a burn notice alerts the intelligence community. In this case, the alert advised that LeWinter was an intelligence swindler, peddler, and fabricator. (C)

CIA has a report of an episode involving an intelligence fabricator and convicted drug dealer Oswald LeWinter, AKA George Mearah, born 2 April 1931, in Vienna, Austria. In July 1990, a CIA representative overseas reported that LeWinter, using the name of George Mearah, contacted him and offered to put high-level GDR officials wishing to defect in touch with our representative and in turn the CIA. This contact would be in exchange for help and a presidential pardon that would wipe the slate clean and leave LeWinter (Mearah) without a record as a convicted felon. LeWinter (Mearah) claimed this was important [because] he was married (for the third time) and starting a new life; he was reportedly considering quietly acquiring Israeli citizenship. This contact was not followed up because of the "burn notice."

CIA-IR-30 -- Cherepanov Papers

(U) This undated and undocumented request from the ARRB was derived from a passage in the book Molehunter (pp. 121-123) regarding the Cherepanov papers.

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

IMS/ESG/HCS located a workbook copy in English and provided access to ARRB staffer Michelle Combs. She was further offered access to the original Russian copies. Combs then wrote a memorandum dated April 1997 that identified the collection as papers that "primarily examine the habits, potential vulnerabilities, and KGB approaches made to various members of the American Embassy staff." Combs went on to say that "no information of believed relevance to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy was found in these papers. No pages were designated as assassination records."

CIA-IR-32 -- AMWORLD

(C) The confidential draft of the IMS/ESG/HCS response was shown to ARRB staffer Combs in February 1998. That text follows:

"(C) **CIA-IR-32 AMWORLD.** The Review Board seeks information regarding the purpose of AMWORLD and its connection with the Cuban exile groups. After a thorough search of the DO records system, to include telephonic communications with various DO Latin American Division officers, we formulated the following as a definition of the purpose of the AMWORLD operation. The AMWORLD operation was a covert Agency effort to provide support to several Cuban exile groups. This was an "autonomous" operation designed to bring the exile groups under the direct control of Manuel Artime Buesa. AMWORLD's mission was to cause a popular uprising in Cuba through the use of propaganda and paramilitary forces to ultimately overthrow Fidel Castro.

(C) The Agency provided direct and indirect financial aid and technical advisory support to these groups but did not participate directly in the day-to-day operations. ARTIME was responsible for recruitment of AMWORLD

personnel; he obtained sites for training and deployment, and he had primary responsible for day-to-day operations. AMWORLD was based in three locations. The AMWORLD propaganda efforts were based in Costa Rico. The paramilitary efforts were run out of the Nicaragua base. The third base was located in Miami to service AMWORLD requirements including the collection of operational leads, servicing of dead drops and assisting in the vetting of AMWORLD personnel."

(C) Combs asked two follow up questions: Was part of the program to put in place a government in exile? Was there ever a government in exile? IMS/ESG/HCS put these questions to LA and DO/IRO. The DO/IRO has provided the following additional write up, classified confidential:

``(C) Based on file reviews and recollections from officers involved in the Cuban program, there was never a Cuban Government in Exile. During the planning for the Bay of Pigs operation it was envisioned that after the invasion site had been secured, Miro Cardona and the Cuban Revolutionary Council would be flown to the area to establish a new Cuban Government. The invasion site was never secured.

(C) The AMWORLD Project, begun well after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion and after the release of Manuel Artime Buesa and other Bay of Pigs veterans from Cuban prisons, was designed to support and unite several Cuban exile groups under the control of Artime in an effort to enhance the cohesion of the exiles and augment Artime's capability to launch propaganda and paramilitary attacks against the Cuban mainland. The overall mission of AMWORLD was to foment a popular uprising in Cuba which could lead to the ultimate overthrow of Fidel Castro. There is no evidence that AMWORLD's mission even remotely came close to fruition and no evidence that a projected government in exile was ever considered as a viable option."

CIA-IR-34 -- Files of CIA officials/offices

(U) IMS/ESG/HCS ran a computer search for 'OPI 40" files. This computer run was then made available to ARRB staff member Michelle Combs for review. Her review encompasses some 42 boxes from a variety of retired DDP files. The identified folders were gathered in an aggregate of seven boxes (including one that is exclusively microfilm and microfiche of so-called Registry logs).

(U) The ARRB staff member's review is about half completed. She has so far selected some 44 records totaling 123 pages to be included in the JFK collection. When the ARRB staff member's review is completed, the selected records will be copied and subjected first to a duplicate check by DA/OIM/JFK reviewers, then reviewed by those reviewers, then reviewed by HCS reviewers.

(U) We have been unable to locate any "operational diaries" by William Harvey.

CIA-IR-35 - Oswald related Information

(S) The surfacing of a report in the continuing Oswald 201 file attributed to IJDECANTER prompted the ARRB to request a review of that defector's 201 file. Certain such reporting records will be included in the JFK collection as records in Oswald's 201. A Board request for an updated search of records for Oswald related material generated some 128 hits, which were reviewed by Ms. Michelle Combs of the ARRB staff. Three records, selected by Ms. Combs and sanitized with her concurrence, were selected for inclusion in the JFK assassination records collection.

CIR-IR-36 - Handling of Cables in 1963

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 217

SECRET

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response to the ARRB staff's request for a brief explanation of how the Directorate of Operations processed cables in the 1963/1964 timeframe. We are unable to locate any Agency-wide definitive records on the subject for this time frame, and the information provided below is based solely on the memory of DO officers familiar with procedures in place at the time and in the specific offices in which they served.

(U) Each area division in the DO maintained and staffed its own registry. Although each registry was configured to meet each division's unique requirements, there were common functions performed by all the registries to include: collecting, sorting, and delivering of incoming cables; maintenance of incoming and outgoing cable "chronos;" collecting and delivering of incoming and outgoing pouch material; and the issuance and maintenance of "pseudo and alias" card files.

(U) On a daily basis, usually six days per week, each registry collected its incoming cable traffic from a central processing point, then called the Cable Secretariat, within the Office of Communications. The incoming cables were then sorted by registry personnel according to predefined guidelines. These guidelines were unique to each division and were frequently altered to meet changing operational requirements. Sorted cables were then delivered to specific operational/area desks. A "chrono" copy of each incoming cable was maintained, on a temporary basis, usually for 90 days, and the receiving office placed a copy into an operational file based upon subject or activity.

(U) Outgoing cables were created and coordinated by appropriate operational/area desks and usually released by the chief of the division or a designated releasing officer. "Released" cables were then hand delivered or sent by pneumatic tube system (a system long ago dismantled from the original Headquarters building) to Cable Secretariat for processing into the Agency's communication network. "Chrono" copies of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 218

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

outgoing cables were forwarded to the registry for a 90 day hold and the sending office placed a copy in the appropriate operational file.

(U) There was a centralized processing section for the directorate that received copies of the cables to review them and update the central index cards.

CIA-IR-37 – William Pawley

(U) The DO provided an unclassified response to the ARRB's request to review all files on William Pawley and any files on his possible connection with Cuban exile groups in the 1962-1963 time frame. The Agency's 201 file on Pawley consists of three volumes, the same as in the JFK sequestered collection, and November 1962 is the date of the last record indexed to his 201. However, the Agency holds operational files for the period 1963 to 1965 which related to Pawley. Those files were made available for review by the ARRB staff and they selected a number of documents for inclusion in the materials being processed for release to NARA.

Unnumbered Request -- Worldwide Query

(U) In March 1998 the ARRB asked "whether a worldwide query was sent out the day after the assassination for all case officers to query their sources for any information on the assassination and Oswald. Are or would all the answers be in the collection?"

(S) The following information has been identified:

A. A "book message," that is a message to all stations and bases, DIR 84608, dated 22 November 1963 (date/time group 222054Z) was sent. This message advised all stations and bases about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The message advised all to be "on alert." This cable is found in Oswald's 201 file, Box 1, Volume 3.

SUBJECT: JFK Declaration of Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr.

B. A "book cable," DIR 85133, dated 26 Nov. 1963 (date/time group 2623192) was sent. This message was sent "routine" but with ten addressees on a "prior-ity basis." The ten "priority" addressees were: Paris, Rome, Madrid, Copenhagen, Oslo, Helsinki, Brussels, The Hague, London, and Ottawa. This cable advised all stations and bases of the identity of the alleged assassin by name of Lee Harvey Oswald. This cable can be found in Oswald's 201 file, Box 1, Volume 4.

C. Neither of these two cables indicates that a "routing" coding was to be used to ensure that all responses, if any, would be classified to Oswald's 201 file.

8. (U) I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE FOREGOING IS TRUE AND CORRECT.

Executed in Langley, Virginia on this 2nd day of September 1998.

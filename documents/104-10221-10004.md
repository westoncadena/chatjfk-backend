ACTION REQUIRED: As stated.

Attached for both addressees are copies of a brief biographic sketch on Victor RICO Galan. As can be seen from the sketch, Headquarters knows something of his activities, but next to nothing about the man himself. During the discussion of the problem of RICO Galan at the recent CP Operations Seminar in Mexico City it was mentioned that both LICOOKY-1 and LIFANIL-9 were personally acquainted with him; perhaps these two sources could provide some impressions of RICO Galan that would flesh out this skeleton sketch.

24 February 1965

VICTOR RICO GALAN (201-336474)

1.  DPOB: 6 February 1928; El Ferrol, Spain. Subject, Spanish by birth, became a Mexican citizen by naturalization on 15 March 1949.

2.  CIVIL STATUS: Subject is married to Ingeborg DIENER do Rice.

3.  ADDRESS: Providencia 930, Mexico City, D. F. Telephone number as of September 1964: 23 07 92. This phone is registered in the name of his mother-in-law, Tilli PICHIER viuda de Diener, whose address is also Providencia 930.

4.  OCCUPATION: Writer for Siempre and Politica magazines in Mexico City; both are effective Communist-lining magazines and have large circulation.

5.  PHOTOGRAPH: Available in Subject's 201 file (date of photograph October 1963).

6.  POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS AND INCLINATIONS: As of 1962 Subject was the head of the National Press and Propaganda Committee of the National Liberation Movement (MLN) in Mexico City, a rabidly anti-U.S. and pro-Castro organization. Subject is close to Fidel Castro and company, and is considered as a Cuban "agent" (degree of Cuban control unknown). Subject was a founding member of the MIN. In an article in Siempre in March 1963 he advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the ideology of General Lazaro Cardenas, leftist former President of Mexico. This would have provided, in his belief, the Mexican left a political organization truly responsive to the radical tendencies of the 1910 revolution. This was necessary because the MLN, whose membership covers the spectrum of Mexican Communist Party to PRI, could not take open political stands without antagonizing some of the membership. The new party would have represented a "third position", socialism in internal affairs and independence of any bloc in international affairs. With a party such as this an ite political action arm, the MLR would have developed naturally into a broad national movement such as the FRAP in Chile. (Some specious reasoning here.)

7.  TRAVEL:

A) To Cuba:

1) July 1962 - return date unknown
2) 2 October 1962 - returned Mexico December 1962
3) 25 May 1963 - returned Mexico 22 June 1963

Ingeborg Diener de RICO Calan, Subject's wife, traveled from Mexico to Cuba in November 1962. Subject was at that time in Cuba.

8. PASSPORT: Subject formerly carried Mexican passport number 57115, with Cuban courtesy visas. On 9 September 1963 Subject was issued Mexican passport number 56341 (er 53641).

9. ACTIVITIES: The reason for the October 1962 trip to Cuba was ostensibly to gather material for a political biography of Fidel Castro. The May/ Juna 1963 trip was to interview Pidel Castro after his return from the Boviet Union. Subject claimed that he had spent eight deys with Fidel during that visit, five of those aboard ship.

On 24 October 1963 HYSAGR-1 in Panama City reported that Subjeet had received an operational scsigiment from Castro (during the May/June 1963 visit to Habana) on which to travel through Contral and South America. His aission was to persuade loftist parties to izmediately begin acts of sabotage and violence, and to try to maintain thesa in order to take pressure off Venezuela. Subject was also instructed to bring about better unity among competing leftist factions to ensure greater impact for their work. Subject did, in fact, contact many Communist Party and leftist leaders during his Central and South America travel during the period October 1963 - Jamary 196. Frez the (fragmentary) reporting on Subject frea October 1963 through January 1964 it appears that he did discuss the question of leftist unity.

10. In October 1964 the Guatemalan authorities captured a number of tape recordings from tho guerrillas in operations subsequent to a guerrilla attack on a garrison in Pansos, Alta Verapas. Included in those tapes was one made by RICO Qalan for delivery to the guerrillas. It consists mainly of an exhortation for unity (among the POT and the 13 November Group)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

and counsel against letting doetrino replace action. The tape clearly reveals RICO to be at once a very intellectual leftist who also has his feet planted quite firaly on the ground. His approach is pragantic, not theoretical. The text of the tape indicates that it was made sometime after February and before mid-October 1964.

11. There is little at hand to indicate what manner of man is RICO Galan. His 201 file reflects facts but not impressions. He apparently is known personally by LICOOKY-1 and LITAMIL-9 in Mexico City, and these two sources should be queried.

# TODAVIA, LA OSCURIDAD

Rico Galán, incomunicación.

Hasta el sábado 20, la situación fue muy confusa en tomo a las detenciones electuradas por la policia del DI - el viernes 12 - bajo los cargos de subversión y acopio de armas, entoncos aún no configururdon cuina delitos especthere. U paro del asunto a la Irocurarturia General de la Reparar y la consignación de esta d juez segundo do Distrito del DF on Materia Penal, puso en claro, por ejemplo cuántos y quiénes con exactamente los detenidos. Las versiones atabulan núme-roa variables de acusarlos, quienes por fin, unte el juez, resultaron 46 por lo que su roliere a los que permanecieron más de una semana en los sepiarca de la Jelatura de Policia.

A medida que pasaban los días -co-da jornada salpicada por un amplio bo-letin de prensa de la Jelatura de la Poli-cla- se lueron conociendo detalles, siem pre pasados por el tamiz de los órganos policiacos, para quienes su activided habla de lundarse en el mayor acopio do hechos y declaraciones. Se vio entonces que las tendencias y actividades expuestas incluso en las informaciones policiacas no eran igualmente graves ni reprimibles, en el mismo grado desde el momen-to en que 17 de los apresados quedaron en libertad el sábado 20; otros 20 serian juzgados por el único delito de conspiración, con derecho a obtener inmediatamente la libertad, mediante fianzas variables; y 9, los consignados por tres delitos: conspiración, incitación a la conspl-ración y acopio de arinas, quedarian presos a disposición del juez que dictaria el auto de formal prisión, sin el beneficio de la libertad provisional en ningún caso.

Las informaciones de la Policia resumkan las impugnaciones a la existencia de un grupo llamado Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo, que, en dos casas alquiladas -llamadas una "escuela Hidalgo", la otra "escuela Morelos", en las cuáles -decla- se hablaba de la organización de la lucha armada para el derrocamiento del gobierno. dó México. Nuestro colaborador Victor Rico Galán y el Lic. Raúl Ugal-de quien fue dirigente del Frento Electoral del Pueblo - gran saña-lados como los dirigentes y principales responsables. La policía habla-ba también de prácticus do tiro, y con akudo de su eficacia, daba cuen ta de que tenía en sus manos el asunto y a los participantea, desde hacia S mesos. A no pocos de los detenidos se les mencionaba como decla-rantes contra Rico Calán, al indicárselo por ellos como responsable principal. Incluso se dijo que la hermana de nuestro colaborador, la señora Ana Maria Rico Galán, había declarado contra éste inculpándo-lo do ser quien lo explicó el manejo de armas.

Un amparo interpuesto por el abogado Juan Manuel Gómez Gu-tiérrez, mediante el cual un juez dictó la suspensión provisional de los actos, determinando que los detenidos quedaran a su disponción embrolló momentáneamente las cosas desde el punto de vista juridico, por cuanto los retonka en los separan du la Jelaturq, adonde hubieron da coudir los funcionanos y actuarios de la Procuraduría Solo el de-sistimiento del amparo podia encaminar a los 9 consignados sin derecho a libertad provisional, y a los 20 que no hubieran presentado laa lanzas, a la cárcel preventiva de la ciudad.

El juez segundo de Datrito, Lic. Rafael Pérez Miraveta, con apoyo en by consignación y en las respectivan tipificaciones de delitoa hechon por la Procunturia General, comenzó a despachhar la tasa da decka-raciones preparatories. La mayoran de los indicados no aceptaron co-B

Ugakkia ha-bla invitado a nuestro colaborador Victor Rico Galán, a su hermana y a otras personas, a formar parte de caum discusiones que se hacian en las mencionadas "escuelas". Ugalde afirmó que el MRP es "una or-ganización licita, creada en ejercicio de derechos constitucionales irre-nunciables".

Nuestro colega Rico Galán se negó a declarar el sábado 20. No lo haría hasta que no pudiera hablar con su abogado, y le fuera total-mento levantada la incomunicación. Rico dijo: "He estado 8 dias in-comunicado, salvo algur.ca minutos en que por un amparo dictado por el juez primero de Distrito, se me permitió hablar con mi esposa, pero con un testigo, un agente de la Jefatura de Policía; por tanto, no estoy en condiciones de declarar hasta poder hablar con mis abogados". Victor as quejó también de haber estado 36 horas sin comer en un so-paro sin agua; de haber sido victina de presiones morales, como la detención de su hermano Fernando -enfermo del corazón- qulen, por cierto, estaba ya entre los 17 que hablan puesto on libertad. Eata comunicación de Rico Galán con el exterior produjo en 61 emociones: naturales, al conocer, por primera vez, qué otras personas estaban do-tenidas y por qué. Rico Galán no fue detenido en las "escueks" donde según la policia habla armas y una bomba, sino en el aeropuerto cuan-doiba a despedir a su hermano Femando, quien viajaba a Cuba, para renidir allt definitivamente.

El lunes 22 de agosto, loa consignados debian pasar a la cárcel preventiva. Al entrar el proceso en términos de mayor normalidori, Y cauces de ley, la opinión pública esperaba conocer mejor qué habla, on realidad, en el fondo de lo que fue considerario como una "conspi tución" por la policia, y hasta qué punto se ostaban o no viomdo do-rechon individuales y constitucionales.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.

SOURCE Mexican intellectual who is a personal friend of Victor Rico Galan,
with whom he disagrees politically. Source has reported infrequently
on Rico Galan's activities. The reported information was obtained
both from Mrs. Rico Galan and from Francisco Martinez de la Vega.

1. Francisco Martinez de la Vega, writer for Siempre, Mexican leftist
   magazine, said that Colonel Eduardo Estrada Ojeda, in the police
   headquarters where Victor Rico Galan and others were being held after
   their arrest on charges of subversion, had been instructed to permit
   Rico Galan to receive packages from his wife.

2. Elena Garro, writer, told Mrs. Rico Galan that she was going
   to speak to Minister of Interior Luis Echeverria to persuade
   him to ensure that Rico Galan would not be manhandled by the
   police during the interrogation.

3. She, also, expressed skepticism about the whole affair,
   saying that it was a farce and that she believed that many of
   those arrested with Victor had been paid to make the statements
   attributed to them.

Field Comment: An unsigned article titled "New Conspiracy?" appeared on
page 8 of Siempre. It presented briefly an account of the arrest of and
charges against Rico Galan; belittled what it termed the periodic
paroxysms of patriotism which seize the Mexican police and lead to such
arrests; then went on to suggest that Rico Galan, a political journalist
accustomed to expressing his ideas in signed articles, could hardly be
thought of as a conspirator. The article concluded with a plea for respect
both for Rico Galan's constitutional rights and for the rights of a free
journalism.

Headquarters Comment: This article appeared in issue no. 687, dated
24 August 1966, of Siempre.

1. Elena Garro, Mexican playwright and novelist, was formerly married
   to Octavio Paz Lozano, prominent Mexican poet.

SOURCE: Guatemalan professional man, former member of a guerrilla organization in Guatemala, who is believed to have good access to Guatemalan exiles iaMexico.

1. Rolando Collado Ardon, leader of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico and a member of the Guatemalan Communist Party (PGT - Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo) said that the arrest of Victor Rico Galan on charges of subversion was a good thing for the PGT. Collado was referring to Rico Galan's influence on Guatemalan guerrilla leader Marco Antonio Yon Sosa. According to Collado, Rico Galan prevented the PGT from persuading Yon Sosa to join the Party in 1963 because of Rico's Trotskyist interference and the aid he gave to Yon Sosa at the time.[^1]

2. Medical doctora Miguel Cruz Ruiz and Rolf Beiner Huebner, two of those arrested with Rico Calan, have been associated with Rico since early 1965. Both were very much involved in the medical doctors' strikes of late 1964 which continued into 1965. When the strikes were finally settled both Cruz Ruiz and Meiner Houbner vere dismissed from their jobs at the Social Security Hospital at Cuauhtemoc 330. They went directly to Rico Galan who put them to work, mainly writing medical articles for the magazine Sucesos for which Rico Galan worked. [^2]

3. Rico Galan sent both Cruz Ruiz and Meiner Huebner to Cuba in 1965 and both are well indoctrinated Communists.3 However, neither belongs to any Communist Party or organization: Both, as well as Dr. Jorge Vélez Trejo, also very active during the medical strikes, have traveled through Latin America making

REFERENCES

SOURCE Veteran and trusted member of the Popular Socialist Party who has close personal connections with ranking members of the Party. He has been a prolific reporter of reliable information. The reported information was obtained directly from leaders of both the PPS and the General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico, The substance of these persons' comments are believed to be accurately reported; their validity however cannot be assessed.

1. (Summary: Popular Socialist Party (PPS) attitudes toward the arrest of Victor Rico Galan and others on charges of conspiring against the Government remain unsympathetic and the Party intends to stay outside the entire matter although PPS Sec- retary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano may seize the oppor- tunity to strike back at some of his enemies by issuing a statement condemning the plans attributed to Rico Galan. Within theo Party there is considerable skepticism about the truth of the published charges. While several Party leaders do not doubt that there is some truth to the charges they aro quite convinced that there was no danger of imminent rebellion and that Mexican institutions stood in no peril from Rico Galan and his friends. Given the energy and efficiency with which the Mexican Government has dealt with less melodramatic threats in the past, one cannot but suspect that it is merely a tried and true Government Maneuver. Also, it is believed in the PP3 that police accounts of their role in the matter have been exaggerated to enhance the reputation of the police both with the President and with the public. The rumor that the Guatemalan Government may have asked the Mexican Government to silence Rico Galan because of his violent attacks against the nos Guatemalan administration is generally discounted wince the complaints of Guatemalan officials are certainly of no concern to Mexico.)

2.  Victor Rico Galan and his associates can expect neither sympathy nor help from the Popular Socialist Party (PPS - Partido Popular Socialista). Although no official decision has yet been made by the Party, PPS leaders who have commented unofficially on the matter have said that for the moment the Party will no doubt stay completely outside the whole affair, thus proving its total lack of interest in this type of revolutionary activity. It is of course possible that PPS Secretary General Vicente Lombardo Toledano will seize the opportunity to issue a statement condemning the entire affair as Trotskyist, criminal, and utopian. Lombardo may decide to use this opportunity to strike back at the National Liberation Movement (MLN - Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional) and others who have attacked him.

3.  Among leaders of both the PPS and the General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico (UGOCM - Union General de Obreros y Campesinos de Mexico), there is a certain skepticism about the truth of the matter as it has been presented in the press. It is probably true that arms and materials for manufacturing explosives were confiscated. It is probably true that indoctrination sessions on political and revolutionary matters probably were held in the houses where the arrests were made. And probably the group did have some kind of plan for action. But, it is simply not true that there was the slightest danger of immediate and formidable rebellion from Rico Galan and his friends.

4.  This latter conclusion is based on the fact that Rico Galan is no guerrilla leader. He is an aggressive intellectual, a radical, but he is not in jail for what he has done but for his ideas. As for Raul Ugalde Alvarez, named with Rico Galan as one of the leaders of the group, he has the reputation of being fuzzy-minded, a leftist adventurer and certainly neither brave nor dedicated. Further, and Rico Galan is well aware of this, popular support is essential to the success of rebellion. None exists. The peasants are divided. The workers are controlled by the Government, and the middle-class is content with the way things are. Also, there is the formidable precedent of Government action against any kind of rebellion, trade union, armed, and particularly any sort of activity which is Cuban-connected. The Government has always moved with energy, speed, and efficiency to combat such threats as, for example, during the Railway Workers Strike of 1959. Several leaders of that strike are still in jail and likely to remain there. Another example is the september 1965 attack on a military camp at Ciudad Madera, Chihuahua. While the Government did not feel that his incident posed any real threat to it, it did not want the bad international publicity, so vigilance was increased, activities of would-be guerrillas were blocked, some were bought off with money, others with promises and the matter was promptly and efficiently controlled.

5.  There no doubt is a degree of truth to police charges, but the melodramatic, almost childish character given to the Rico Galan movement, the lack of any proven connection between the movement and leftist/Communist organizations, Rico Galan's open and well-known connections with Guatemalan guerrilla leaders and his public support of the Cuban revolution, make it very hard to discount the suspicion that this is simply a Government maneuver. Also, while the police no doubt did confiscate arms and other materials, the suspicion exists that the police have inflated their role in order to make themselves look good both to the President and to public opinion.

6. There is even a rumor that because of Rico Galan's harsh attacks on the new Guatemalan administration, the Guatemalan Government asked the Mexican Government to deal with Rico Galan. This rumor however is regarded as rather ridiculous since the Mexican Government certainly cares nothing for the opinion of Guatemalan officials.

Field Comment: HMM-10,614 reported earlier PPS reaction to the arrests.

WITH OFFICIALS OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN MEXICO.

1. HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: ACCORDING TO PRESS ACCOUNTS, VICTOR RICO GALAN, A SPANISH-BORN JOURNALIST RESIDING IN MEXICO CITY, WAS ARRESTED BY THE MEXICAN POLICE ON 12 AUGUST WITH 27 MEN AND 5 WOMEN AND CHARGED WITH "CONSPIRACY ON A NATIONAL SCALE". THE GROUP WAS ALLEGED TO HAVE HELD MEETINGS TO PLAN SUBVERSIVE TACTICS AND ACTIVITIES AGAINST THE NATION'S INTERNAL SECURITY. POLICE ALSO CLAIMED THAT THE MEMBERS HAD BEEN IN RADIO CONTACT WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN CUBA. THE 17 AUGUST EDITION OF EL UNIVERSAL GRAFICO NOTED THAT THE POLICE WERE INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY

OF "FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT" IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT RICO GALAN WAS
READY TO BOARD A CUBANA FLIGHT WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED. FURTHER RE-
PORTS CLAIMED THAT 48 PERSONS WERE DETAINED AS A RESULT OF THE
ROUNDUP. FOR EARLIER REPORTING ON THIS CASE, SEE TDCS-314/10486-66,
20 AUGUST 1966, TDCS-314/10419-66, 18 AUGUST 1966, AND TDCS-
314/10347-66, 15 AUGUST 1966.

2. ON 18 AUGUST ABELARDO CURBELO PADRON, CUBAN CONSUL IN
   MEXICO CITY, SAID THAT THE SENDING OF AN OLD DC-4 AIRCRAFT TO
   MEXICO FROM CUBA ON 16 AUGUST WAS OSTENSIBLY A SPECIAL SERVICE
   PROVIDED FOR JOSEPHINE BAKER TO TRANSPORT HER AND HER 16 CHILDREN
   TO MEXICO. ACCORDING TO CURBELO, HOWEVER, THIS PLANE ALSO GAVE
   THE CUBANS AN EXCUSE FOR NOT EVACUATING THE MEXICANS IMPLICATED
   IN THE RICO GALAN CASE WHO WERE PRESSING THE CUBAN EMBASSY FOR
   SANCTUARY IN CUBA TO AVOID ARREST. CURBELO INDICATED THAT THE
   CUBANS WERE VERY FEARFUL FOR CUBAN-MEXICAN RELATIONS IN VIEW OF
   THE RICO GALAN CASE AND DID NOT WANT TO BE ACCUSED BY THE MEXICANS
   OF GRANTING ASYLUM TO GUILTY PARTIES.

3. ON 15 AUGUST JULIAN LOPEZ DIAZ, CUBAN PRESS AND CULTURAL
   ATTACHÉ, HAD ADVISED A FRIEND NOT TO TAKE THE 16 AUGUST FLANE TO
   CUBA BECAUSE THERE WERE GOING TO BE SEVERAL MEXICANS ABOARD TO
   ESCAPE ARREST IN THE RICO GALAN CASE. AS IT TURNED OUT, HOWEVER,

ONLY FIVE PERSONS FLEW TO CUBA IN THE DC-4 AND NO MEXICANS WERE AMONG THEM. (SOURCE COMMENT: IT IS VERY UNUSUAL FOR CUBANA TO CARRY ONLY FIVE PASSENGERS ON ITS MEXICO-TO-HAVANA RUN.) WHEN ASKED WHY HE DID NOT DO MORE IN CULTURAL PRESS WORK FOR CUBA, LOPEZ REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS ASSISTING THE REVOLUTIONARY FORCES IN MEXICO. (SOURCE COMMENT: LOPEZ IS PROBABLY A SECURITY OR INTELLIGENCE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE CUBAN EMBASSY, SINCE HE IS VERY CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND APPEARED TO FEEL THAT THE MEXICANS CONNECTED WITH THE CASE WHO HAD NOT YET BEEN ARRESTED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN PASSAGE TO CUBA.)

4. ON 12 AUGUST FERNANDO RICO GALAN, VICTOR'S BROTHER, WAS OBSERVED IN THE CUBANA OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE FOR A FLIGHT TO HAVANA. THE FLIGHT DID NOT COME TO MEXICO CITY THAT DAY AND FERNANDO WAS LATER ARRESTED IN THE ROUNDUP. ALSO ON 12 AUGUST ONE, NOEL BARRA ZENIL WAS OBSERVED ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE PASSAGE TO CUBA. (SOURCE COMMENT: BARRA IS A RABID COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY WHO IS CLOSE TO RICO GALAN AND UNTIL RECENTLY WAS A LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF HAVANA.) (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: A USUALLY RELIABLE SOURCE REPORTED THAT IN MAY 1956 ALVAR NOEL BARRA ZENIL WAS LISTED AMONG PERSONS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE PARTIDO OBRERO-CAMPESINO MEXICANO (POCM, MEXICAN WORKER-PEASANT PARTY), A SMALL MARXIST SPLINTER GROUP.

AT POZA RICA, VERACRUZ

REF: HKM-13,632
ACQ: MEXICO, MEXICO CITY (22 AUG 66) FIELD NO. HMM-13,624
SOURCE: MEXICAN SECURITY OFFICER WITH ACCESS TO INFORMATION
DERIVED FROM INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES. HIS
REPORTING IS BELIEVED TO BE RELIABLE.

1. PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF AN INVESTIGATION BY MEXICAN
   SECURITY OFFICIALS OF THE 14 AUGUST EXPLOSION AND FIRE IN THE
   PEMEX REFINERY AT POZA RICA, VERACRUZ, HAVE REVEALED NO EVIDENCE
   TO INDICATE WHO MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXPLOSION.
   INVESTIGATION IS HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT SECURITY PRE-
   CAUTIONS AT THE REFINERY ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT. AT THE
   TIME OF THE EXPLOSION ONLY ONE GATE GUARD AND TWO SOLDIERS
   WERE ON DUTY IN THE ENTIRE PLANT.

2. THE CONDITION OF THE SECTION OF THE GAS TRANSMISSION
   LINE WHERE THE FIRST EXPLOSION OCCURED INDICATES THAT THE
   LINE WAS RUPTURED BY AN OUTSIDE EXPLOSION SINCE THE EDGES OF
   THE PIPE AT THE POINT OF RUPTURE WERE TURNED INWARD.

3. THE EXPLOSION OCCURED AT A TIME WHEN MAXIMUM PROPERTY
   DAMAGE AND MINIMUM LOSS OF LIFE WERE ASSURED. (SOURCE COMMENT:
   HAD THE BLAST AND FIRE OCCURED DURING THE WORK WEEK IT IS PROBABLE
   THAT AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED PERSONS WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.)

4. (SOURCE COMMENT: THE CONDITION OF THE PIPE LINE AND
   THE TIMING OF THE EXPLOSION STRONGLY SUGGEST SABOTAGE. ALSO,
   THE DAMAGE IS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE THAN THE PRESS HAS INDICATED
   AND IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE MUCH LONGER TO GET THE REFINERY BACK
   IN OPERATION THAN HAS BEEN ESTIMATED. RESERVES ARE BEING USED
   NOW TO PREVENT A GASOLINE SHORTAGE.)

EXCEPT FOR STRAIGHT NEWS ACCOUNTS OF "DECLARACIONES" AND LEGAL INDICTMENTS OF RICO GALAN AND FILOW-CONSPIRATORS, VERY LITTLE EDITORIAL COMMENTARY HAS BEEN NOTED ON RICO GALAY CASE SINCE REF, INDICATING TIGHT LID IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT STILL IN EFFECT. WHAT LITTLE EDITOPIAL COMMENTARY HAS APPEARED HAS EXPRESSED EITHER MILD CONCERN OVER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF ARRESTESS (E.G., 24 AUGUST SIMEPRE EDITORIAL ARTICLE), OR HAS RELATED ALLEGED ALUSED CONSPIRACY TO LASGER SPECULATION ABOUT MEXICO AS TARGET FOR STEPPED-UP CASTRO AND/OR CHICOM SUBVERSION.

Victor Rico Galan was born 6 February 1928 at El Ferrel, Spain, and came to Mexico as a Spanish "niño" (year unknown). He became a Mexican citizen and is now a prominent leftist journalist for Siempre and Politica. He lives at Providencia 930, Mexico City. He is head of the National Press and Propaganda Committee of the Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLN). He was a member of the Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution and of the Periodistas Amigas de Cuba in 1961.

Victor Rico Galan is a close friend of Fidel Castro Ruz. He went to Cuba in October 1962 to write a political biography of Castro. He went to Cuba again in May 1963 and interviewed Castro in June 1963 upon the latter's return from the USSR.

Between mid-October and mid-December 1963, he traveled to Panaria, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Brazil and conferred with leading Communists and leftists in each of these countries. In early January 1964 he visited the Dominican Republic and on 28 January 1964 again traveled to Cuba, presumably to interview Fidel Castro who had just returned from another trip to the USSR.

In September 1964, Rico Galan had several contacts with Armando Hart Davalos, Cuban Minister of Education and Antonio Nuñez Jimenez, President of the Commission of the Academy of Sciences of Cuba, who were visiting in Mexico.

In November 1964, he published an interview he had with Guatemalan guerrilla leader Marco Antonio Yon Sosa.

Rico Galan has very frequent contact with Rogelio Rodriguez Lopez, Second Secretary of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico and identified member of the Cuban Intelligence Service (061). He is also in contact with Oldrich Novicky, Second Secretary and Press Attache of the Czech Embassy who is an intelligence officer, and with Ivan Gavrilovich Alferlev, Pravda correspondent in Mexico who is a Soviet intelligence officer.

Rico Galan, according to a number of unimpeachable sources, is a professional paid agent for the Cuban government. He has acted as a courier, carrying large sums of money to pro-Cuban groups in several Latin American countries. He supports the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City in its propaganda activities, often using Siempre magazine in this work. His principal assignment, however, is to act as


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 74

2. 
Fidel Castro's chief political subversion agent in Latin America. During a recent trip to Guatemala, for instance, he attempted to orient politically the split Communist factions striving to overthrow the Guatemalan Government. A tape recording exists of a speech he made which was later distributed to Guatemalan guerrillas. In the speech Rico Galon claimed he was speaking as an individual, rather than as a representative of the Cuban government. In fact, he was acting on behalf of Castro, as he was instructed to do by members of the Cuban intelligence service in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City, with whom he has been in very frequent contact for the past several years.

Attached find a copy of the tape recording mentioned above.

# SECRET

Victor Rico Galán's membership in the following organizations:

IZI - members subscribe to an active campaign to oust U.S. business interests from Mexico and all Latin America, and to fight against U.S. interests and influence in Mexico and throughout Latin America. Members support the Cuban revolution, the Mexican Government's policy of non-intervention and auto-determination and pledge themselves to participate in activities which will bring greater economic, personal and social freedom to the people of Mexico.

There is no indication (at least in public/official IZI documents) that the IZI or its members owe allegiance to any foreign power. It has, however, until 1965, been controlled and assisted by the Mexican Communist Party which gives active allegiance to the Soviet Union. The IZI and the other Communist groups with which Rico Galán has been associated, support Soviet foreign policy objectives, usually without any reservations.

The Mexican Journalists Friends of Cuba and the Committee for Solidarity with Cuba follow the same lines as the IZI - with emphasis placed on the distribution of propaganda glorifying the Cuban revolution, and advocating the Cuban Government as the ideal for all Latin American countries.

Mexicana-Cuban Institute of Cultural Relations - emphasizes exchange of cultural and scientific information, exhibits materials, artists, etc., always, of course, extolling glorious Cuba and urging Mexico to follow Cuba's lead.

Arnaldo Orfila Reynal:

His only known organizational affiliation is his membership in the Argentina Socialist Party.

One source reported that Orfila was a naturalized Mexican citizen - however we have no record of his having been granted Mexican citizenship, and as late as April 1968, he was reported by Cubana Airlines as an Argentine citizen. It is reported that Cubana lists their passengers by citizenship.

Mexican intellectual who is a personal friend of Victor Rico Galan, with whom he disagrees politically. Source has reported infrequently on Rico Galan's activities. The reported infor- mation was obtained both from Mrs. Rico Galan and from Francisco Martinez de la Vega.

1. According to Francisco Martinez de la Vega of the magazine Siempre, Colonel Eduardo Estrada Ojeda at Police Headquarters where Victor Rico Galan and others wore being held after their arrest on charges of subversion had been instructed to permit packages from Mrs. Rico Galan to be delivered to her husband.

2. Elena Garro, writer, told Mrs. Rico Galan that she was going to speak to Minister of Interior Luis Echeverria to try to get his to ensure that Rico Galan would not be manhandled by the police during the interrogation.

3. Miss Garro expressed a scepticism about the whole affair, saying that it was a farce and that she believed that many of those arrested with Victor had been paid to make the statements that they had.

Source Comment: On 17 August Francisco Galindo Ochoa, Press Secretary In The Presidencia, complimented Martinez de la Vera on the piece on Rico Galan's arrest which appeared in the most recent issue of Siempre.

Field Comment: A short, unsigned article titled New Conspiracy? appeared on page 8 of Siempre. It presented briefly an account of the arrest of and charges against Rico Galan; took a swipe at what it termed the periodic paroxysms of patriotism which seize the Mexican police; and then went on to suggest that

Rico Galan, a political journalist accustomed to expressing his ideas in signed articles, could hardly be thought of as a conspirator, and concluded by pleading for respect both for Rico Galan's constitutional rights and for the rights of a free journalism.

2. ACCORDING TO CARLOS SANCHEZ CARDENAS OF THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE DIRECTORATE OF THE PPS, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT A MAN LIKE RICO SALAN COULD BE THE LEADER OF A ARMED REPEL MOVEMENT. HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A MARICT INTELLECT JAL BELONGING TO NO PARTY WHO HAS CONFINED HIS BATTLES TO THE PAGES OF MAGAZINES LIKE POLITICA, SIEMPRE, AND SIKESOS.

TION MOVEMENT (MLM) AND BELONG TO THE RADICAL SECTOR OF THE MLN WHICH LANTS TO CONVERT THE GROUP INTO A MARXIST-LENINIST PRO- CASTRO POLITICAL PARTY.

5. SANCHEZ CARDENAS OFFERED THE OPINION THAT THOSE ARRESTED ARE OBVIOUSLY MORE IN TUNE WITH THE CHINESE THAN THE SOVIET VERSION OF MARXIST-LENINIST DOCTRINE. PICO SALAN AND POSSIBLY OTHERS HAVE MAINTAINED CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY AS WELL AS WITH THE SOVIET, POLISH, AND CZECHOSLOVAKIAN EMPASSIES. BECAUSE THEIR ALLEGED PROPOSALS FOR ARMED AND IMMEDIATE REBELLION ARE USELESS, PROVOCATIVE AND CRIMINAL THEY SHOULD BE CONDEMNED BY THE LEFT IN MEXICO BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT ONLY IMPERILED OTHER LEFTIST ORGANIZATIONS IN MEXICO BUT THEY HAVE ALSO ENDANGERED THE SOCIALIST BLOC EMBASSIES WITH WHOM THEY HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH. CONDITIONS IN MEXICO ARE NOT PROPER FOR LAUNCHING AN ARMED REBELLION. THE PROXIMITY OF THE UNITED STATES WOULD DOOM TO FAILURE ANY SUCH ATTEMPT. IN THE FACE OF SUCH NEGATIVE CONDITIONS ARMED REBELLION SHOULD BE CONDEMNED AS ANTI-MARXIST.

6. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE ABOVE STATEMENTS, SANCHEZ CARDENAS SAID THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT ARMED REBELLION WAS

1. PRESIDENT GUSTAVO DIAZ ORDAZ HAS ORDERED THAT PUBLICITY ON THE ARREST OF VICTOR RICO GALA*N AND SOME FORTY OTHER SUB- VERSIVES OF 13 AUGUST 1966 BE PLAYED DOWN AND THAT THE PRESS BE URGED TO EMPHASIZE THE DANGER DEVELOPED FROM THEIR IDEATIONS AND TO PLAY FOR A LONG TIME, (FIELD COMMENT:

3. THE TIMING OF THESE ARRESTS IS VERY FORTUITOUS SINCE IT PAVES THE WAY FOR THE INCLUSION OF A POLICY STATEMENT IN THE PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL REPORT TO THE NATION ON 1 SEPTEMBER. DIAZ ORDAZ WILL CITE THE ARRESTS TO SHOW THAT THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT WILL NOT TOLERATE SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES OR INTERFERENCE BY EXTREME LEFTISTS.

4. ALTHOUGH PROOF IS STILL LACKING, THERE IS SUSPICION ON THE PART OF OFFICIALS IN THE MINISTRY OF GOVERNMENT AND ELSEWHERE THAT THE EXPLOSION IN THE PEMEX REFINERY IN POZA RICA, VERACRUZ, WAS AN ACT OF SABOTAGE AND WAS CONNECTED WITH THE ARRESTS OF RICO-GALAN AND HIS GROUP.

5. (SOURCE COMMENT: IT IS HOPED THAT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THIS GROUP AND CUBA, PRIMARILY VIA RICO GALAN, CAN BE DISCOVERED TO WARRANT A WARNING FROM DIAZ ORDAZ TO CUBA AND TO THE LATIN AMERICAN SOLIDARITY ORGANIZATION.

1. Source of paragraphs 2 and 3: Latin American with good contacts among members of the staff of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. He has reported reliably for a number of years.

2. On 26 May 1966 Professor Juan Mascaro Neves, a Spanish national who had acquired *"Inmigrado"* status in Kexico and who had been active in connection with affairs of the Cuban Consulate in Tampico, was picked up by three unidentified men who requested that he show them his identification documents. There was no information available through official Mexican Government services in Tampico on the detention of Mascaro. Since it seemed possible that the detention was not the work of Mexican officials, the Cuban Embassy protested to the Mexican Foreign Office orally. The Embassy was later informed that Mascaro had been deported to Venezuela for violations of the Mexican immigration law

3. Mascaro was a key contact of Victorico Galan, Spanish-born Mexican Marxist journalist, during the latter's visit to Tampico and Ciudad Mante from 4-6 April 1966. Mascaro's wife, Carmen_Garcia de Mascaro, has also been a close contact of the Cubans in Tampico.

5. Mascaro Neves was picked up on 26 May by agents of the DFS (Direccion Federal de Seguridad) and was brought to Mexico City from Tampico. He was immediately deported to Venezuela. The basic reason for Mascaro's deportation was his close association with Rico Galan.

1. Source Comment: Mexican security officials are convinced that Rico Galan is a key Communist figure and that he is involved in plans to establish bands of guerrillas in the Mexican countryside.

SOURCE Mexican security officer with access to information derived from
investigative activities. His reporting is believed to be reliable.

1.  On 25 April 1966 the National Liberation Movement (MLN -
    Movimiento de Liberación Nacional) held a meeting in its
    offices at Republica do El Salvador No. 30-301 in observance
    of the Week of Solidarity with the Dominican Republic. Only
    about 35 persons attended the meeting which was chaired by
    Luis Cordova Ortiz and Guillermo Casteron Ita, in the absence
    of leftist Journalist Victor Rico Galan who could not attend
    because of illness.

2.  Cordova devoted his speech to a denunciation of the United
    States' "armed invasion" of the Dominican Republic, calling
    it an act which has aroused the indignation of the entire
    world. On behalf of the MLN he demanded the withdrawal of
    U.S. troops from that country.

3.  Guillermo Calderon spoke briefly about the U.S. presence in
    the Dominican Republic, but devoted the better part of his
    speech to a criticism of the visit to Mexico of President
    Johnson on 14 April 1966. He accused the Mexican and United
    States governments of having kept secret until the very last
    minute the fact of an official visit which was falsely described
    as a courtesy visit. The visit was made on the pretext
    of unveiling the Lincoln statue, he said, but the fact that
    President Johnson brought with him all the members of his
    cabinet and his principal advisors, notwithstanding their

preoccupation with problems in Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and elsewhere, proved that Johnson had come to deal with matters of great importance to him and to Mexican President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz. Or, he added, was it that Johnson had come to give instructions, or orders, to continue his policy of oppression of the people, in this instance Moxico.

4. Calderon criticized sharply the Mexican Government for its methods in organizing the elaborate reception for President Johnson. The system of hording together the populace is accomplished, among other means, through threats made by union leaders to workers that they will lose a day's pay or suffer other losses if they do not participate in welcoming ceremonics. Calderon denounced officials of the Ministry of Foreign Relations for having remained silent in the face of a proposal by Secretary of State Dean Rusk for the creation of an international police force "the type of security force that has in the past protected countries from North American aggression".

5. Again on 28 April the MLN hold a meeting in observance of Dominican Week, this one attended by approximately twenty- five persons. It was announced at the last moment that the journalist Alberto Domingo, who was to have attended tho meeting, would not be present because of a more pressing engagement. In his absence Armando Castillejos Ortiz. and the poctoss Norma Carrasco improvised a program. Castillejos expressed regret that the MLN does not possess adoqunto publishing facilities to keep the Mexican public informed of the existing situation in the Dominican Republic. Ho recommended that those present take advantage of every oppor- tunity, in their places of work and at gatherings elsewhere, to disseminate by word of mouth the facts of North American domination over the weaker nations of the world. He noted that ninety percont of the citizens of the United States are not in accord with U.S. foreign policy.

6. Norma Carrasco's contribution to the mecting consisted of the reading of pootry which she had composed depicting the United States' invasion of the Dominican Republic.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE

SOURCE: Guatemalan professional man, former member of a guerrilla group in Guatemala who is living in exile in Mexico. He is believed to have good access to the Guatemalan exile community.

Victor Rico Galan, leftist journalist who writes for both Siempre and Politica, is planning to visit Guatemala clandestinely to investigate the disappearance of Victor Manuel Gutierrez Corbin, Guatemalan Communist Party (ICT) leader of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico, who returned to Guatemala in late February.

Field Comment: TDCS-314/03186-66 reported that Gutierrez Garbin and three other Guatemalan leftists were arrested and executed by the Guatemalan authorities on 6 March 1966.

Source Comment: Rico Galan could only enter Guatemala illegally since he was declared *persona non grata* by the Guatemalan Government in 1963 after he visited the country to interview President Peralta. While there, he also managed to talk with Marco Antonio Yon Sosa, guerrilla leader. Upon his return to Mexico, Rico Galan wrote articles favorable to the rebels and most unflattering to the Peralta government. Rico Galan's interview with Yon Sosa was arranged through Adolfo Mijangos Lopez who is now living in exile in Mexico.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.

SOURCE: Guatemalan professional man, former member of a guerrilla group in Guatemala who is living in exile in Mexico. He is believed to have good access to the Guatemalan exile community.

Victor Rico Calan, leftist journalist who writes for both *Siempre* and *Politica*, reportedly is planning to visit Guatemala clandestinely to investigate the disappearance of Victor Manuel Gutierrez Carvin, Guatemalan Communist Party (PCT) leader of the Guatemalan exile community in Mexico who returned to Guatemala in late February.

Field Comment: HGG-4148 reported that Gutierrez Carbin and three other Guatemalan leftists were arrested and executed by the Guatemalan authorities on 8 March 1966.

Source Comment: Rico Galan could only enter Guatemala illegally since he was declared persona non grata by the Guatemalan Government in 1963 after he visited the country to interview President Peralta. While in Guatemala at that time he also managed to talk with I'arco Antonio Yon Sosa, guerrilla leader. Upon his return to Mexico, Rico Galan wrote articles favorable to the rebels and most unflattering to the Peralta government. Rico Galan's interview with Yon Sosa was arranged through Adolfo Mijango Lopez who is now living in exile in Mexico.

TO: Chief, WHD

INFO: Chief of Station, Guatemala City

FROM: Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT: Press Expose of Victor Rico Galan's Connection with Yon Sosa

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

1.  On 13 January 1966 a Mexico City newspaper, *El Heraldo*, published an article which cited a taped speech by Victor Rico Galan to Yon Sosa's guerrillas as evidence of Rico Galan's efforts to undermine the January 1966 visit of Mexican President Diaz Ordaz to Guatemala. A copy of this article is attached. The taped speech mentioned in the article is obviously that which Guatemalan authorities captured from Yon Sosa's guerrillas in October 1964 following a guerrilla attack on a Guatemalan military garrison. This tape was subsequently made available to KUBARK and was passed via the Guatemala Station to Mexico City Station for possible exploitation in Mexico. The content of the taped speech was later passed to President Diaz Ordaz by COS, Mexico City, with a view to stimulating pressure toward Rico Galan's expulsion from Mexico as an undesirable alien. How *El Heraldo* obtained or got word of the taped speech is not known. Since the *El Heraldo* article was pegged to the current trip to Guatemala of President Diaz Ordaz, it is very probable that the expose was stimulated directly by the Presidency, in line with a COM campaign to neutralize all existing and potential opposition locally to the Presidential trip.

2.  In a sharp rebuttal in the 26 January 1966 issue of the prominent Mexican leftist magazine *Siempre*, for which he writes regularly, Victor Rico Galan

denounces the *El Heraldo* accusations against him, denies any involvement on his part in subversive activities in Quatemala, attacks Ouatemalan President Peralta Azurdia as weak and fearful about his personal safety, and insists (quits correctly) that the speech he taped for delivery to Yon Sosa's guerrillas in October 1964 could not possibly have had anything to do with President Dias Ordas' trip in January 1966. A copy of the Rico Galan *Siempre* article is attached.

3.  At this stage the Station has no additional information on the origin or purpose of the *El Heraldo* attack on Victor Rico Galan. As and if such information develops through Station governmental contacts, the Station will advise addressees accordingly.

# POR VICTOR RICO GALAN

Sr Joss Pagée Liergo.
Director de SILMPRE
Admirado y Tengo home a un asunto
que me concierne personalmente, y uso
por ello el estilo epistolar. Como el asun-
to invoicta cosas que le importan al pals.
confia en que esta curta cor de interés
público, aunque para seguir un orden lo
gico me vea obligado a empezar por el
aspecto personal que hay en él.

Como usted sabo, El Heraldo de Méxi
co publicó el pasado dia 13 un cintillo que
decía "Fracasó la conjura comunista".
bajo, el cual se afirmaba que los guerri-
lleros guatemaltecos, en connivencia con
malos mexicanos, preparatan una alga-
rada o atentado esto no se especifica
ba- contra el Presidente Díaz Ordaz, con motivo de su viaje a Guate
mula Según la nota "informativa", que llevaba las misteriosas siglas
SNG (Servicio de Noticias de Guatemala?), el principal agente en esa
conjura sería yo, y como prueba se ofrecia la supuesta versión taqui-
gráfica de una cinta magnetofónica grabada por mí. Como existió, en
efecto, una cinta que yo grabé, y como en el "pastiche" publicado por
Heraldo se utilizam frases que pronuncié realmente, creo necesario
explicar la historia de todo ello.

Visité por primera vez Guatemala en octubre de 1963. En el número
de SIEMPRE! del 30 de ese mes y año, apareció publicada una entrevis-
ta mía con el coronel Enrique Peralta Azurdia, que se iniciaba con esta
descripción de su persona: " coronel Enrique Peralta Azurdia, "hom-
bre fuerte" de Guatemala, no da de ninguna manera la impresión de ser
fuerte. Por el contrario, es oscuro, de hablar premioso, con una cons-
tante actitud tímida y sin brillantez alguna. No tieno ere tono decidido
de los militares guatemaltecos que, digan cosas inteligentes o tentas, lo
hacen con un énfasis de cuestión sancionada. En los pocos minutos de
conversación con él, mo expliqué muy bien por qué pese a mi insis-.
tencia en contrario- nooptó sólo contestar mis preguntas por escrito.
La transacción final conciatió en que, una vez satisfecito el cuestionario
en esa forma, hablaríamos brevemente en su despacho, sobre todo con
el objeto de obtener una fotografia".

Esa discreta sugerencia de su tartanudez mental enfureció al coro-
nel. Y más aun, cuanto que en el mismo número de SIEMPRE! apareció
otra entrevista, también mia, con el entonces líder del movimiento gue
rrillero guatemalteco. El coronel Peralta Azurdia le dijo a un colega
chileno que lo entrevisto díos después que yo, que se vengoria de mi
donde quiera que me encontrase. ¡Y me imagino, no sin humor, el co-
raje que debe haber hecho cuando el colega chileno publicó su propio
reportaje... y coincidió conmigo en lo de la tartamuciez mental del se
ñor coronel!

Lo cierto es que el hombre intentó en reiteradas ocasiones cumplir
su promesa. Con motivo de su informe de gobierno, transmitido por ra
dio y televisión a toda Guatemala, me acusó de haber ido a ese país a
organizar "grupos de choque", y la AP y la UPi se encargaron de difun
dir la noticia, que la patriota, nacionalista y solidaria prensa mexicana
publicó profusamente. El coronel "se vengaba", y yo callé por no dar
importancia a la irritación de un personaje tan menor, irritación que,
por otra parte, me explicaba perlectamente.

Regresé a Guatemala un año después, precisamente en octubre
de 1964. Y. ofectivamerte, grabé un mensaje en cinta magnetofónica,
destinados a varios guerrilleros a los que no pude ver Neda tenia de
misterioso ese mensaje. Contenia un saludo, algunas apreciaciones 30-
bre el movimiento guerrillero hechas sobre el terreno por el observador.
por al periodista, y noticias para los que tenian familiares en México Ni
una zola palabra que luera necesario ocultar, ni una scia idea que no
haya publicado, no una, sino mil veces. ¿Acaso es un misterio mi sol..
jaridcal abierta y pública con quienes luchan por la libertad de su pa
tria? Mucho menos que misterio es delito, y yo me enor jullezco de esa
solidaridad

Lo cierto es, sin embargo, que est ciunta no llegó a sus ciestinata-
rios, porque tue capturada por el esercito guatemalteco Y of coronel
Porulta Azurder encontro en ella la toracula perfecta para una serie do
amaniobras que por un lod satalocan su me alo hoan my por

να pero no tenica, ni mucho menos Aintes habetumores (Au
v chimtajes contro muchas persongs, akis que se acusaba de D
cionadas en ka cinta y de colaborar conmigo en mis tenebrosas con
raciones En mayo de 1965, el diario guatemalteco Pronca Libre el de
mayor circulación en su puis hizo publica urms de coas "versiones".
De donde la habla obtenide? De un boletin malo por la china de
prenen del coronel Peralta Azurdia Y esa version tenia por chho
justificar la expulsión entonces rociente
del distinguido intelectual
y politico guatemalteco Francisco Villagrán Kramer, mencionado en ka
canta, lo cual era "prueba" de que conspiraba conmigo
¿Y por que sólo Prensa Libre publicó la versión? Pues por la razen
sumple de que provenia de un boletin olicial, y los otros periodicos de
Guatemala to negaron a aceptario si no se les permitia oir la tamasa
cinta. Y claro que no se les permitió Bajo una dictadura militar, los p
riódicos guatemaltecos tuvieron más ética profesional que Heraido
en un régimen de libertad de prensa. Pero asi son las cosas. Y algo que
es también importante hacer notar: Prensa Libre, kun olicialista que aco
gió la sucia calumnia, es el periódico que ha hecho la campaña má
gresera y negativa contra la visita del Presidente Diaz Ordaz a Guate
mala.

La "versión" de El Heraldo tiene por objeto acusarme, a mi y a
otras personas, de conspirar para echar a perder la visita del Presidente
Diaz Ordaz a Guatemala Yo fui a ese país por última vez -repito-
en octubre de 1964, cuando el licenciado Díaz Ordaz era Presidente
Electo ¿Cómo iba a saber que se proponia visitar Guatemala? ¿Cómo
iba a hablar de los asaltantes del cuartel de Ciudad Modera, en Chihua
hua, si eso sucedió a fines de 1965, y en octubre de 1964 nada sucedia
en Chihuahua? Eso, para mencionar sólo dos de las más abultadas tal.
sedades de la "versión" Se utilizan unas cuantas frases auténticas, y se
edcba una supuesta grabación para cada caso.. Sencillo y sin problemas.

Pero, además, el coronel Peralta Azurdia se propone otra cosa can
la "versión" de El Heraldo. Se propone justificer las extremadas pre-
ccuciones policicons que tomó para preservar su vida no la del Pre
sidente Díaz Ordaz- y la mala impresión que eso, y la falta de asisten
cia popular a la recepción, tuvo que causar al huésped y a su comitivta
Pose a que la tartamudez mental del coronel Percita Azurdia y la de sus
claboradores mexicanos on ol sucio adobo de la enta ne les permitis
siquiera solacionar beta con el viaju premdenaal, is noticia termina di
ciendo: "Por todo osto (¿por quét), el gobierno de Guatemala creyó per
tinente tomar todas las medidas necочаткs que garantizaron la segu
ridad del mandatario mexicana y do los miembros de su comitiva, da
rante su visita a nuestra nación".

Pero la verdad es que tales precauciones se tomaron para garanti-
zar la seguridad del coronel Peralta Azurdia -esa si muy amenazada--.
y no la dol Presidente Diaz Ordaz, contra el cual no tenía nada el pueblo
de Guatemala, y al que sólo los periódicos reaccionarios en particukar
Prensa Libro atacaron Tan es así, que si bien en la capital el Presi
dente mexicano fue encerrado en un automóvil blindado para prote
ger a Peralta Azurdia, y si bien en la capital acudió poco público
--para no aplaudis a Peralta Azurdia-, en la Antigua, a donde el licen-
ciado Díaz Ordaz fue solo, si hubo recepción popular entusiasta y se
braron las precauciones policiacas. Claro, no estaba Peralta Azurdia!

Y, en relación con esto, hay algo que el público mexicuno debe
zaber. La Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala la considero seria
mento la idea de otcrgarle al Presidente Diaz Ordaz el grado de doctor
honoris causa. El casunto se debatió extrcoficialmente en el Consejo Uni
versitario, y varios maestros propusieron la idea, porque significaba el
reconocimiento a un mandatario civil y universitano, e indirectamente
una boletaria a les gontas de uniforme que gobiernan Guatemala Y ies
consejeros alumnos estuvieron de acuerdo en que la tendencia era bue
na, pero objetaron el propósito por una sola razón: porque, por motivos
de protocolo, la Universiad so vería obligada a invitar y recibir en su
recinto al coronel Peraita Azurdia En tal caso -dijeron los estudian
tea no acudirian. Y, ante esto peligro, que desvirtuaba el verdadero
objetivo politico del proyecto, la Univerastad no clergé el grada. Eata
ckro que no lo otorga par una solu razón por no recibir a Peralta Azur

Notes for
A Portrait of a Castro-Communist
Agent

Victor Rico Galan was born 6 February 1928 in El Ferrol, Spain. He is Spanish by birth, bocame a Mexican citizen by naturalization in March 1949. He is married to Ingeborg Diener de Rico Galan, born 11 May 1929 in Med co City. He residos at Ernestina Larrainsar 19-1B, Col. del Valle in Mexico City. He writes for both *Stompro*, Mexico City leftist news-weekly, and *Politica*, pro-Communist bi-weekly newsmagazino.

VRG reportedly talked to Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in 1961 regarding the formation of the *Movimiento de Liberacion Nacional (MLM)* in Mexico. With their approval ho became one of the founding members of the MLN and later headed the MLN Press and Propaganda Committee. In a speech to the MLN in April 1962 he stated, "The government must be made to understand that only the people have the right to violence." (This was in reference to the Mexican government repression of the Communist Party and ite arrest of David Alvaro Siquioros.)

In an article in *Siempre* in March 1963 VRG advocated the formation of a new political party reflecting the ideology of General Lazaro Cardenas, former President of Mexico. VRG said this new political party was needed to truly represent the radical tendencies of the 1910 revolution. VRC conceived this new party as the political arm of the recently-formed MLN, which could thus develop into a bread national pro-Communist movement like the FRAP in Chile.

VRG has always been very close and sympathotic to the Castro-Cuban revolution. In 1961 he was a member of the *Periollstas Mexicanos Amigos da Cube*. Also in 1961 he was reported to be a member of the *Committee for Solidarity with the Cuban Revolution*. In March 1962 ha was reportedly a member of a group of four pro-Castroites who made an abortive physical attack on Emilio Uranga, writer for *Stompro* who has written anti-Castro fiems. As the group converged on Uranga other members of the *Stompre* stali intervened and the matter was settled without violence.

From October to December 1962 VRG was in Cuba, as a correspondent for *Sigmpre* and also reportedly to gather material for a political biography


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 124

of Fidel Castro. In an article written for Siempre while he was in Cuba
(Siempre 31 Oct 62) he extols the great Cuban revolution and the advantages
Castroism has brought to the lower classes. In a later article (Siempre
14 Nov 62) he attacks the Soviet Union and Khrushchev for their weakness during
the Cuban missile crisis. He refers to Fidel Castro as being the vanguard of
the revolution against Colonialiem.

From late. May to mid June 1968 VRG was again in Cuba, this time to
interview Fidel Castro following the latter's return from the Soviet Union.
VRG reportedly spent 8 days with Fidel Castro, five of thein aboard the Cuban
leader's yacht, and also interviewed other Cuban leaders, including Blas Roca,
Secretary-General of the Partido Socialista Popular (PSP Cuban Communist
Party); Ernesto "Che" Guevara Serna, Minister of Industries; Oswaldo
Dorticos Torrado, Cuban President; and Raul Roa Garcia, Minister of Foreign
Relations,

It was during this May-June 1963 contact with Fidel Castro and other Cuban
leaders that VRG received a major operational assignment. He was given the
mission of traveling through Central and South America to contact local
Communist and guerrilla leaders. His job was to persuade these groups to begin
campaigns of violence and terror immediately in order to take the pressure off-
the FALN in Venesuela, whose program of terror, heavily subsidized by Castro,
was beginning to run into increased resistance from the Venezuelan government
forces. On this trip VRG also had the mission of bringing about greater unity
among the various Communist and terroristic groups.

In late 1963 VRG undertook his assigned mission. He traveled to Panama,
Guatemala, Costa Rica, Venesuela, Nicaragua and Brasil and contacted koy
Commandets in each of theee countries.

Among the Communist leaders which VRG contacted on this trip were
Hugo Victor, President of the Partido del Pueblo (PDP People's Party,
a Communist group) and David Turner, a leader of the Yanguard of National
Action (VAN a pro-Cuban, radical revolutionary organisation) in Panama;
Gones Ayay, a guerrilla leader in Cuatemala; and Francisco Juliao, the
rovolutionary peasant leader, in Brazil.

In Nicaragua VRC mot several times with Alvaro Ramiren Conzalen,
Secretary General of the Movilizacion Republicana (MR Coaununist Political
Freny who was also a member of the Central Committee of the Partido Socialin
in Nicaragua (PSN), the Nicaraguan Communist Party. VRC's visit with


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 125

Ramirez was given considerable radio and press publicity in Nicaragua. The pross referred to "secret meetings" in VRG's hotel room between Ramires and VRG. Ramires answered by writing letters to the newspapers, saying he met VRG quite openly in his office and that VRG had called on him because he (VRG) was a legitimate journalist who was seeking interviews with various political figures. On 24 October Ramirez was interviewed on radio and finally reluctantly admitted that he had gone to VRG's hotel room. He said his purpose in going there was to take VRG to his (Ramirez's) office.

In Panama VRG stayed at the Hotel International. While in Panama he visited US installations and was seen taking many pictures. His talks with Hugo Victor and David Turner were aimed at getting the VAN and the PDF to resolve their differences and to unite. Turner briefed VRG on VAN's preparations to establish an armed movement in Panama, Victor, on the other hand, spurned VRG's to unify the two groups.

Following this trip in late 1963, VRG returned to Cuba (in January 1964) and visited Fidel Castro again and to report on the results of his contacts with Central and Latin American Communist leaders.

In late March 1965 VRG (with his wife) again traveled to Cuba to report to Cuban leaders. He returned to Mexico in early April 1965.

In May 1964 VRG was invited to visit Red China, ostensibly as a guest of the All-China Journalists Association, which indicated it would be willing to pay all costs, including transportation. Because of other pressing work in connection with hió assignments on behalf of Castro, VRG did not accept this invitation.

Over the years 1961 to 1965 VRG's contacts with the Cuban Enibassy in Mexico City have increased steadily. He meets frequently and regularly with various officials of the Cuban Embassy, usually at his home, at the Siempre offices or at the homes of the Cuban officials in Mexico City.

His most frequent contact is with Manuel Eugenio Vega Perez, Third Secretary of the Cuban Embassy and chief representative of the Dirrecion General da Inteligencia (DGI- Cuban Intelligence Service) in Mexico. Obese and outwardly jolly, Vega Peres was the driver of a beer truck in Havana prior to the Cuban Reolution which launched him on his intelligence cargar.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 126

-4-

Another VRG Cuban intelligence contact is Ramon Sinobas Casado, Counselor of the Cuban Embassy. Sinobas is Voga's assistant in handling" VRG. It is apparent that these contacts are primarily for the purpose of channeling VRG's reports and instructions to and from Cuba. In the course of his work as an agent for Castro and the DGI, VRG is known to have acted as a courier, carrying material and large sums of money to pro-Cuban groups in Central and Latin American countries.

In October 1964 VRG received another important assignment from his Cuban mastera. VRG was requested to travel to Guatemala to make a personal survey of the strength and weaknesses of Marco Antonio Yon Soea's guerrilla forces and to lay the basis for a more energetic implementation in Guatemala of the tactical principles for guerrilla warfare laid down by "Che" Guevara. This was, in effect, a follow-up to his earlier visit to Yon Sosa during his swing through Contral American countries in late 1963. At that time, VRG attempted to persuade Yon Sosa to align himself more closely with Castro's objectives in Latin America. The results of this visit to Guatemala were written up by VRG in a special report to Castro, VRG's conclusions at that time were not completely favorable to Castro.

Yon Sosa is known to be a forceful and independent querrilla leader who prides himself on his ability to maintain himself and his followers independently of ideological guidance from either Havana, Paking or Moscow, although he is quite willing to accept arms and financial support from any of these Communist capitals. In the past Castro's efforts to bring Yon Sosa to heel have bean thwarted mainly by the influence the Chinese Communists have been able to exert over the Guatemalan guerrilla leader. In addition to the direct aid provided by Peking to Yon Sosa and his guerrillas in Northeastern Guatomala, there is the fact of Yon Sosa'a Chinese background (Yon Sosa's father was Chinese) which has served to the him emotionally to the Red Chinese.

It was the continuing recalcitrant attitude of Yon Sowa which apparently prompted VRG's second mission to Guatemala in October of 1964. VRG was instructed not only to talk to Yon Sosa but also to try to influence Yon Sosa's guerrilla forces directly in line with Castro's objectives. In addition to prepared material which VRG used for locturing the guerrillas he brought with him special propaganda ilma for indoctrination purposes.

In late October 1964 the Guatemalan authorities captured a number of tape recordings from Yon Sosa's guerrillas following a guerrilla attack on a government

garrison. Included in these tapes was one made by VRG for delivery to the guerrillas during his carly October visit with them. A copy of this tape is attached. The tape consists mainly of an exhortation by VRG for unity (between the *Partido Guatemalteco del Trabajo* (PGT) and the 13 November Group) and a plea not to permit ideological arguments to replace action. In this speech VRG reveals himself to be a hard-headed revolutionary activist, not merely an intellectual loftist. His approach to revolution is completely practical, not the -oretical.

To cover hie mission as a Castro political action agent to Yon Sosa, VRG later published an "interview" with the latter (in *Siempre* No. 593, 4 November 1964).

VRG's involvement in the recent Dominican crisis is the latest example of his work on behalf of Castro. In early January 1964 VRG travelled to Santo Domingo, returning a week later to Mexico. Ostensibly this trip was to report on Dominican Republic affairs for *Siempre*, Actually this was merely a cover for a Communist propaganda assignment. Shortly after VRG left Santo Domingo, thousands of copies of a pro-Caatro brochure, entitled "*glempre visita la Dominicana*" and signed VRG, were distributed among Communists and Communist sympathizers in the Dominican Repablic. A copy of this brochure is attached..

During his January 1964 trip VRG contacted both the *Moviraiento Popular Dominicano (MPD)*, a terroristic revolutionary Marxist-Leninist and strong pro-Chicom group, and the 14th of June Movement, the *Agrupacion Politica Catorce de Junio (APCJ)*, a militant, revolutionary pro-Castro group. His contact with the MPD resulted in his furnishing material to the subversive MPD publication, *Libertad*, But his principal contact, ons that developed rapidly into a very active relationship in the period preceding the Dominican crisis, was with Juan B. Majia, leader of the AFCI. These two have maintained close and frequent contact over the past year. During the Dominican crisis VRG served as à relay point for material and instructions from Cuba to the APCJ and also acted as a reporting channel from Mejia to the DGI and the APCJ's Castro-Cuban laadership in Cuba.

As in previous operations of this kind, VRG cloaked his relationship with Mejia under a journalistic cover, An "interview" he conducted with Mejia appeared in the 2 May 1965 issue of the Cuban newspaper *Hoy*. A copy of the text of that article is attached.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 128

In mid-May 1965 a gaffe by Mejia's and VRG's Cuban superiors exposed the Mejia-VRG-Cuba channel publicly. In an article carried by Porto Alegre (Brazil) newspaper *Correio do Povo* on 20 May, datelined New York 19 May by Louis Wisniser, a Radio Havana broadcast of 18 May was reported to have mentioned a declaration by Juan Mojia sent from Santo Domingo to VRG in Mexico, who then sent the declaration to Radio Havana. After citing this channel by which it received the Mejia statement, Radio Havana proceeded to broadcast the following excerpts from the declaration: "Numerous leaders of the 14 June Party have disappeared but I (Mejia) know that they are now in the mountains leading guerrillas. The 14 June Party has control of the situation in Santo Domingo." The *Correio do Povo* noted editorially that the Radio Havana broadcast seems to negate the Castro effort to deny that the 14th June Movement in the Dominican Republic is tied to him. The article concludes by noting that Mejia was one of the 58 Communists listed by the Americans, and that this confession by Havana pats new light on the question of American intervention in the Dominican Republic. Not noted in the article is the fact that VIRG's role as an intermediary between Mojla and Castro is clanrly exposed by the Radio Havana broadcast. A copy of the *Corrado do Povo* article is attached.

When the Dominican rebellion erupted VRG began to agitate with the *Sigmpre* staff for outright and total support to the pro-Castro forces in the rabel camp. These offorts began to bear fruit when VRG was allowed to personally brief and dispatch a *Siempre* correspondant photographer team to the Dominican Republic in early May 1965 to report on the crisis. The correspondent waa Luis Suarez Lopoz; the photographer was Lais Rodrigo Moya Morano. The resulting articles in *Siempre* produced by this VRG-Suarez-dloya team ware violently anti-US and pro-Castro Communist in their interpretation of the crisis so much so that they apparently touched off a bitter dispute between VRG and Jose Pagan Mergo, *Siempre* director, who prefers to stick to the traditional *Siempre* role of a pseudo-independant outlet for a variety of leftist causes. VRG's efforts to reorient *Siempre* along more militant pro-Communist lines has long been known in journalistic circles in Mexico and the Suarez-Moya incident appeara to have precipitated an open fight between the two. VRC is apparently aiming for a showdown with Pages Liergo over this fague, since several *Siempre* writers are known to la ve been individually approached by VRC over the past woeks to enlist their support against the present *Siempre* editorial policy, which VRG regards as too "opportunistic.'

A. RICO TO COCCIOLI. LATTER STATED THAT ORENGO (PHONETIC-PRESUMABLY SARLER ORENGO OF REF) RECEIVED TELEGRAM FROM ACHIETIERI (POSSIBLY AGET CO.) YESTERDAY AUTHORIZING AND PRESSURING HIM TO GO TO CUBA TO "PRESENT THIS MATTER... IN THIS QUESTION IN WHICH YOU ARE HELPING US, I WOULD LIKE YOU (RICO) TO GET MAXIMUM MORAL BENEFIT.

ORENGO NEEDS A VISA; HE IS APOLITICAL, ON NEITHER SIDE. HE WILL NEED A VISA TO GO TO TALK TO WHOMEVER YOU SAY". COCCIOLI WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ORENGO TALK TO ALEJO CARPENTIER BUT "THIS IS SIMPLY A POLITICAL QUESTION". RICO SAYS HE TOOK UP THIS MATTER AND "THEY TOLD ME THAT IN CASE THIS MAN INSISTS IN THIS MATTER I SHOULD PUT HIM IN CONTACT WITH THE AMBASSADORO. HE IS STAYING AT HOTEL MARIA CRISTINA.

COCCIOLI SAYS HE IS A VERY GOOD FRIEND, HAS BEEN ONE FOR MANY YEARS. COCCIOLI WANTS TO GIVE HIM (ORENGO) PRECISE INSTRUCTIONS, AS RICO SHOULD INDICATE, ALSO THAT THE CASA SCHET (PHONETIC-POSSIBLY AGET) WOULD BE INTERESTED FOR YOU TO MAKE THE BOOK". RICO SAYS

   BECAUSE COCCIOLI COULD EXPLAIN TO AMBASSADOR SINCERELY WHAT IS BEHIND
   ALL THIS. THIS MAN IS TECHNICAL ATTACHE OF THE DIRECTION GENERAL

En escrito de 20 de abril del año en curso,
dirigido al C. Procurador General de la Republica y turnado
a esta Dependencia el 5 de octubre anterior, se dice lo si-
guiente:

Tengo la magnitud de los problemas naciona-
les, no ha hecho pesar su sernidad e inteliento politica, y
ha demostrado que, independientemente del ejercicio de su calidad
moral, y de su grande condición de amigo, es usted el revolu-
cionario que cumple sus compromisos con el pueblo mexicano y
ejerco el poder en la seguridad de su propia responsabilidad,
haciendo pesar el Derecho como inviolable principio y como
condición irrenunciable de los magnificos preceptos de la Ley.
Usted se debe a México, se por Procurador y por El Trabajo y
Muna, duento: diéndose de cobardes articulos que circulan
planos de insultos y comentarios de quienes no creen en la re-
levancia de su actuación, partiendo esta critica de los embusteros
cuyo sistema hacen de la murmuración una arma innoble
DIJARDIN-
conchalada para volcar sus amarguras..la ayuda y dinero ajeno
no y la responde habilidoso ha permitido que personas tan
descalificadas, moral e intelectualmente, o no Victor Rico Gz
Un y otros tantos no hayan ilegando a destacar como articulistas
condo en prestigiosas revistas en Italia para verguenza
de la intelectualidad mexicana. No obstante su con-
dición de extrajero Rico Galán ha demostrado su desacato hacia
nuestras leyes e instituciones, y su desprecio a la tradic-
nol hospitalidad mexicana. Escribe deliberadamente prometiendo
do engañar a ang lectores de que lleguen onsiderar que el
Regimen del Sr. Lic. Adolfo López Mateos, es enetigo de la
clase trabajadora. Por lo que se deduce que Victor es uno de
los tantos extranjeros que sobran en el País. Lo que ha hecho
usted es que se respete nuestra soberania y similarmente ha
ha defendido y dejado inocolumes todos los derechos de los tra-
njadores mexicanos, ver lo que seria un error imperdonable
confundir su digna y patriotica actitud con una claudicación
de los ideales y principios a que siempre ha sostenido y defen-
dido."

Lo que me permito transcribir a usted, con
la atenta suplica de que se sirva girar sus respetables infor-
mes, a efecto de que se haga una pinmatosa invest'igación so-
bre lo anterior, así con la calidad migratoria que es titu-
lar dicho extranjero, su domicilio y las actividades a que se
encuentra dedicado, informando oportunamente a esto Departamento.

# RESPETO A MEXICO

La conducta del sefior Victor Galán participando en el Stimo alboroto de agitadores extremistas, plantea ante la opinión pública la necesidad de conocer a fondo cual es y cuál debe ser la actitud de las autoridades con Individuos que, si bien poseen la calidad de mexicanos por habérseles concedido la naturalización, su misma situación les impone observar ciertas normas de respeto y consideración hacia su nuevo país y sus instituciones.

Las leyes mexicanas, por su esencia democrática, son de Igual aplicación para todos los habitantes del pala, y únicamente ciertas esferas de acción se consideran reservadas para los mexicanos. Especialmente en el terreno de la acción política, nuestras leyes señalan discriminaciones en favor de los mexicanos que reúnan ciertos requisitos respecto a su nacimiento y a su ascendencia. No nos corresponde analizar la justificación de estas normas, o desaprobarias, porque evidentemente responden a necesidades de nuestro desenvolvimiento histórico, aceptadas y puestas en práctica por la nación y sus gobiernos.

El señor Rico Galán y todos los que como él poseen la calidad de mexicanos por naturalización, gozan de todas las prerrogativas y derechos concedidos por las leyes del país, y también poseen todas las obligaciones y deberes por ellas sefiniados. En cambio a un extranjero como el norteamericanos Barry Bernard Primus, qulen tomó parte en el escándalo del domingo último, inmediatamente se le expulsó del pals, porque a ningún extranjero se le permite inmiscuirse en nuestros asuntos políticos y no por su! parentesco con una respetable familia mexicana como es la del pintor Alfaro Siqueiros.

Pero las garantias y las prerrogativas de que es; titülar el señor Victor Rico Galán, a pesar de su! calidad de auténtico pandiliero de la pluma, no quieren significar que las autoridades policiacas y ml.. gratonas investiguen a fondo cuáles son sus activi-: dades y cuál su verdadera situación migratoria. No nos refiramos al término gratitud, que debla ser suficiente para quienes como Rico Galán han sido aceptades por México como sus hijos, porque esa palabra es desconocida en el léxico de individuos afectos a considerarse como la máxima expresión de ir sabiduria y a ostentarse en el extranjero como "la pluma"

Victor Rico Galán

1. ESLIME-1 met Galán in the latter part of August 1964 in Guatemala. He was assigned to help bring Galan to Yon Sosa. He met Galán on Kilometer 17 of the "Highway to the Atlantic", at the village of Kixkhag El Chato, and drove him to Kilometer 189, where others were waiting to guide him from there.

2. Galán told E-1 that he was a reporter wand was coming to interview Yon Sosa. He said that he had come before and that he crossed the border clandestinely. Someone from the group that met them at Kilometer 189 told E-1 that this was the fifth time that Galán had come to see Yon Sosa and that he carried messages and money to Yon Sosa.

3. After E-1 arrived in Mexico City, Mahan asked the party for permission to interview him for an article for Siempre. He wanted to interview E-1 about his arrest, torturo. by the police, and expulsion from Santeeal,. Victor Manuel Gutierrez told E-1 to grant the interview and to give Galán all the details he needed. E-1 talked to Galán, if the offices of Siempre, on three ocasiones, twice in March and once in April. However, he did not giva him the interview as at that time he had not yet obtained papers permitting hia to remain in Mexico and did not want to jeopardizo hic chances of obtaining them. He promised to send Galán a card when his papers were obtained and give him the intervien thon.

4. E-1, does not like the idea of giving this interview to Galán and has not contacted him oven though he now has his papers. He plans to do nothing

5. E-l said Galán has also made propaganda films which were shown to the guerrillas in Guatemala. They were simple films which could be made in the home, generadly just consisting of someone giving a talk or lecture. They were made both in Spanish and in the local Indian language. E-l said that the last film Galán made was confiscated by the police. He didn't know if it was the Guatemalan or the Mexican police.

D. Rico to Dr. Emilio Cordero, Dominican exile in Mexico City:
Rico complains to Cordero that he was supposed to call and that the other (Nikolay) has already called twice. Cordero says that he called yesterday but there was no one in, they told him they had gone out together. Is the friend there? Victor says no, that he said he would be busy between 1630 and 1700 hours and Victor will be busy until 1900 hours. Cordero asks to let it go until tomorrow, as he himself is very busy. He suggests coming to Victor's at 1600 hours. Victor prefers to call before that at 1530 hours. Cordero congratulates him on his article in Siempre. A foolish thing, Victor says. Cordero asks him if he has seen Luis Suarez' article and what did he think of it? Rico says it is written in first person, very superficial, very much a personal adventure. Very journalistic, Cordero comments. Yes, but journalistic like Serer's (Station comment: Probably Julio Sherer Garcia, writer for daily Excelsior) and to Victor it appears to be more...Cordero says that the situation there grows worse. Victor asks if he saw Mayobre's thing. Cordero says yes, very good. Well, comments Victor, that of Mayobre was not expected but it is that the thing is so obvious. Cordero will call tomorrow at 1500 hours.

E. Saul (Inu) to Rico: Saul tells Rico that a friend arrived from New York yesterday. Would he like to talk with him? Rico says of course. They decide on Monday at Rico's home. When Rico says he does not speak English Saul says that since he doesn't either they will have to have another person.

3. May 21: 0615 to 2400 hours:

A. Leonov to Rico: Leonov greets Rico in a very friendly way. Rico says that yesterday he talked with The Man, he had a lot of work and preferred to leave it for today. He asks Leonov to call again at 1600 hours. Leonov will call.

B. Luis Suarez and Rico Gulan: Suarez sent a very strong article against the United States on the Dominican situation which was published yesterday. He did not want to lose the chance no matter what they thought and they said that he had abandoned the work, never having had a contact with "them". Suarez and Rico discuss the articles on the Dominican situation published by both Suarez and Sherer Carcia of Excelsior. Rico says that Sherer's article was the first to give the Latin American point of view on the Dominican situation, Suarez agrees but says, "the interview with Caamano, no." Victor comments that Sherer did a good job. Suarez does not known what happened with Sherer. ila published one thing that he showed him in Santo Domingo, after he published the thing about the OAS the following day, and no more, he dried up, they have not published him anymore. Suarez comments that the President received him. Why? It seems unbelieveable that they have made this effort in order to publish only two days. Rico terminates the conversation with congratulations to Suarez.

C. Cordero to Rico: Victor is waiting for a call from The Man (Leonov?) at 1600 hours to make a date at 1700 hours at home. Emilio accepts and will be there at 1700 hours.

D. Leonov to Rico: Victor sets the meeting for 1700 hours at his home. Leonov agrees.

B. Rico to Cordero: Rico tells Cordero that he will be waiting for him between 1530 and 1600 hours and asks him to bring all the data that he has. Cordero asks if he wants sconomic data or...All that you have, Rico says. Cordero will come.

C. Leonov to Rico: Rico tells Leonov that he has been waiting for "the man" (Cordero?), he was calling hiu. Leonov says he went for a long walk and has just got back. He'll come in twenty minutes. Victor will be waiting for him.

THE THESIS OF THE PIECE IS THAT A NEW REGULATION HAS BEEN CREATED IN THE OAS ADMITTING THAT INTER-VENTION IS VERY GOOD. RICO COMMENTS THE IDEA OF LEAVING THE OAS IS POPULAR. ALBERTO PRESENTED IT AT THE ROUND TABLE AT THE PRIVERSITY (AS A POSSIPILITY). THERE WAS A LOT OF APPLAUSE WHEN IT WAS MIMICO, ALSO A LOT OF GOOD CONDENTARY

CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: Meeting with WUINDICO, 18 May 1965

1. RUTHERFORD met W/1 at the latter's apartment on 18 May 1965.

2. The following information was obtained:

a. Dominican Republic. During the briefing by the WH representative on 14 May, it was agreed that W/1 would attempt to have the Havana broadcast of 2 May replayed through his friend Mauro LUCENTINI of ANSA, New York. It was felt that this approach would be more desirable than using W/1 directly, in view of his efforts to appear as a liberal journalist. During the meeting W/1 attempted to contact Lucentini, but ascertained that he had gone off on a holiday for the weekend. Upon learning that Lucentini would return to New York City during the evening of 16 May, it was agreed that W/1 would contact him at that time in an effort to have the story transmitted on 17 May. In addition to the major capitals in Latin America, W/1 also thought that the story would be sent to Rome.

b. Following a 'phone call from the WH Desk, RUTHERFORD subsequently briefed W/1 on the fact that the same story had been carried in the 2 May edition of *Hoy* in Havana. (COMMENT: RUTHERFORD pointed out to the Headquarters rep that, in his opinion, it might not be advisable to inform Lucentini of the *Hoy* article as it might raise an objection in his mind concerning the current value of the news.)

c. Briefed on both the radio broadcast and the *Hoy* article, W/1 was disinclined to mention the *Hoy* article to Lucentini for the same objection noted above. He was instructed to use his own discretion.

d. On the evening of 16 May W/1 contacted Lucentini and outlined his request. He explained to Lucentini that this was a good opportunity for a scoop on a hot item. W/1, in order to offset any objections on the part of Lucentini, told him that the radio broadcast had occurred on 13 May. He did not mention the *Hoy* article. According to W/1, Lucentini was less than enthusiastic about transmitting the story through his facilities, pointing out that it was no longer news. After some persuasion, according to W/1, Lucentini finally agreed to send the following abbreviated story to Buenos Aires either the evening of 16 May or early 17 May:

'On Friday, May 13, Radio-Havana cited Juan B. Mejia leader of Dominican '14 of June' party who had given an interview to Mexican Journalist Victor Lico Galan in which he declared over the telephone that 'many leaders of the June 14 movement have disappeared, but at the same time numerous contingents of insurgents are reported in the mountains of the region' and that 'the 14 of June movement has much control of the situation.'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 175

-2-

o. In order to supplement the Lucentini effort, W/1 prepared a more detailed version of the radio broadcast and cabled it to Correio do Povo in Porto Alegre, Brasil. He paid for the cable in New York ($40.70) and signed it with his first and last initials and "our NY correspondent." The cabled article in Spanish is forwarded herewith as attachment #2.

f. Q. Kalinkin. On 17 May W/1 was invited to a cocktail party at the home of Lucentini, 305 East 56th Street, NYC. The reception was on the occasion of the departure of Ricardo Berla, Vice President of Olivetti Underwood in New York. W/1 was surprised to find that Kalinkin, the Soviet employed in the UN Secretariat, was present. It will be recalled that w/1 originally met Kalinkin at the home of Faubion Bowers in Manhattan in June 1964. Lucentini was also present on that occasion. W/1 could not comment on whether Lucentini met Kalinkin for the first time at the Bowers affair. W/1 is not aware of any close relationship between Kalinkin and Lucentini.

3. Finances:

Rutherford paid W/1 the following:

a. Cable to Brazil--------------------$40.70

b. Round-trip cab fare to ANGSA--------- 2.00

TOTAL----------------------------$42.70

A signed receipt was obtained.

4. Next Meeting: Friday, 21 May, at 1100.

Miric called VRG last night, about 3 times. From 2000 to 2300. They went out to dinner. Miric wanted VAG's opinion on what happened. VKG thinks this is normal. The diseabardation of the (U.S.) marines "is normal. It is withing all the a calcuations, analyses of the reality. You understand that if they can bomb a Socialist country, logically in their backyard, they (U.S.) can do what they want." Will VRG go to conference? No. Miric would like to talk to VKG about 15 minutes. Come by VaG's before the conference. Miric has car problem. Or Miric can come by after the press conference. Thinks he will do that.

She can have him phone VKG. VKG explains about the press conference of Dominican exiles and he should be interested in this...

13.5 In. Luis with VRG, who answera. A group of Dominicen exiles came to see Ynd among them Marcio Mejia kicart, Luis' friend. There ere "nore acrious" people in this (than MMK). They are going to give a press conference today at 1600. Luis is interested, Luis saw VAG's article today in "El Dia" and Luis follows VAG's line (against U.S.). VRG is siso writing an article for "Siempre." Gives Luis the address where conference will take place. VAG also called Doidov (ph) or Cucheyov (ph), but not there. Did not find Leonov in either. Left a message for then to call VAG. Becasse when the conference of Mary Brack (ph), they did not appear either. They come by VRG 911 one aftar-noon getting the declecatione from VAG. Luis will also go. More than news, what they have is idea to understand the problea.

Ная VAG read "Ultimas Noticias" teday? No. All are declare-tions of things going on there "since they have don't been able to dominate (Beach movement). They say it is a Communist shuversion, Czech arms and there is an O.B.A. meeting. They don't mention Bosch." VKC is not surprised and would not be surprised if they did not get another Cuban crisis out of this same situation (another pretext, ha means, to invade Cuba?), "Ultimas Noticias" only makes mention of Communist and Cuba. VRG says that since 1937 they (American) haven's landed in America. Very grave situation and precedent.

Does Luis have Marcic's phone? No. About where Valerio Tru-jano is located...

15.2 In. Leonov with VRG, who answers. Greetings. VRG says Leonov has a Catalan sccent. VKG looked for TASS and PRAVDA correspondents. Thought they might be with Leonov...

Luis saw V.G's article. Yes, but they did not put on the signature. It is best that way. With a signature it would have been Luis' article. Without signature, it appears more editorial. Luis prefers it this way politically. This was just an error, since VKG talked to Alberto about this. It was an error in the shop. Luis is happier about this. When Luis sends this to Puerto Rico is carries more weight this way. Luis asks if he charges for this. VG thinks so, but will ask. Asks with discretion. What most interested him was that it came out. VRG will call MO on Saturday or Sunday so they can get together. After 1440, 29 April

## 17.0

Out to 46-60-15. Vr.G with Jardon, who answers. Greetings. What is new in Santo Domingo? Quite a bit. Just a moment.

The last message they received came from San Juan, Puerto Rico. They have obtained complete control of City of Santo Domingo. In the morning, they had heard that the insurgents had obtained control of all radio systems (stations) of the capital and started attack on base of San Isidro. France Presse told Vag about the attack of San Isidro. The last heard is that they are in control of Santo Domingo city. They have taken 4 tanks, destroyed another 2 in capital. They will see if they can take over San Isidio. That is the air base. And the (U.S.) marines? VIG heard a radio bulletin that they disembarked another 100 marines. They had said yesterday that, in case it were necessary, they would disembark 1,000 not 100 more marines. And reactions? Hasn't anyone protested? No, besides Cuba and USSR, no one. What did USSR say? Doesn't say. HO goes on that the total amount of men fighting for Bosch is 15,000 - civil and military men. The major part is civil because, apart from Camagno (ph) and Montes, who refused to accept transaction, the rest of the officers hacked out (of revolution)...

There is a quite well founded rumor that it is not remote that the marines, are made to fell the need, to protect liberty and democracy, to intervene categorically and to find proofs of the Castro-Communist intervention. There is also speculation that there will be a change of 160° in the Latin American situation and that the 0.8.A. meeting may not be result as planned (to protest against intervention in Santo Domingo)." Jardon says this is possible. Did VAG notice yesterday in Johnson's message, at the end, "the disembarkation of marines will not only take place in Santo Domingo, but this (group) will be lent to citizens of other countries, some of which have already asked for "our" (U.S.) help," VKG says that he is referring to citizens of other countries living in Santo Domingo, Jardon disagrees, then says, yes, it can be interpreted in the a two ways. VRG asks Jardon to send a cable with this rumor. It can be true or false. Jardon will do so. He will include it in the message he sends out at 1800.

VAG asks Jardon to call him if anything important comes up. Yes.

Will Jardon have Fidel's speech on Sunday? He is sure be will, but thinks the complete text will be sent on Sunday. Should have it complete around 1800.

18.5 In. Sro. Rien with VKG, who answers. Greetings...VKG has been very busy with the Dominican affair. Some Dominican friends were at his house this morning and phoned a lot. Sta. A. says Bosch won't get in. She read it. The tus last news is that they (insurgents) have taken the whole capital, Santo Domingo, and the Americans were disembarked. Bosch won't go. That is the agreement made but people did not accept this agreement and fighting has continued...

18.0 In. Edmundo (Jardon) with VKG, who answers. There is some news. The Ban Peruvian Chancellor criticized the disembarkation of U.S. marines, stating that this was grave blow to inter-American relations...Washington states that Mexico eritised criticized the disembarkation of U.S.. troops, in the secret session celebrated today in 0.8.A. Colombia, Chile, Venezuela and Costa Rica protested that this unilateral action, and requested legal measures so this action would be a combined action. VRG asks for the fora in which Mexico criticized this action. Nothing specific in this message. Should have it later. The bombarding of San Isidro has started - an hour ago. Informex should have text of Mexico by now. It would be good to ask for it. Call him if there is anything now. VAC is writing up this for "Siempre."

19.0 In. Miric with VAG, who assets. The acinza have entered action Yes. Two civils have been killed, Miric says there is a new element. ...60 marines around the Embassy. Toey have opened fire against U.S. Embassy. They tried to enter 4 or 5 embassies. Vad thinks that the80 are pretexts (for U.S. action). Miric thinks ac. Tant thinks are ance grave. Miric says that there are at least 2 Communist groups and ou Pro-Castro group, called the 14 de Junio. They don't know whether shey are the ones directing the rebellion or whether they just joined it. but there is great insistence that these areCommunists, trained in Cuba and Czech. On the other hand, the 6th float of Caribbean is lined along the Dominican coast and a cerries. The Dominicen Anb. in Washington continues to insist that this is a Consunist attempt to take over Santo Domingo. Does Miric know that this Aab. is act a Dominican? Bogilla Atiles in a U.S. citizen legally.

Aabes of Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Costa mica, and Colombia spoke in 0.1.4. Rosting - all protesting the interventica and that this is a violation of inter-American rights. Radio Mabana only said thes Mexico bad censured this, V.Gaaya, but saya O.E.A. is trying to cover the intervention. Yes, there is a petition to this effect by Venezuela, thas 0.6.A. should intervene. Does not say to legalize but means this. The Voice of America says that it is not true that insurgents are not in control the city, shat the troops are trying to encircle nome points which they hold in Santo Domingo and does not mention the attack of Saa Isidro. VAG says that UP says that - in cables from San Juan - that insurgents hold the city, attacked San Isidro, destroyed 2 tanks and took 4 toaks.

Hotel Ambassador. There is protest by U.S. Red Cross stating that there are at least 400 dead and about 1,200 wounded. The Americans are distributing milk, etc. Both heard this over Voice of U.S. VRG comments (ironically) that "they are very nice people" (buenas genstes). There is also a declaration of Dept. of Defense that since marines are there, this does not mean U.S. supports one or another side.

VAG asks if Miric has called... No, not yet. Not there yet.

It is nearly 1900. Yes, but he goes to work at 1800.

"These young people" brought their bulletin and a copy for Misic.
It is long but does not state anything - saying that it is not true that they are Communists, that this a country fighting against oppression.
ViG says this is habitual shetoric of latin Americans. Keep it for Miric.

Call VAG if Miric finds out anything about Mexico's position or statements in this.

23.2 In. Moasks VAG, who answers, if they took the declarations by (of exiles). How was the conference? It took place during a terrible rain...keporters fron "Excelsior," "Novedades," and "El Dia." Had Geclarations all written out for President, Cardenas and PKI. Not really a conference, Just a few commentaries. Mogave the men the addresses of press agencies which did not appear. They were going to deliver this declaration. VAG says these people are worthwhile. Declarations were good, according to No.

Van asks if MO know that marines have started to kill people.
Read in "Ultimas Noticias" that first exchange of fire took place - with 70 marines at the U.S. Embagay. MO just got a home. Mexico also protested in O.L.A. meeting. Yea, and a lot of countries, Yes, but they wanted to make it a united effort. VLG has not heard the terms in whichxas Mexico censured this action of U.S.

Has Ved written this yet? He is preparing material. Wants to weise it for tomorrow. VRG says it would be best to give this to "Siempre" on Monday. VRG will phone Pajes tomorrow early. Pajes will arrive on the train around 0900 of 1000. Should be at offi e around 1100, Would like to hand in his article on Monday.

About Sac Isidro being attacked... There is no foreign correspondent in & Santo Domingo. All information is coming from San Juan. The ones sending out information are Dominican reporters and this is probably being censured. They found out about the carine disembarking through Washington. MO sent a cable in detail when he got home found a cable from Adrede (7) In Berlin - that he wanted info on disembaraation, MO sent into to Bertin. They will talk tomorrow. MO is Luis (Spanish extraction).

25.5 In. : Valentin Cucherov (ph) of Pass with VAG, who answers. It was shane he could not attend the press conference of Dominicana. Would like to see these aen. Does VC have the address?

confusing situation in Dominican Republic. What does VKG thinks? It is complex (side-steps him). Dominican exiles were going to try the Embassy to find out where they could locate Valentin Cucheroν.
When can they meet one another? when VC likes. Perhaps on Monday. Call VAG on Monday to arrange a time. Will phone Monday morning. After 2120, 29 April

20.5 In. Miric (v) with VRG, who answers. Cucherov just phoned. He just found out about the press conference. Miric says that that correspondents of News Agencies he likes very much (ironic?). Cucherov aaked VRG what he thought about the situation. ViG replied that he thought the situation was confusing.

They say that they (Bosch men) have 50,000 men ready to enter the fight. Continue to attack in mass San Isidro. Is this from Informex? Yes.

There is an officiel deddaration (of Mexico) essentially disapproving the marines. President is still very worried about situation in sister Republic and that the govt. thinks it is shanafutxt very sad that U.S. took this action. It is only 20 or 30 lines. Doesn't it mention the Ο.Ε.Λ. Νo, but the sense la the same, with an accent of a little more worry. There is nows that the Mexican Embassy has also been attacked in Dominican Republic. Have attacked Salvadoran, Peruvian, Mexican,
ax Ecuadoran and U.S. Babassies. VRG doubts this. Thinks these may have been provacateurs. Why would they attacks the Embassies? The Mexican Amb. is in almost constant communication with Mexico - informing what is going on. And it is not sure yet that there are any victims among the U.S. citizens. But there has been further disembarkation. VAG thinka they will occupy the territory. This will be a repetition of 1916. Miric says it won't be the same exactly. No, it was then to form the empate and it is now to defead.

As to the O..A.. things are not going well. There was a 5 hour meeting which did not resolve anything. VAG heard about this. They are back in meeting.

VAG is going to ask Pajes to let hia turn his story in on Monday. Everything is too contradictory yet.
Miric has taken his position and is now writing his story. Misici would like to have text (of Fidel). Call Jerdon. If VK has any nows, he will phone Miric.

28.5 Out to 45-60-15. VAG aska, who sawere, for Jardon (or Perdon; jardon takesthe phone. Asks if he has the declaration of Mexico. Yos. Aska him to read it.

Situation is confusing to nors Hexican conduct with their international principais, especially with respect to American problems. They can state that they deplore the blood being shed, as stated in the O.li.A., and sufferinga of Dominican Republic and sorry that U.S. govt. has had to act in such a manner which reminds then of such sad memories of several countries in the headsphere and a pe that marine force occupation will be the shortest time as possible...that Dominican xepublic can resolve their probleas without any direct or indirect exterior influence.

They are expecting another disembarkation of more marines.
VKG has heard that this has already taken place. And also said that
they (Bosch) have 30,000 armed civil people and attacking San Isidro.
VKG thinks 30,000 is too much. It was said in Santo Domingo that
there were 15,000 (pro-Bosch). MO thinks those do not enough arms.
Yes, those is enough arms because the army of theirs is bestial.

VKG has the complete text (of Mexico) and summarizes this for Miric. (One of VKG - VKG takes good shorthand, would if it or has received a written copy.) Miric says that this is a positive declaration. No other govt. has declared in this form.
Also does not mention the O.E.A. but mentions that hopes that Dominican Republic can resolve its problems without indirect or direct influence (can't approve of united attacked).

There is a report that a group of General Bening of 1,500 men has changed to insurgents. All these items are very different points.
Most of them are from Cell Juan. Bosch probably has the phone in his hand there and perhaps thinks are too optimistic. Miric says that the popular rebellion is winning. They, the marines, are supposed to be forming a cordon - for evacuating of Americans - so this must be several thousands. If this is to airport, the airport is 23 miles from city, the defense line must be quite long.

Did VKG give those persons a copy of bulletin? No, but in read it to them over the phone.

Did EC see that Mexico made a declaration? Yes, but not strong. It's essence is a help. Yes, but in comparison to the one made by De Leon (it is weak). Yes, but De Leon's attaches a proposal that O.E.A. Joined (in united effort with U.S.) EC says that Uruguay's declaration is also very good. VKG has not seen it. EC saw it at UP. It was coming in on teletype.

Did VAG read the report? Yes, but it refers to a very special aspect. EC says it refers basically to the death of Trujillo and the counte coup. This is not very necessary to show in the case of Santo Domingo.

13.2 contd.

MO reads VKG Bosch's declarations - announced that the Portaleza de Ozana, that is, the policel constituted a great victory!...manifested the fact that probably a few Communists are fighting for constitutional rights, but pointed out that these & forces were armed by the Army (7) and trained in the U.S. and not by the Communists. He assured that U.S. govt. and people that the forces were not being directed by "turbas" (Communists?). Bosch stated that it would be impossible to establish in the Dominican Republic a régime similar to the one in Cuba. He pointed out that had the Cubans done what the Dominicans are doing now, Fidel Castro would never have been converted into ...fam feudal lord (7) of the Cuban revolution...
(MO comments - that this is terrible.) VKG asks what did MO expect from Bosch. Nothing from Bosch. He fell for some reason, MO says. ѴRO, comments that least important thing is his stupidity, the worst part is his reactionnary attitude.

Julian came by and wanted MO to go (somewhere), but MO told him (Julian) to tell this to Pajes en he would have some permission (to go). But didn't do anything...

MO suggests that VKG attack Bosch.

Pajes was in a bad mood. He did not even say hello to VIRG. And turned his back on VKG when talking about Dominican Republic...VG will write all necessary and Pajes can do what he likes.

Does not mention U.S. but tolks about beginnings of PKI, Juarez, etc. xix It was read by Senator * Bolaños Cacho. PAI can't be indifferent to problems, a danger of Dominican republic's losing its liberty, the internal problem can't be resolved by foreiga influence and armed forces which converts into a factor which is egainst the will of the country. It is quite well done. A good protest.

Dominican Aab. has resigned his post. Can't consent to the fact that his country has been invaded.

VNG has a int of things or rather a package for done Auroга (HO's wife). Will teke it by.

that there have been 1,000 killed. There is nothing on cease fire. The
PRI protested against the invasion into Santo Domingo today. MO says that
they called from Santo Domingo that the people called the Cubans to try
to achieve Cease Fire...? VLG will try to phone "him" (7) now. They

Asked VAG to call Santo Domingo to find out th whether it is true since
they can't. Where can VAG call there? One moment. But give his a number
of one that works (that is, a aumber of a Communist who will give them the
picture)...Or. C. suggests his wife's phone.. Couldn't he give him another
phone? No, does not have any phone there. Couldn't he let him know where
VKG could locate Canagno. Dr.C's wife's phone is 9-66-02. And Tamagno
(not Camagno)? There could he be located? Or any other person who could
give him a clear idea of the situation. Mejia would be a good person, bat
MO does not have his phone. Hejia phoned this morning. Doesn't anyone
know his phone here? What is C's wife's nome? Josefina de Cordero,
Josefina Painado de Cordero. Nould she know? Yes, she must kuoy phone

VKG asks to talk to Radio Habana in Cuba. With Orlando

VAG with Fundora. VNG called and was told he could talk in
2 or 3 weeks. They can't call Santo Domingo....connection very bad...
VAG can't hear...40 comes on line and explains that they can hear hia
in Habana. VAG repeats the matter of PAI. The PRI is having a National
Assembly. They protested the invasion in Dominican Republic. About the
call to Santo Domingo, it is via New York and the operator in N.Y.

false because two friends of VAG, Dcainicans, tolked to people in Sauro

C. placed another call today and he was told they could put his call through on 4 May. There are thousands of calls. Habana has heard about Cease Fire and they want to prove whether this is true or not. Santo Domingo can call here easily. They could send a cable to C's wife and have her call. They could have Radio Habana broadcast for them to call Dr. Cordero here in Mexico. That is dangerous. Or they could say for Santo Domingo to call VKC. The easiest thing would be to send a cable. Yes, but this is very urgent. Could have kadio Habana ask Else to phone hia. Or Just say - anyone to call him. Juan B. could hear this. VKG will do this. Ho will phone VKG tomorrow.

EC takes the phone. Did BC hear Fidel? Yes, VKG says they Ханинний аre in the center of history. How did he like it? Wonderful. The first two hours were dedicated to Dominican situation. He made-a correct analysis of Dominican situation, who Bosch is, etc. And at the end, he gave out his philosophy.

VKG talked to Radio Habana twice. BC was just headng over Radio Habana what Juan B. Mejia stated. And Habana had called Cordero, but there is no line now to Habana. In case C talks to his wife or Marcio (Mejia Ricart) talks to Bosch, VRG would like to be there. HO thinks Marcio will talk to Bosch. Can VKG talk to him? Yes. And perhaps EC can inform VAG inmediately about whatever EC's wife informe him - at whatever time it is. In case anyone calls EC, be it his wife, Juan B., or another member of the Party, he will let VRG know. In case he talks to Juan D., give him VG's phone so they can phone. VIRG. Og give VRG's number to any other member (of Party) who calla because VAG in turning over information derectly (to Habana). They are very interested.

From 2230, 1 May (Saturday) to 0845, 2 Mary 1965

2.0 Out to 09. Victor Rico Galan (VAG) with long distance operator.
VRG has been reporting in from the phone of a friend's house, but he is now at home. As soon as they have communication to Cuba, call him here. With St. Orlando Fundora or with Sr. Vines, kadio Habana.

3.7 In, from long distance. They still don't have communication with Cuba. Will he continue to wait? Yes.

4.0 In, from long distance. Asks with whom VKG wants to talk to in Cuba? With Fundora or Viñas? Yes. VAG takes the phone. Says there is no one by the name of Fundora or Viñas inkadio Habana. Of course, they are the Director and Sub-Director of Radio Habana.

Finally gets through to Fundora. VRG says that they talked to Bosch last night at 2330. VRG couldn't call him because line was out to Cuba. Bosch made sensational declarations. MO will record it.

They change phones. They asked Bosch what his opinion was of the O.B.A. Commission. VRG did not talk, but a Dominican friend talked to Bosch. However, theyrecorded the conversation. Bosch said some important things. This friend asked Bosch what he thought of OEA Com- mision. Bosch said that O.E.A. and nothégare the same thing. Who talked to Bosch. Marcio Mejia Ricart. They then asked Bosch if they the U.S. marines had occupied the city. He said they had and they bad gotten as far as Avenida Mella, near downtown area, but that the armed civilions forced then back until Avenida Maximo Gomez, about 3-1/2 kilometers back. Ave. Maximo Gomez is what one might call their combat line since it is the zone where the U.S. Embassy iอ. So, they made them return to their original pat positions. This took place yesterday afternoon. But the most important thing they asked Bosch what political solution Bosch saw. lle answered "textually - 'It appears that in Washington they are thinking of converting Santo Domingo ina Fideicomiso.' Then he commented ironically, so "we get out of colonialism into independence." VRG says that this is of course very grave. As F. knows there are 2 or 3 left in the world of Fideicomisos - in Southern Africa. This would be unprecedented case that they convert an independent country into a country under Fidei- comiso (Protectorates). When Mejia Ricart asked if they (U.S.) want to convert "us into a colony." Boach replied that Yes, into a colony but with 25,000 armed sen. Civilians, of course. Bosch further said that that the people had done was something extraoddinary and that he hod complete faither in the people." B. did not want to say anything to provoke the uprising of the people because he (Bosch) is out of the country "and from outside, this is a comfortable cole. If I were inside I would take up the responsibilites."

VRG had to pay the call since Fundore did not call him. VKG will be ruined. this, so Fundora should have a call always in for VAG. VAG will let him know when he has anything new.

F. aske what the situation in inside Dominican depublic. There is nothing new. They are expecting a call from Dominican kepublic to- day. VAG may have something in 2 hours. In this case, VRG will call. F. will then call VKG back at 2300, Habana time, or 2200, Mexico tine. (Or 0900, 1000 hours).

VKG takes the phone, but gets no reply.

13.3 In. Operator says that VRG talked 7 minutes to Cuba.

13.5 In. Operator asks Sra. Diener (v), who answers, for VKG.
VAG takes the phone. Call goes through. Fundoza asks if there is anything new. No, not yet, but expects to have something in abut an hour - between 1130 and 1200. All right.

14.0 In. Cordero with VAG, who answers. VRG finally talked to Hainna. Cordero talked to Juan Pedro Domingo and C. gave him VG's phone. He will phone VRG. Fine. C. has the notes written down. Can read them to VAG. Call back in 5 minutes so VRG can have paper and pencil.

14.2 Ia. Cordero with VRG, who answers. C. telis VRG to put his recorder on to take note of what was said. VRG was doing that.

C. says: At 0915 Juan B. Mejia, members of Provisional Executive Central Committee of the Political Group 14 de Julio called Cordero from Santo Domingo and informed the following:

The Yankees are bombing and machine gunning the city. (VRG asks if they are bombing with airplanes. He did not tell C.) Could be artillery, perhape naval. They have launched their tanke and marins against the people. A revolutionary order reigns in the entire city. Yesterday, 1 May, the Yankees opened some stores in the downtown and called the people to sack them. The people refused to do ao. They then looked for prostitutes and filaed them sacking the stores. The interest is to show to international public opinion that chaos reigns in the country to be able to justify their open-faced sad un justified ailitary intervention. That is, the people refused to enter into this propagands because they had the cameras ready. They only got prostitutes and trash like that. They will publish this in the newspapers. The armed people are willing to resist the Yankee invasion and to conserve their sovereignty and independence. The stangge between the U.s. forces and constitutionalists has ceased. All the forces of people are concentrating in fighting the Yankee invader. There is a need to awaken the Mexican public opinion. MO wants VKG to help him in this. Of course. So, they (Mexicans) can send cables, etc. to United Nations for their tomorrow meeting on the Dominican Republic. They want pressure so that the United Nations and not the O.6.A. which combats the intervention. The combat with the Yankees is violent in different sectors of the city. The trans- mission sent out yesterday and today from Radio Habana mention hia (Mejia) as member of the group did him a lot of damage. The reaction in Santo Domingo has been taken to point up and to be used as a Communist faceos of their fight as a result of the broadcast of Radio Habana. Mejia told C. that he was going to call VKG to clarify this with VAG because this is very delicate, VAG will communicate this zight now to Radio Habana. Mejia further said: They should stop making such indications, like, Juan B. Mejia of 14 de Julio gaya...The Kadio Habana geid that this was an interview (of Mejia) with VAG. Another point - Should deny that they have a hideout in the mountains as informed by Radio Habana. This does a lot of damage. No told Nejia about Bosch's coay - about the U.S. wanting Dominican Rep. in Fideiconian

(Protectorate). Mejia said that they fight to the last man against this. Mejia will phone VKG. It is extremely important that Radio Habana deny that Mejia is involved in this, as well as the name of the group (which is Communist). Can give this as source of someone inMexico. They should not mention names nor 14 de Julio nor Juan B. or anyone. This does a tremendous damage.

Didn't he say anything about the situation inside (country)? No, because their call was limited to 3 minutes.

Did Cordero see "Excelsior"? Yes. Did "that" come out? Yes, came out in headlines and has about 4 columns...reads it to VkG.. that is, the heading. Vi Ghas not received his paper yet.

VAG thinks they should wate up a bulletin for the newspapers. The Dominican exiles should sign it. In today's "El Dia," they give a lot of space to them (the exiles here who gave out deddarations the other day). They mention all four. "El Dia" published about Bosch, a little mixed up by Marcio, but in general is good. Mentions their bulletin, etc.

VRG is going to call Habana right now. VRG will take the points off recorders and type them up and clarify them (about mentioning names) with Habana. VRG thinks that Mejia should write up a bulletin for newspapers - stating this is information received by relatives etc. over the phone. For Mexico press.

Mejia said that VRG can tell Habana that the only way the people in Dominican Republic now have a way of finding out about internationa1 situation is via Voice of America and Radio Habana. The enemies are using this propaganda of Kadio Habana. They should deny about Mejia and about fighting outside. Fight is in the city. Don't mention the bills...

VAG is at home writing today. In case VRG has to go out, he will leave phone where he is. Mejia might phone VRG today at noon. Should have his recorder ready in cage he calls. VRG has it ready. (MO is ilio Cordero.)

The news given out by Rodio Habana (VRG interjecto his note) that there are guerriles in the mountains is not true. This has been denied by 14 de July Group. Radio Habana said that one of the Directors of 14 de 84 July Group talked to VRG and said this and 14 de July Group has denied this.

Miric asks about yesterday's speach (Fidel's speech). Supposes that he should call "Prensa Latins." VaGheard the speech. It was

very important, VAG says. Call Jardon for the speech.
About the matter of Bosch, which VRG gave Miric yesterday, it has been published today - textually by Deschamps.
How does VRG see things of O.E.A? Very grave. Did Miric read Chile's position? Yes. That is the correct one. They are proceeding as if there was no occupationx. 0.6.4. can discuss a lot, (but do nothing). O.E.A. is nothing, as Beach says.
Call VRG in case Miric hears anything. Miric won't ta ve anything as direct as VkG. Yes, but liric has more time to listen to the Voice of U.S. Yes, Miric is listening. Vi has a call pending from Habann and is expecting a call from Santo Domingo. Habana is calling for info from VRG. Yes, but they should not do foolish things (mention things). The foolish thing was what VAG did - gave thes the newes. He gave those to them so they would know then, not to use then. They appear not to have heard Fidel's speech yesterday which was very clear on this.
About the fighting, attacks on U.S. Embassies, public protesta, etc. - all public protests. Yes, but Johnson is still spitting on the floor and kicking, VnG says.
Nisic is writing a commentary on the political implications, what this signifies in the Dominican Republic and all of America. Niric aaya about the other source - the oue above (U.S.) -

However, they transmitted it with names and said that these were guerrillas of 14 de Junio group in the mountains. They mid this is doing a lot of barm. Aska MO to send a cable that 14 de Junio piovesent denied that there are guerrillas... Say that in enthusiasm this was a sistake. This is very urgent. Also advise kedio Habana to suspend all mention te id de Juuto, of Juan 2. Mejia and Victor Rico Golan. And so call 45.

## 23.2
In. Long distance operator with VRG who answers. Call goes through. VAG with Fundora, Juan B. Mejia called from Santo Domingo - called another Dominican here and agked them to suspend the transmissions zention of Mejia and Rico Galan. This is doing a lot of damage. Their line is the Constitutionalise and no mentica should be made of 14 de junio (Communist movement). Alan 14 de Jucio Movesent officially denies that there are guerrillas. They have to deny this. Reaction a uses all these things to say that this a Costrist subversion. The xxxxsirsax people only get information from aadio Habana and thrase these things against them and name of Actie is dyasuite.
VAG gives the information give to him by Cordero to fumiara... as previously set out. MO can say that information came frea a Constitutionalist Director to Dominican exiles in Mexico.

2.0 Out to 31-06-06. Victor Kico Galan (v -VKG) with אאאאא SINHYUN, who answers. VRG is not clear about something. YnG heard Fidel's speech yesterday. VLG wants me to know: "Mexico established that at the latest may 10, mais asks the Commission to submit to the meeting(members) a report on the progress of its works, includinga its conclusions and recommendations which it considers appropriate, at the latest of 10 Nay of 1965 and decides to celebrate a session of the meeting (7) the 11th (of May)." Was this the plan of resolution? In the plan that Sinovas read there is no date mentioned. VAG says Mexico's proposal is dated, but on the other hand, an AP cable from Washington stated that the O.6.A. suspended tax ite sessions inde- finitely tonight. What VAG wants to know is whether Mexico's proposal was approved? No, it was not approved. It was stated that it would be taken into account and their next session would be scheduled after the Commission submits its report. But if the time limite set by Mexico is not approved, the Commission can extend this and give its report in a year. Yes, in 5 years, if they want. VKG was not clear on this. Everything was left open. There is no time period or any limit on the decision. The decision was to send this Commission, wich Micic comments is very strangely made of (the members are strange)..

VRG says it is a group of gorillas. Yes. When they submit their report they will see (what happens).

VRC is now writing and wanted to ask Miric about this.

The actions of the civilians is gaunant practically finished, that is, that in official text. These troops are supposed to protect the O.E.A, Commission. The U.S. troops have taken over all the combat lines of Wessin, to continue the light.

3.7 in. wo, calling for Elizondo, asks Inge, who sawaso, for VAG. Inge asks if this was Cato calling? Yes. aren't they going over these? VRG said he would go by there at noontime. Did not men- tion it. Will put VAG on.

VlNG takes the phone. Saya he can't go because be is waiting on za call from Santo Domingo, nadio Habana pulled a real boner. They made VLC their correspondent in this mesa (of Dominican Republic). VRG has been without sleep for 2 nights. Can't call through the U.S. since they don't put his cell through since it goes through New York, 80 VKG bes to wait on calls from these. Not a boner, but gord. Yes, it is good. VAG has to write the editorial and article today too. They will see tomorrow at the office of "Siempre." Fine, wo da Tonio.

VKG taken the phone. They (Dominicans) left a communique, but it is the same thing that VKG gave Miric this morning. VRG sent then away because he has to do some writing. They (Dominicans) are making a call - especially to the Third World. It says: We are calling desperately, in the name of the Dominican people, always willing to sacrifice, na to all the peoples wixaxaxed and lovers of peace in the world, to instruct their delegates in the United Nations to defend a sister country criminally an aggravated. we coll especially the non-alineated countries (countries not following U.S. lines) which have so many times have feit in their side the weight of the imperialist boot. We demand the fraternal support of the countries which croate their own destiny under socialism - convinced that speace is for all and za imperialism the common enemy, 18 Imperialist aggression must be stopped in the agrieved Dominican people. It is signed by:
Dr. Emilio Cordero Michel, Dr. marcio mejla dicart, Ing. Leandro Guzman, Dr. Tobias Cabral Mejia and Rason Bailio Colombo - in the nase of the Dominican exiles in Mexico.

Has VixGhad news from the North (U.S.)? No, has had people there. There is an evident effort, through the news they are anitting, to pacifs latin American. They are now speaking of naming a Provisione1 President. Also have asid that I se A. Mora has set with wesain, after taiking to rebel chiefs, to seck a formula, apparently they say, hased on the proposals of the rebels. Miric comments that this is at least a confession (that they are in the right). Also it is de said that su armistice, cease firing, has been achieved between marines and rebels. They are trying to support the O.E.A, Commission. According to figures, all civilians have been evacuated. They are having a meeting thia afternoon with their Ministers and Cnugress acabers. It was add that the meeting was not very urgent. Nothing was mentioned about the disembarkation of more marines and goldiera. And...ind. declared that the Uominican people should have opportunity to choose their destiny, political development, liberty, etc. Mizic thinks this shows a to pacify Latin American.

Yes. Marcio said he was going to take them that (communique). VAG called Miric, but had already given him the information and also gave him the Call (for help). Miric said he would transmit this. He heard Radio Habana and they transmitted the "other" correctly. They did not deny the other.

He talked to Arnedo. Said a friend of his called from Santo Domingo. They are looking for a provisional Tresidant. The Voice of U.S. stated this. They want a Provisional President to have someone with whom to talk. They talked to the Constitutionalist Directers and will and talk to Hessin - proposing the Constitutionalist conditions. Miric says that the Voice of U.S. is trying to calm the opinion of Latin American and Miric is a good observer. VKG thinks they (U.S.) will continue with occupation but they are trying to smooth things over. There should be no great change. Miric thinks there way be a big change. taat VRG says that HO knows hos Yugoslavs think - they think that the words come out true. VAG thinks it may be possible for them to take (in) Bosch, but with occupation - to leave him tied up (by troops).

VAG says they (Here) don't have information on the world re-action (os Dominican Rep), but it must be very hard (against U.S.). VAG is going to call Jardon to find out what there is. Aska VAG to let him know. When he knows anything, will let him know.

to mexico.
Does miric as have anything (reaction) from Europe? Nothing press-wise, but M. has the impression that there is reaction - also with Vietnam, perhaps less British press. Miric listend a little to Moscow radio - in Spanish. Say a lot of silly things. Bring out a lot of Socialist Popular Party...silly things. That is post stupid policy. VKG says that radio Habana committed the same error (by pointing out the Communist Party as being active). Pointed out 14 de June (Party).
VKG gave them the complete info but thought they were to filter it. Had to call them today to tell them about this. The U.S. efforts to pacify public opinion in south (South America) and there is a contrast...
They say that there are about 58 communists and give their names, origin etc. over the radio. One is a Spaniard, one is a correspondent of "Prensa Latina" there (in Dominican Republic)...but AP says that there are 18,000 armed (people)- military and civilians. They will see the results of the O.E.A. Commission. VKG says they have infrasmaxx to foresee things a little. Miric points out with the visit of this Com- mission is really an approval of the intervention.

VKG is in bed. Has not slept in 48 hours. Will try to sleep. Has to write early tomorrow.

Viric will hand in about 10 pages of cable text. He is working on this. He is including in this the commentary which Miric mentioned today on political situations, the results, etc.
When can they talk tomorrow? VKG wants to exchange impressioni with Miric. VKG is going to "Siempre" early. Miric has ante "second order" things to resolve early tomorrow, but won't take long.

16.5 Out to 30-07-31. VKG asks WO, who answers, for Dr. (Emilio) Cordero. Not there right now. Nothing urgent.

16.7 Out to 25-80-32. VKG with WO, who answers, for Dr. (Emilio) Cordero.
EC takes the phone. VKG says there is nothing od "Preusa Latina." They are beginning transmission and will have something later, but VKG is going to sleep now. Mostly because this call will probably come in early tomorrow.

VKG also talked to Miric again. He is going to send all his info out by cable, (tonight) - 10 pages. They will talk tomorrow. VKG says the Habana line is not working, so can't pass anys info that EC might give him (in case EC gets a call from Santo Domingo) until tomorrow.

VNG thinks that it was a very intelligent thing to no-inste
Camagno es Provisional President. 40 comented this last night with
some friends (Dominicana) - mentioned that Ca-agno would be President.
He is the only one who can guarantee the U.S. sithough he has parti-
cipated with great ustionalism." But he is a Friend (ind? - to U.S.).
He is the only one who can guarantee a baska for the U.S. for negotia-
tions VAG axes agrees. And to resolve that situation (in Dominican
Republic) which has world resonance.

There is one xixx thing that LC does not like "about him"
(Camagno) or "the father of his." VRG saw that. "That than
there are communists (there)...under his control." VRG of course does
not like him because he is a military man. Yes, but he is only a Pro-
visional President. Bosch does not say when he will return eithes.
He should already be back there. (Wanted Bosch to come back and ta
ever.) MO does not think that he (Camegun) will obtain their proposals.
VAG does not think so either. Bosch' people may hand in arms voluneari-
ly tut the people of Is (de Junio) and the and CE - will have to kill
them to take their arms away.

Kadio Moacom was also saying a lot of silly things - in ite
Spanish transmission that the "glorious PCP heads the Анна Dominican
A lot of ball. 40 aaya these are "co-sades" but no PCP boys there.

Yes, and they even heve a program for the Dominicans - nove program.

Did VRG see "Time" Hagasing today? No. Buy it. It mecutions
3 companions of the Committee of 14 de June. But ang og embers of
the 14 de Junion group, but as Communist Directore - Jaime Duren,

Tomeija (ph). This one is member of PCP: Yes, T. la
cue of the Directors. And Grubel also wember of ICP who was also in
Prague (??ind). VAG also knows him. There is a int of news on Ameri-
caus. Also has some photos. It is most reactionnary,..,968
thinga that they are sorry in (that is, gomeone in Cube) that the
Cubans had crossed from Cuba in boats, etc...a lot of silly things...

the duty of alluding to these. The Mexican Goft, is united in the
conviction that the Dominicans and only the Dominicana are the ones
to decide on their for of govt and in general on their future - without
any intefference. (with these words there was a tremendous applause.)
Direct or indirect, open or hidden (interference) from outside.

VRG says it is good. But what why is Carrillo Flores and
de la Colin have been acting like s.o.b.'s. Miric says Carrillo Flores
arrived quite some time before the www ceremony began and someone
asked what is going to be done. And CF said that the position of
Mexico is well-known and fire, and if necessary, there will be an am-
plification (in sense of declaration). Miric expects something tonight.
VKG thinks the only thing to do is to break with the O.E.A. Yes, but
President says in his speech - expresses the confidence of Mexico that
the present..be overcome and rightpereaffirmed. But where? He expeesser
the most fervent desire that the return to the Dominican
Republic. Miric says, further, that the colleagues who cover this
souce (the Presidency) that something will come out today. VRG is
expecting a declaration. Pajes asked VRG for his article, but VAG
is expecting something. Should be something before 2100.

Miric asks about Pa jea - about Victor Alba referred to in
the issue...VKG has not seen it. DidVRG see an article in "Excelsior"
A few days ago against Yugoslavie. Yes. This is the same thing.
Micic does not understand why Pajes did the same thing, accept this.
Of Pedro Pages, the Spaniard. The article was probably agready in
when the other article was published in "Excelsior," because that
man writes 20.000 articles. Don't say anything to Pages, but Viric
does not understand for what this reasna la...

Perhaps they can get together tomorrow.

Miric got official declaration of his country, but it was
very utiliated by radio from Tanyue to Informes. Coulda's be used.
However, they express their moral support (for Dominican opublic).
VKG says this should be expressed in United Nations. Asks if YRG
gave this info to the boys (Dominican exiles). Yes.

Miric will leave very early tomorrow...will be busy with
CEPAL for next few days...VG will write his article in the morning

OY LIELEGANT AND CURTIS ON NIGHT 19 FEBRUARY,

A LIKAMA VOLUNTEERED THAT HE HAD CANCELLED THE PENEX

CONTRACT WHICH PASCUAL GUTIERREZ ROLDAN (FORMER DIRECTOR OF

PEMCR) HAD SIGNED WITH THE SOVIETS. THIS CONTRACT WAS FOR

EQUIPMENT AND, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. LIRAMA SAID THE TURBO-

WOULD BE THE ONLY PART OF THE CONTRACT ALLOWED.

9. LILLEGANT GAVE LIRAMA A BRIEF ΝΕΡΟ, ΟΝ ΤΗΣ FONDO

DE CULTURA ECONONICA AND ITS DIRECTOR ABSALDO ORFILA REYNAL...

THIS DISCUSSED BRIEFLY BY DAJUULD AND LILLEGANT ON 4 F5.

MENO PREPARED BY STATION, TRANSLATED BY LIENVOYS, LINAMA SAID

THIS A "REAL COINCIDENCE" SINCE SOME SIX WEEKS AGO HE HAD

ACKED ANTONIO ORTIZ SENA, MINISTRY OF TREASURY. TO GET RID

OF ORSILA REYNAL AS DIRECTOR OF FOE "SICE ORFILA IS A CONSIS!".


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 277

E ASKED LIELEGANT TO INCULDE ORFILA REYHAL ON HIS STUDY OF "DENATURALIZATION POSSIBILITIES" AND SAID IF DENATURALIZED ORFILA REYNAL VOULD BE "RETURNED TO HIS DATIVE ARGENTINA". HE HAD ASKED THAT SALVADOR ANZUELA (WHO FAVORABLY KNOWN OF BY STATION) BE PUT IN AS DIRECTOR OF FCE. HE ADDED THAT NOW, HOWEVER, PEOPLE WOULD THINK ORFILA REYNAL FIRED BECAUSE FCE PUBLISHED "THE CHILDREN OF SANCHEZ" BY OSCARA LEWIS WHICH HAS CREATED GREAT DEAL ADVERSE MEXICAN COMPENT.

C. CONCERNING THE HEWSPAPER EXCELEIOR (WHICH LIELEGANT RAISED) LIRAMA SAID HE DID NOT BELIEVE THE FIGHT WAS BETWEEN PRO AND ANTI COMKUBISTS. HE SAID THERE WERE SOME "TOO FAR RIGHT" INCLUDING ONE OR TWO MEMBERS OF "LOS TECOS" RIGHT WING CATHOLIC GROUP. WE BELIEVED THE FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF EXCELSIORS VOULD COME OUT ALL RIGHT.

D. LIRAMA THEN MENTIONED THAT MANUEL ESPINOSA IGLESIAS AND GABRIEL ALARCON, WHO FOUNDING "EL HERALDO" NEW MEXICAN DAILOF "RIGHT", HAVE CLAIMED THEY HAVE LIRAMA BACKING. HE SAID HE HAD BEEN ADVISED BUT WAS NOT INVOLVED, HE DESCRIBED ALARCON AS "CONTRABANDISTA" AND GANGSTER".

VICTOR RICO GALAN (P01-3364711)

1.  DPOB: 6 February 1928, El Ferrol, Spain. Subject, Spanish by birth, became a Mexican citizen by naturalisation on 15 March 1949.

2.  CIVIL STATUS: Subject is married to Ingeborg DIENER de Rico.

3.  ADDRESS: Providencia 930, Mexico City, D.F. Telephone number as of September 1964: 23 07 92. This phone is registered in the name of his mother-in-law, Tilli PICHISR viuda de Diener, whose address is also Providencia 930.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 281

4.) OCCUPATION: Writer for Siempre and Politica magazines in Mexico City; both are effective Communist-lining magazines and have large circulations.

5.) PHOTOGRAPH: Available in Subject's 201 file (date of photograph approximately October 1963).

6.) POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS AND INCLINATIONS: As of 1962 Subject was the head of the National Press and Propaganda Committee of the National Liberation Movement (MLN) in Mexico City, a rabidly anti-U.S. and pro-Castro organization. Subject is close to Fidel Castro and company, and is considered as a Cuban "agent" (degree of Cuban control unknown).

Subject was a founding member of the MLN. In an article in Siempre in March 1963 he advocated the foundation of a new political party reflecting the ideology of General Lazaro Cardenas, former President of Mexico. This would have provided, in his belief, the Mexican left a political organization truly responsive to the radical tendencies of the 1910 revolution. This was necessary because the MLN, whose membership covers the spectrum of Mexican Communist Party to PRI, could not take/political stands without antagonizing some of the membership. The new party would have represented a "third position", socialism in internal affairs and independence of any bloc in international affairs. With a party such as this as its political action arm, the MLN would have developed naturally into a broad national movement such the FRAP in Chile. (Some specious reasoning here).

Ingeborg Diener de RICO Galan, Subject's wife, traveled from Mexico to Cuba in November 1962. Subject was in Cuba


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 283

8.) PASSPORT: formally carried, Subject Mexican passport number 57115, with Cuban courtesy visas. On 9 September 1963 Subject was issued Mexican passport number 56341 (or 53611).

9.) ACTIVITIES: The reason for the October 1962 trip to Cuba was ostensibly to gather material for a political biography of Fidel Castro. The May/June 1963 trip was to interview Fidel Castro after his return from the Soviet Union. Subject claimed that he had spent eight days with Fidel during that visit, five of those aboard ship.

In Panama City
On 24 October 1963 HYSAGE-1 reported that Subject had received an operational assignment from Castro (during the May/June 1963 visit to Habana) on which to travel through Central and South America. His mission was to persuade leftist parties to immediately begin acts of sabotage and violence, and to try to maintain these in order to take pressure off Venezuela. Subject was also instructed to bring about better unity among competing leftist factions to ensure greater impact for their work. Subject did, in fact, contact many Communist Party and leftist leaders during his Central and South America travel during the period October 1963 - January 1964. From the (fregreeniday) reporting on subject now October 1965 Thiest, January 1964 it appiairs that he did discuss the question of ligitiinity.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 284

10. In October 1964 the Guatemalan authorities captured a number of tape recordings from the guerrillas in operations subsequent to a (uerrilla attack on a garrison in Panzos, Alta Verapaz. Included in those tapes was one made by RICO Galan for delivery to the guerrillas. It consists mainly of an exhortation for unity (among the POT and the 13 November group) and counsel against letting doctrine replace action. The tape clearly reveals, RICO to be at once a very *intellectual*/leftist who also has his feet planted quite firmly on the ground. His approach is pragmatic, not theoretical, The text of the tape indicates that it was made sometime after/February and before mid-October 1964.

11. There is little at hand to indicato what manner of man is RICO Galan, His 201 file reflects facts but not impressions. He apparently is known personally by LICOOKY-1 and LITAMIL-9 in Mexico City, and these two sources should be queried.

ABSTRACT INDEX

FROM DAINOLD

1. WE ARE STILL MOST DESIROUS OF EXPLOITING RICO GALAN TAPE. DESPITE MEXI PESWING OBJECTIONS TO SURFACING IN MEXICO, WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO START BURNING RICO AND THEREFORE URGE GUAT STATION TO MAKE STRONG APPROACH TO GUAT GOVT TO SURFACE LOCALLY. PERHAPS ESPILL ONE OR EVEN PERALTA IF NECESSARY WOULD BE BETTER CHANNEL FOR THIS THAN MINCOV SERRANO. SINCE GUATS RAISED SUBJECT OF TAPE DURING RECENT MINISTERS MEETINGS, THEY PRESUMABLY WOULD BE AMENABLE NOW TO LOCAL SURFACING.

2. ONCE SURFACING ACCOMPLISHED GUAT, WE WILL BE IN POSITION TO EFFECTIVELY EXPLOIT NOT ONLY TAPE ITSELF BUT ALSO OTHER KNOWN INFO ON RICO GALAN ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT HEMISPHERE ON BEHALF CASTRO REGIME.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director, for Plans

SUBJECT: Briefing of Reader's Digest Reporter

1. The Mexico City Station has been requested by the Press Office of the Embassy to assist in briefing Mr. Robert Struthers, a roving reporter of the Reader's Digest, who is preparing an article on Cuban/Communist subversion in Latin America and who has expressed displeasure that the Embassy has been unable to provide any briefing on Communist activities in Mexico and Central America.

2. Mexico City Station and WH Division feel that particularly since the Spanish edition of the Reader's Digest has a circulation of over two and one-half million copies, this is an excellent avenue for the otherwise planned surfacing of abundant information (including the existence of a tape recorded speech to Guatemalan guerrillas, recently captured) on Victor RICO Galan, an active Cuban agent and a regular contributor of the weekly leftist magazine, SIEMPRE.

3. A briefing on the activities of Victor RICO Galan and a replay of the tape has already been given officially in Guatemala during the January meeting of the Security Ministers of Central America. No press play has yet been made.

4. CA/Propaganda defers to you for a policy decision. There are no RI traces on Mr. Robert Struthers. Struthers is favorably known to Mr. Paul Chretien's office which has personality and professional data on him.

5. WH Division recommends that you release the attached cable.

## With Guatemala's

### Guerilla Fighters

"'ERE'S a rifle and bullets for you. You'll need them if we encounter the enemy. We probably won't; we're following secret trails known to us alone and, by way, the soldiers rarely come up into the mountains. Soon you've got to be ready for battle at any moment. You'll be depended on it now. Our life is very precious has to be to defend himself. That means he has to have a rifle..."

Those were the first words I heard from a patrol of "El Negro", leader of a guerrilla detachment. That was at two o'clock of a raw winter morning last year. To reach the patrol my guide and I traversed through large areas of green and barren terrain, to the top of the mountains. My guide was a travelling march. We climb down dozens of hills and steep places, blazed a trail through a vast forest trees fifty me- tres or one or three metres in breadth. It seems before day in this mountain, we equalized the river. And that is the symbol of our freedom, which cannot be in captivity. We walked along mountain streams, rows of trees concatenated be- fore rolling time along march.

We reached a quiet time on the way. Rising with the sun, we wielded up our hammocks, put our kits in order, breakfast and remain a quiet spot. At noon we stopped for supper and then marched on until five o'clock in the evening, leaving time to prepare a company, placed, held on one examine its end make a meal before dark. Suppers were our time for sleep.

months hence. On completing the training & control, most of them will work on repairing the transmission line of Caracas, Venezuela.

In other news, in the Caro Al- Akbar the Minister for the Aswan H. Dam, Sofi Soliman, has named four dams which the Aswan project has already brought the country. The failings of the reservoir has be- en enormously over 5,000 million cubic metres of water. By the end of the year that amount will be counted. This enables new irrigation to be undertaken.

The danger of flood disasters has been permanently removed. Last year proved that the dam can control even the highest Nile waters.

The old Aswan power plant, 4 miles below the High Dam, now operates without seasonal fluctua- tions.

Valuable fertile soils have been trained to use the project, people have been taught skills and supportably. Many foreigners are shooting on the High Dam are now doing a good job elsewhere.

Back in Cairo from Aswan, I went to find out how the water works to decide the High Dam will be used. For the five years beginning since 1965, after the dam, as a number of new soil will be expanded by 173,000 hektares and will be 1085 across hektares. 178,000 hektares of new soil by 1976. In addition, 30,000 hektares are going to get personnel training of the project more grow are recognized that they will take place 30,000 a year.

At the end of the U.A.R. a only step ahead over 6 million felakes, Iowan a time- nation importance for her pupils agri- culture stand still very uneasy. And Value then over construction project will take another two years to complete the. And will already harvest dam are under the first crop from new areas.

A young man who only yesterday had also still been a student. De- spite his youth he has already prov- en himself a staunch revolutionary. All were well outfitted and well armed: tommy guns, rifles, full car- tridge belts, pistols, hand grenades- the "teeth" of the enemy, as the guer- rillas call their bayonets. Looking at their conversation, emaciated faces, 1. Could see that their life in the mountains must be pretty radical.

After a cold breakfast-no fire was made for safety's sake-my guide waited back for the village and we went on to join the detachment. It was a two-days' march. We climb be- low down dozens of hills and steep places, blazed a trail through a vast forest trees fifty me- tres or one or three metres in breadth. It seems before day in this mountain, we equalized the river. And that is the symbol of our freedom, which cannot be in captivity. We walked along mountain streams, rows of trees concatenated be- fore rolling time along march.

The patrol consisted of five men. These were a doctor, two parents and a student under the command of

minories of life, of falue.
Dre and triends We reached the do-
tachmenta camping grounds towa.d's
evening of the third day. That day
we had a hot meal. It was iny first
"guerilla" dinner -soup, roast squir-
rel (very tasty, I must say) and, of
course, coffee. I spent several days
with the guerillas, learning to know
these brave patriots, their habits,
aspirations, ideals and plans.

***

The commander of the detach-
ment-for understandable reasons I
omit his name-is a 23-year-old of-
ficer who after graduating from the
Military Academy, attended a Yan-
"anti-guerilla warfare"
training centre. His patriotic feeling
moved him to go over to the side of
the people and devote himself heart
and soul to the struggle for their
interests. Before joining the gueril-
las he was one of the leaders of the
Alejandro de Leon November 13th
Movement, so named in honour of
an armed uprising in November 1960
of a group of democratically-minded
officers against the venal Ydigoras
Fuentes government, the uprising
was suppressed and Alejandro de
Leon, one of the insurgent officers
who continued the struggle, was
murdered by the secret police agents.
The detachment command is both
militaryscientific and lovingly re-
spected and respected by his commandens in arms and by the people of the nearby village. The
same people who venal military
police agents hate him intensely.
It is more than a year now that
only learned to read and write in the
Condeca(on), at the art walas of life,
occupational and political views and
other related felanda. There are
men from 25 to 50. But whether
leader or peasant, Communist
Party, all of them are united
ardent desire to rid the coun-
try of its age-old backwardness and
by a monopoly domination.

At detachment they have taken the
name of Ildar Palacios, a popular
student leader. Besides being a lead-
er of the United Front of Guatema-
Inn Students, Ibarra was a member
of the Communist youth organiza-
tion and the Vanguard of Patriotic
Worker Youth. Everywhere, in the
university, in street demonstrations,
in clashes with the police, he infused
a revolutionary spirit in the student
movement. One of the first civilians to
join the guerilla forces, he was killed
in one of the battles fought by the
Alarto Planos detachment. Now the
detachment is name after him and
the members have joined with
other troops to form a sin-
gle unit-the Armed Rebel Forces.
From the first the Edgar Ibarra
guerillas completed their military
operations, they work among the
peasants in the neighbouring villages.
On their tours, to win them over
state to them back and to teach reading
and writing to whole families. They
have won over the total support of
the peasants. While I was with the
guerillas, one of them told me:

"We based the operation on de-
tailed information gathered by our
contacts in the village over many
days and then carefully analyzed it.
concerned the exact location of our
targets, the approaches to the power
plant and to the village. We drew a de-
tailed map of the locality and a

![map of Guatemala, Escuintla, Honduras, and El Salvador with the Pacific Ocean on the left and Caribbean Sea on the right]

Guatemala's forest trade is conducted,
passes a few kilometres away from
it. The Atlant route, linking the
capital with these parts, also passes
it. Just outside it are the dam and
the main installation of the Rio
Hondo hydroelectric station, which
supplies current to the capital, Zaca-
pa and Chiquimula departments.
Large army and police forces always
guard this vital zone. A military unit
and a police detachment are per-
manently quartered in Rio Hondo.
Through conversations and perspec-
tives, answers and to arrive at a clear
assessment seeks to know the dis-
content of the people in this part of
the country. Nevertheless, it is here,
in this zone that the guerilla move-
ment is spreading.

One of the guerilla commanders
told me about an operation the guerillas
had carried out in Rio Hondo:

"We based the operation on de-
tailed information gathered by our
contacts in the village over many
days and then carefully analyzed it.
concerned the exact location of our
targets, the approaches to the power
plant and to the village. We drew a de-
tailed map of the locality and a
same operation occurred in a house in it
will come in details.

Rio Hondo is a small populated
town in Zacapa department, in the
country. From west to east runs
a street to enter Teculutan and El Progreso. From the parts on which the detach-
ment has been in the
members come from
various parts of the country. From
the capital, from Escuintla and other
cities, from the Verapaz, Santa Rosa,
Zacapa and Izabal provinces. They
are workers and peasants, students
and craftsmen and intellectuals
of different intellectual levels come

north from coffee plantations, rant a deshower over which every- thing from coffee to minerals is transported. From Panima cargoes are shipped via Reuchie and Dulce r v- ers and Lake Izabal to Santo To- mas and Puerto Barrias, there to be transferred to American ships. Pano was the site of another operation carried out by the Edgar Ibarra de- tachment. The guerillas occupied it and then retreated without bearing any losses.

The government was compelled to issue na official announcement that "malefacoses" had seized a conside rable quantity of arms and that troops had been sent out after them with orders to bring them back "dead or alive." Tas official announce- ment was significant. Until then tise government had dermed the existence of a guerilla movement in Guate- mala, now its existence was recogniz ed as a fact.

Much as they worked to die one- son could not be dull. To fact that a battle had been between guerillas was the local garrison, in which the torrona had suffered losses Besides its evening captured a troop of government sol- diers in Panima and, as in Rio Hon- des explained before releasing them: "Its not you we are punishing. You are poor men like ourselves. You have the same hopes we have. We are fighting the oppressive regime set up in our country by a handful of army colonels in the interests of the Yankees."

Whenever the oppressive offers the guerillas explain the aims of their struggle to the saldives of the regular army. These aims are set forth in detail in the Manifesto is- sued by the Armed Rebel Forces in Novemos” 12. Cosa Rica now it are these lines: "We want a real revo- lution, not merely change of govern- ment. It is not a matter of replacing one set of rulers by another, for then two people would be to be masticated, as has repeatedly been the case in the history of Venezuela. It is a matter of the fundamental renovation of the republic"

The guerilla program, it must be said, falls on fertile soil.

When I left the poor mountain. I heard in farewell those words from our na- tional anthem: "Win or die." The words are now the battle cry of the Armed Rebel Forces Back in the city I plunged once again into the activities of the underground resistance movement, but this stayed with me the memory of the men of the Via Icara'a d him, the soldiers of the one front of a struggle against the oppressors of my people.

PREACHING FROM "SIEMPRE" PODIUM. THIS PICE COULD DOVETAIL SMOTHLY IN USE REF RICO GALAN GUAT ACTIVITIES.

D. REF TAPE AS EXAMPLE EXISTING EVIDENCE OF A MEXICAN (RICO GALAN IS SPANISH-BORN BUT NATURALIZED) INTERFERING IN GUAT INTERNAL POLITICS PROVIDES KUBARK WITH OPPORTUNITY FOR PSYCH OP WHICH WILL COMPLEMENT AMMUG REPORT AND WHICH GOM CANNOT DUCK, PRESUMING SURFACING IN THIRD COUNTRY.

2. SUGGEST HQS AND GUAT CONSIDER FOLLOWING: THAT REF RICO CALAN ACTIVITIES AGAINST GOG BE SURFACED GUAT, INCLUDING STATEMENT THAT TAPE EXISTS. THAT HAS THEN ARRANGE PASS SPLENDID LINLUCK MATERIAL (WHICH ALREADY PREFARED IN FORM OF NEW STORY) TO PBPRIME JOURNALIST.

THIS STORY COULD TREA DE EXPIDITED TWNDIGHOUT HEMISPHERE CALISI E:WARRASSMENT TO GOM, WHICH WOULD THEN DE ALMOST FORCED TAKE ACTION AGAINST RICO GALAN AND POSSIBLY "SIEMPRE". (AND AT THAT TIME THERE NO REASON STATION COULD NOT FASS REF TAPE TO COM TO RELIEVE ANY DOUBTS IT NIGHT HAVE CONCERNING RICO GALAN'S CONPLICITY WITH PRAUMEN).

1. Des√¶ription:

A organization formed in New York City on 22 March 1961 under the guidance of the U.S. Government for the purpose of unifying the various exile groups in the U.S. File smacks of exile disappointment in U.S. Government's policy which seemed to abandon plans to liberate Cuba. (See attached.) Material concerns resignations, coalitions, agreements, in-fighting, political aspirations of the various players,. organizational structure and financing.

2. Findings:

WAVE 6617 (IN 98730) dated 1 April 1963:

Cable from WAVE to Headquarters. Stated that the exile colony is in an uproar over notices to the Cuban exile action leaders prohibiting travel outside of Dade County. Reaction among exiles appears universal over this issue and was anti-U.S. and anti-Kennedy. Even though notices only sent to selected leaders, the order was interpreted as applicable to all exiles and the beginning of co-existence.

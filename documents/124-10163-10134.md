CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20505

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Attention: Mr. S. J. Papich

FROM : Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT : Adolph Jay ALBRECHT

1. Adolph Jay ALBRECHT, born 15 June 1926 in New Jersey, is an industrial advertising copywriter currently residing in Stockholm, Sweden. The holder of U.S. passport No. D 294080, issued 18 April 1963 at New York City, Subject served with the United States Navy from about 1947 to 1955, on active duty for only two weeks, however. As of November 1963 Subject said he was employed by the Andersson and Lembke Advertising Agency, Luntmakargaten 95, Stockholm.

2. On 29 November 1963 Subject, of his own volition, visited the American Embassy in Stockholm and asked to speak with the embassy "security officer." He was interviewed by a representative of this Agency[^5] Subject said that a former girlfriend, Charlotte ABERG (Swedish citizen, born_ca. 1943), told him that Karl-Erik RIDDERSTRALE (Swedish citizen, born 24 September 1922), while drunk on 15 November 1963, predicted that within two weeks President KENNEDY would be assassinated while on a trip among his own people. Following the assassination Charlotte was upset and called ALBRECHT on 27 November 1963 to inform him of RIDDERSTRALE's statement made while he was visiting Charlotte and her mother on 15 November. Charlotte described RIDDERSTRALE as normally quiet and refined and one of her mother's suitors. According to Subject, RIDDERSTRALE, though wealthy and a member of Swedish nobility, is a left winger and strong supporter of Fidel CASTRO.

3. Through Subject, arrangements were made for Charlotte ABERG to be interviewed at the American Embassy on 4 December 1963. Charlotte related substantially the same story as did Subject, with minor contradictions. She said RIDDERSTRALE's comments were made about ten days before the assassination and that he had not given a two-week deadline; he merely said, "soon." She said she knew nothing about RIDDERSTRALE's background. Charlotte was advised to report the foregoing to Swedish authorities. Following an interview with Swedish police officials, Charlotte returned to the American Embassy on 9 December 1963.

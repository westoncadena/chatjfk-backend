MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Operations Support Branch

FROM: (Joseph P. Mirabile)
Operations Support Branch

SUBJECT: SHERMAN, Adrian Fisher, Jr. #54 621

1. On 25 September 1978, a call was received in the Security Duty Office from James A. Sherman, Subject's brother, advising that Subject suffered a fatal heart attack on 23 September 1978 at his apartment in Monterey, California. Subject was sixty years of age and had a history of previous heart trouble.

2. Mr. Sherman was previously of interest to this Agency as a military detailee, 1952 - 1954, when he was serving at Clark Air Force Base, the Philippines, as a Major in the United States Army. After leaving the Army, he worked for Pan American Airlines for approximately 13 years and then as an investigator for the State Attorney General's Office in Miami, Florida. He has been of interest to DCD and FRD in San Francisco, California, since April 1977. FRD's operational interest was as an access agent to a Saudi Arabian of interest to the San Francisco Base.[^24]

3. On 23 September 1978, Subject's body was discovered by an FRD case officer who had arrived at the Monterey, California, apartment for an operational meeting. The apartment house resident manager gained access to the apartment. Subsequent access was allowed to an emergency ambulance squad, police officers and the deputy coroner.

4. Assistance has been rendered to FR Base by San Francisco Field Office personnel in this matter. (Gordon Gregory) SAC/SFFO, was apprised on the circumstances on 25 September 1978 and subsequently made contact with the Chief, FR Base. Subject's son, who was traveling cross- country by auto at the time of the death, arrived in the area on 27 September with two sisters and was contacted by a representative of the San Francisco Field Office. He is

reported to be very cooperative, aware of need for discretion and secrecy and proud of his father's relationship with this Agency.

5. The only aspect of this incident, which may be of continuing security concern, is that the son recalls that in May 1978, while assisting his father in moving some personal effects, he remembers seeing. a written plan to assassinate Fidel Castro. The son said that it had been prepared by his father in the early 1970's when he was working in Florida but at a time when he had no Agency association. At this time the paper is still missing. It may have been recently destroyed by the Subject or, the possibility exists, it may have been stolen by someone having access to the apartment. According to Subject's son, several other items were missing, including a money clip containing a $100 bill that his father always kept, a Randall knife, a gold pen and pencil set and a microwave oven. After notifying the police of the missing personal items, Subject's son received the knife from the resident manager who claims to have found it in some weeds. Subject's son suspects that the resident manager may have been responsible sponsibl for the theft of the personal items, but he has now resolved to drop the entire issue.

6. Foreign Resources Division has advised that the DCI has been briefed on this case. It is therefore felt that no further Office of Security action is required at this time other than to monitor the case for 60-90 days to determine if any new developments occur..

OCCURRENCE:
The Special Group discussed (1) the possibility of providing sixty thousand dollars from the Cuba budget to sponsor the religious activity of Father Peyton in Cuba; (2) a proposal to survey the possibility of establishing a strike base in Nicaragua; (3) the necessity for the Defense Department to supply 38 military men to CIA. "Mr. Douglas questioned whether the present concept of 600 or 700 Cubans is any longer practicable. He said that it had been his understanding that -the-current-thinking-contemplated_figures_more_on_the_order_of 3,000." Mr. Barnes replied that the CIA believes what is required is enough individuals to serve as a rallying point for the anti-Castro elements in Cuba and thus 600 is as useful as 3,000. The CIA justified the request for 38 military men because it now believed it was necessary to train the Cubans in infantry tactics involved in a defense, in addition to the guerrilla warfare training previously contemplated.

Lansdale briefed the group on numbers of agents in Cuba. Air resupply proposal submitted by CIA "should be deferred pending broader review of the entire situation." Taylor noted if urgent need for air supply proposal could be made to the Special Group Augmented at any time. "Mr. McCone emphasized that no high-level penetra- tions of the Cuban government have yet been attained." "The Attorney General inquired about the status of popular support for Castro, and also the possibility of a revolt -against-him."_ Lansdale_replied, "There is no rallying point for active opposition."
The AG and Johnson emphasize need to obtain hard intelligence on subversive activities by Castro in the hemisphere. A complete review of MONGOOSE was set toward the end of July. Taylor emphasized need for summaries of results "and a statement of future al- ternatives open to the U.S. should be developed."

McCone said that his experts had informed him that from a legal point of view, CIA could use unvouchered funds to support an operation of this kind. He cautioned,

According to Mrs. Virginia Leitao de Cunha, she contacted Ruz and obtained Ruz agreement to provide intelligence on the Cuban political leadership and to work against the Cuban Communist regime, "short of engaging in activity which might result in direct personal charmstor her brothers Raul and Ridel." Arrangements were being made for direct recruitment of Ruz in Mexico.

OCCURRENCE: Memo for Richard Helms from Gen. Lansdale concerning *NSA* cover. The memo
alludes to a conversation on the previous day, Jan. 31, 1962, about *NSA* cover for the
Cuba Project. It indicates that Cuba cover is top priority. It indicated that this was not
possibly known to the members of the United States Intelligence Board. The problem seemed to
be to be able to decide how much of (*NSA* (National Security Agency)'s) assets were needed to
provide cover for the Cuban project.

OCCURRENCE: Helms testified that the aim of the Cuban operations was "to get rid of Castro or the Castro regime in Cuba; lets put it that way, and no limitations were placed on the means. In fact, I never recall having been told by anybody do not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The above statements refer to Mongoose.) Helms testified that "the pressure was very intense and I remember vividly it was very intense." The pressure led to several "very nutty schemes." (26) Helms testified the pressure built up to the Bay of Pigs and then lay dormant for awhile and intensified again toward the end of 1961 and 1962. The Cuban Missile Crisis itself was the period of greatest intensity. Afterwards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving "economic warfare" such as turning off oil deliveries and stopping bus deliveries including an attempt to stop the sale by the Leyland Bus Company in Spain of buses to Cuba.

meeting of foreign ministers which opened January 22, 1962. The object was to get wide
Western Hemisphere support for OAS resolutions condemning Cuba and isolating it from the
rest of the hemisphere. "The OAS meeting is to be supported by public demonstrations in
Latin America, generated by CIA and a psychological campaign assisted by USIA." The major
task_of_the_diplomatic_capability_was_to encourage Latin American leaders to develop
independent operations similar to the instant project seeking an internal revolt of the
Cuban people against the Communist regime. In the economic warfare area an embargo on
Cuban trade was to be considered after the OAS meeting. The CIA was unable to undertake
the action to sabotage the sugar harvest which commences about January 15 and upon which
Cuba's one-crop economy depended. Sabotage of transport, mills, sugar sacking in cane
fields was explored, according to Lansdale's review. Special sabotage support was noted.→

"CIA has initiated action to contaminate POL supplies for Cuba, although visible results (stoppage of some Cuban transports) is not expected until mid-1962. CIA is introducing "*Lubzol*", a corrosive additive to Cuban locomotive diesel fuel oil through commercial suppliers in Belgium. A similar project was noted for jet fuel storage tanks in Cuba. Lansdale noted that the CIA had concluded that its realistic role should be to at least create the illusion of a popular movement, to win external support for it, to improve CIA operational capability, and to help create-a-climate-which-will-permit-provocative actions in support of a shift to overaction. Lansdale wanted them to reevaluate to see whether or not they could make a greater effort. An outline of what the 33 tasks are for each of the entities involved then follows in Lansdale's memo. The memorandum notes that the President directed that the Chief of Operations conduct the project through the appropriate organizations and departments of the government. In this regard the memo notes "Also, CIA apparently believes that its role should be to create and expand a popular

In regard to Task #7 of General Lansdale's review this memo notes, "Moreover, the development of a resisitence movement will not remain controllable, so that operational time tables produced during the next four weeks can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of actions." (00107)

The memorandum notes that six men to form the initial nucleus for work for_inside_Cuba_ have-been-assessed-in-depth. Fifteen locations have been selected as suitable centers for resistence. It was also noted that in support of State's efforts, CIA has conducted pro- paganda operations_including a number of mass demonstrations in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

Approved were dispatching one intelligence agent operation to a key area selected by the CIA, ("Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained for paramilitary skills -as-well-as-intelligence-collection,...

Mr. HARVEY "gave a rundown on progress to date with agent teams and in the general field of intelligence." He said, "that three agent teams have been infiltrated."

OCCURRENCE: It was agreed that Harvey was to work towards reaching a stage in the interrogation of Pedro Roig, the Cuban economic official who defected to Mexico, where he can be surfaced to make public charges of Cuban Communist operations against Latin American nations. Harvey was to generate a story from Cuban refugee sources that the original Cardenas incident consisted of a demonstration concerning the shortage of food. This was to cause ridicule of the Communist regime's use of MIGs, tanks and troops against the unarmed people of Cardenas. "The-Guban-source-to-story need not await your determination of the true cause of the Cardenas demonstration."

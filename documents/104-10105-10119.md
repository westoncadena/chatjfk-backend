DD/0.76-3962

23 June 1976

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Counterintelligence Staff

ATTENTION: Mr. Julian Fox

FROM: Clifton R. Strathern
Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT: General Comments on Mr. David Phillips' Manuscript

REFERENCE: C/LAD Memorandum dated 22 June 1976, Citing Specific Objections to Mr. David Phillips' Manuscript

1.  The general tenor of the manuscript leaves much to be desired from both an operational and security viewpoint. The author in numerous instances specifically discloses sources, methods, cover arrangements and liaison relationships. Various LA Division officer who have reviewed portions of the manuscript pertinent to their areas have commented negatively on the revelations of tradecraft and identification of numerous overseas Stations and operations.

2.  Other objectionable items in the manuscript concern the confirmation of Agee's effectiveness in neutralizing Agency efforts abroad by publishing lists of CIA personnel in specific Stations; revelation of Office of Communications personnel in every Embassy abroad; the Agency role in countering terrorism, narcotics trafficking and training provided other services to counteract these activities; and, the specific identity of liaison relationships, particularly, (the Israeli service.)

3.  The overall concensus of this Division is that publication of this manuscript in its present form would be detrimental to the Agency and this Division in particular.

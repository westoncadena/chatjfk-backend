du Comité de coordination des
étudiants non violents (S.N.C.C.),
aujourd'hui responsable des af-
faires internationales du S.N.

en faveur du « pouvoir noir » au-
rait lieu à la Mutualité, le 29 avril
à 20 heures. Outre M. Foreman,
qui est également « ministre des

Panthères noires, MM. Aimé Cé-
saire, Daniel Guérin, Jean-Paul
Sartre et Vercors participeront
notamment à cette réunion au
cours de laquelle deux films se-
ront projetés : Now, de S. Al-
varez, et Jazz d'avant-garde.

Au cours de sa conférence de
presse, M. Foreman a évoqué « le
meurtre du pasteur King, *exemple
du génocide* » que commet
contre les Noirs américains « la
société exploiteuse blanche rac-
ciste », et l'adoption par le Con-
grès américain du projet de loi
interdisant la discrimination ra-
ciale dans le logement. Ce texte
de loi contient en effet un cer-
tain nombre de clauses répressi-
ves visant, selon M. Foreman, à
« liquider » les leaders noirs. M.
Foreman a également lancé un
appel en faveur de plusieurs
membres du parti des Panthères
noires emprisonnés à Oakland
(Californie), à la suite d'une fu-
sillade avec la police le 6 avril
dernier, qui a fait un mort - un
jeune Noir de dix-sept ans.

1. RODIGAST reports that the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King had a dramatic and profoundly disturbing impact upon the American Negro community in Paris. The young female leader of the SNCC girls in Paris flew to the U.S. several days later in order to be "where the action is." She does not plan to return but was very impressed by her stay in Paris saying that she will try to persuade other SNCC members to avail themselves of the valuable experience to be gained from working with the various revolutionary groups in Paris. As we foresaw in Reference this has left the SNCC group in the joint hands of IDENTITIES A and C of Reference. Invitations have poured in to speak at various meetings and it appears likely that IDENTITY A of will represent SNCC at many of these meetings. The importance in the Black community in Paris is indicated by the prominent place accorded her in the memorial service for Dr. King. (See under separate cover attachment 1) Needless to say, this renders all the more pressing an early decision on the proposal contained in Reference.

confusion regarding Sartre's willingness to speak. He had originally accepted to speak at a culturally oriented "gala" to be held at the Theatre National Populaire and there was a question regarding his willingness to switch to this more political atmosphere. The "gala" (see earlier report, paragraph C of OEPA-918) is now being planned for some time in May.

3. IDENTITY C of Reference is reported by RODIGAST to be working with Foreman in planning for the Mutualite meeting. She is so busy that she has temporarily left her child with her mother. IDENTITY C of Reference is also said to be working on another project-possibly involving travel which is confidential at this point.

The magazine is scheduled to be off the press around May 10. The letter clearly indicates that the SDS was behind the student seizure of Columbia University. It says, "Right now our glorious brothers have seized Columbia University--now named Malcolm X University--and over which an N.L.F. flag now flies. The others, faculty, deans, managers, are all scurrying and speaking pious--saying SDS this, SDS that, while we hold five buildings in joyousness and the most serious preparations to resist, our movement has over reached."

B. Attachment B: Letter from Heiner *BASTIAN,
1415 Kearny St., San Francisco, California 94135,
signed Heiner & Celine. BASTIAN has made arrangements
with the editor-in-chief of AKZENTE to publish works
of revolutionary poets, and he asks Margaret's
help in collecting them. BASTIAN says that he is
going to Berlin about 1 July, to Prague in early
autumn for a "group 47 meeting," and to Cuba in
early November.

C. Attachment C: Letter from Jaime *CARRERO,
Art Department of the Interamerican University in
San German, Puerto Rico. CARRERO has apparently sent
Margaret a series of drawings based on Dr. Martin
Luther KING's assassination. He describes them as
"poetic...but full with guts and disgust." He says
there is a possibility CBS will do a program on
his paintings and the work in his Art Department.
CARRERO is going to Columbia University in the
summer of 1968 to study and plans to distribute
El Corno there.

D. Attachment D: Letter from Susan *SHERMAN,
305 E. 6th St., No. 3, New York, N. Y. (see HMMA-
33837). She tells of her plans to go to StoneyBrook
on 23 April to speak about the conference for their
week of protest activities. She tells Margaret
that there are three people in Cuba she thinks
would be interested in "The Hippie Book." They are
Jose *BELL Lara, of Calle J #556, Vedado, Habana,
who is connected with Pensimento Critico; Cuban
psychologist Gustavo *TORROELLA, Ave. 3A #22,
Marianao, Habana; and Lohania *ARUCA, 99-4722,
MINREX-Direccion de Organismos Internacionales,
Depto. ONU 516, La Habana.

E. Attachment E: Margaret got a letter from
someone associated with CATERPILLAR. He is thinking
of getting married to Marie *BENOIT in England this
summer when he goes there to work in applied
philosophy. Therefore, he tells Margaret he cannot
go to Cuba as planned.

2. Attachment, F: An interesting development was the
   fact that Margaret RANDALL received a letter from Moscow from
   Luis *SUARDIAZ, whose return address was given as the Cuban
   Embassy, Moscow, URSS. SUARDIAZ asks for Suzan SHERMAN
   (see paragraph 1D above). SUARDIAZ says he will be working
   as Cultural Counselor in the Cuban Embassy and hopes Margaret
   will keep in touch with him and send him things of interest
   (in a literary line).

3. In attachment G, Sergio_MONDRAGON, Subject's husband,
   indicates that Margaret RANDALL is planning to travel to
   Venezuelge from 15 to 30 June. It is suggested that Head-
   quarters may wish to send Venezuela some background information
   on Margaret with suggestions for action by the Venezuela
   Station.

   with a tape recorder, and then, based on these tapes, will
   write her book. Sérgio suggests Doubleday as a publisher;
   however, on 25 April 1968 Paula McGuire of Pantheon Books
   (attachment I) wrote Margaret saying that publisher might be

Dear Mag!

I've received the group of Cornos #24 and 25,26. I've also sent a series of drawings based on Dr. Martin Luther King's assasination. They poetic as usual but full with guts and disgust. The US will get no whare with this killing of the bast of their sons. Your work is getting there-here- where it is needed, so keep up the excellent job you are doing since I know that you are working under a tramandous preassure. Very soon I'll send some money. Again I want ton Cornos 24- if you have any left. These drawings are getting a lot of attention especially in our younger generation which where it counts.

There is a possibility of CBS doing aprogram of what I am doing in painting and in our Art Department- if it comes through I'll put a word or two about el Corno. This is to happen -if- you know in the fall.

I'm going to New York during As juna- 'till agust-and I'll be studying at Columbia. I'll take with me some cornos to distribute. If you want to give any messages or anything that I can do in New York while there-please let me know. Bueno, Mega o, Heg-como siempre-la familia receives my beat regards and you my sincere love and efforts.

Dear Meg,

Just a nota--I'm going this afternoon to StonsyBrook to speak about the conference for their weak of protest activities. I finally got most of my things & I have a packet of poetry that I'm sure was meant for you--it was the poems Tania meant for you--it must have gotten mixed up in my things. In any case I'm sending then in a separate envelop Air-Mail.

The Hippia Book is really great looking, thank you for it. There are two people in Cuba I think would be very interested in it if you could send them copies. One works on Pensimento Critico--Jose Bell Lara, Calle J #556, Vedado, Habana--he particularly wanted information about the Hippies. The other is a Cuban psychologist Gustavo Torroella, Ave 3A #22, Marianao, Habana, who was also extremely interested in anything concerning hipppies, Also Lohania Aruca, 99-4722, MLNREX-Direccion de Organismos Internacionales, Depto. MIX ONU 516, La Habana,

It seems row as if I also have a small ulcer which showed up on last weeks X-rays, But I'm feeling much, much better now. Just have to try not to get too excited and dat at right for awhile. It should go away if I'm good. (but then I dont give myself agrivation so its only partly up to me). That was what was probably causing all the trouble in Guba. Anyway, I'm much better now. I really have to learn not to take everything so much to heart--but thats a long lesson.

I'm going to try to get the issue in shape the next few daya. will give blow by blow descriptions. so you'll probably be hearing from me quite often. Its lousy cold here again, I think Spring took a look at New York and decided to go elsewherel

Love, & more,

Susan

28 April 1968

dear Meg,

I am sorry to have put the Japanese filmmaker on you; my misjudgement. You were right to send the thing back to me.

Some changes in my life have recently re-determined the summer, and I am doubtful tonight, really doubtful for the first time (tho I have been thinking about this for a couple of weeks, but have not written because Everything was up in the air), about the trip this summer. The thing is that a more important thing has come up, namely going to England this fall to do some very important work in an applied philosophy called Scientology (to go "clear" as they call it), and doing that I must teach all summer to make money and also to do work on the fall issue of CATERPILLAR. Marie Benoit and I are seriously considering getting married in England, and while I could put the trip off until next spring, she wants to do the thing this fall, and we both want to go clear together. So, considering all of this, I think you should scratch my name, and hope I can go to Cuba later as well as hope the Cubans will see fit to invite me later (I have heard nothing from any Cubans about the trip this summer, so I figured it is not completely set).

All of the other names I sent you are still to my knowledge good. If I hear otherwise I will write you immediately.

CATERPILLAR 3/4 is out, and 3 copies are on their way to you. I will mail a box of #2 and more 3/4s when I get the time. Sorry not to hv sent more, but only 3 went out to the contributors this time and I forgot about you sending some to Cuba when I mailed yours.

Saw Sergio a few weeks ago. It was nice to see him. We had supper in Chinatown and I gave him a new poem.

A number of people have commented on your prose/poem in #3/4. Very impressive is the general word. I hope it looks good to you when you see the magazine.

I have a great deal new work; are you open to printing more of my poetry in a forthcoming EL CORNO?

I hope you are not upset my change in plans. This Sunday is the first day they have been definite. Hoping your life goes well these days,

affectionately,

querida meg:

acaban de llegarme como seis cartas tuyas juntas, con fotos, cartas de
los chics, noticias, etc. -gracias, lástima del pelo de saris, esa es una de las razones
-la única razón- por lo cual no me gusta que los chics pasen la noche en tlalpan. por la

insalubridad, estoy seguro que los piojos los toman allá muchas veces, en fin, qué mala.
noticia lo del coche. meg, no te parece que tus amigos -por lo menos dos amigos- están
tomando ventajas de ti? primero fue rodolfo, quien desaparece con la grabadora, ya la
devolvió? y ahora otro amigo te choca el coche y no te lo paga, dices que te va a costar
más de mil pesos, te parece justo? a mi no.

gracias por los ocho dólares de mi nota. cobraste mis 700 pesos de educación?
estuve en nueva york para las vacaciónes de pascua me quedé con leandro y evi, fui tam
bién a montreal y visité a los bowering. recordamos muchas cosas, hablamos horas acerca
de tiempos felices, cuando tú y yo éramos una pareja llena de amor. allí estaba maal
leonel kearms y otro posta canadiensa que hemos publicado y no recuerdo su nombre. dicen qu
e tal vez vangan pronto a méxico, en n.y. vi a los petersen. me trataron muy bien. te man
dan muchos saludos y es casi seguro que vengan a méxico en el verano, yo les invité a
quedarse en la casa, ya sea que tú estés alli o an venezuela. siendo tan amigos tuyos
creo que está bien. pero ellos alquilarán un apartamento, por lo menos la mayor parte del
tiempo. vi también a sara blackburn, mujer maravillosa con quien hice mucha amistad,
le entusiasmó la idea de tu libro sobre castro que vas a hacer en octubre con la grabadora
y me dijo que ella pouria proponer ese mismo libro a una ediotrial grande como Doubleday
o otra igual, me parece que te va a a scribir, sabes que ella tiene mucha influencia en
el mundo literario de la grandes compañías editoriales. quiero pedirte un favor para ella:
enviale el libro de o. pas "corriente alterna" a su domicilio, 50 W. 8 st., n.y.c.,10011.
cuesta como 12.00 pesos. es urgente, gracias, vi también a clayton eshelman, me invitó a
comer. está muy bien, mejor que nunca y muy amistoso. conocí también a su mujer, que
me pareció una mujer my triste, aunque buena. evi y leandro están bien. todos en n.y.
te qaieren muchoy te admiran y admiran al corno, la revista se agota en tres días en 8.
st. bookshape, andrei codrescu me dijo que debes enviar más ejemplares, tienen en la tien
da un aviso de tu libro, anunciado entre las "novedades".

felicidades por tu antología de poesía revolucionaria, y por el manus-
crito que te piden en londres, parece que una compañía grande de aquí quiere que les
haga una antologia de poesía hisp. vamos a ver qué sucedió con mi libro en el fondo?
la universidad parece que no va a publicar mi libro. mala suerte la de ese aprendiz de
brujo. angela y george están muy bien. parece que se aman mucho. angela y todos, sara,
clayton, etc., cuando digas que vas a cuba en octubre, dijeron inmediatamente que
tal vez vas a ser mrs. fidel castro, o al menos su amante. sara dijo que se moría de en
vidia. han salido más cosas del corno en los periódicos? enviame algunos recortes.
bueno, ama a los chics y cuidate, te mandé una carta hablándote de los poemas de marco
antonio, también envié ya su manuscrito de regreso, y me quedé con unos poemas suyos.
escribeme, dime si crees que los niños están resientiendo mucho la separación, y en qué
forma, abrazos y abrazos,
Sirgio

Dear Miss Randell:

My former colleague Sara Blackburn (who sends her love) has told me that she recently heard through your husband about your plans for a trip to Cuba in order to write a book on Castro. I should be very interested to know more about your plans with a view towards the possibility of publishing your book and hope you'll be able to write me.

Incidentally, we are about to publish Jose Iglesias's *In the Fist of the Revolution: Life in a Cuban Country Town*. I thought you'd be interested to read it and have sent you a copy under separate cover.

Yours sincerely,

Paula McGuire

# Stockely CARMICHAEL :

## Notre objectif final :

# Nous attaquer aux

## structures capitalistes

# des U.S.A.

Dans son numéro du Premier Mai, l'« HumanitéNouvelle », organe central du Parti Communiste Marxiste-Léniniste de France a publié une interview de Stockely Carmi- chaël, leader du « Black Power» (Pouvoir Noir). Cette interview a été réalisée par un camarade africain lors du récent séjour de Carmichael à Paris.

Le Black Power est un mouvement de masse de Afro-américains. Certaines de ces positions peuvent ne pas toujours coïncider avec celles des marxistes-léninistes mais Il est évident que le combat du Black Power est héroïque, courageusement anti-raciste, anti-impérialiste.

C'est cela qui est important: C'est pour cette raison que nous reproduisons ce re- marquable document.

> [Figure: Text describing different aspects of combativity]

**STOCKELY CARMICHAEL** — L'aspect principal de la situation du peuple afro-américain est celui d'une nouvelle forme de colonialisme intérieur. Il s'agit d'une situation presque originale qui implique que notre lutte se fixe deux objectifs principaux:

*   Objectif numéro 1 : éliminer l'oppression coloniale qui nous vise en tant que Noirs sur le triple plan économique, social et politique.
*   Objectif numéro 2 : nous attaquer aux structures capitalistes et impérialistes des U.S.A.

Il est évident que l'objectif nº1 sera essentiellement poursuivi par les seuls afro-américains. Quant à l'objectif nº2, il concernera tous les révolutionnaires.

- le problème de l'exploitation.

J'ai indiqué plus haut que l'objectif n°2 était une œuvre d'ensem-ble; simplement parce qu'il visait à résoudre un problème qui n'est pas particulier aux Noirs: le problème de l'exploitation de l'homme par l'iiomme. Il n'est pas nécessairement lié à la couleur de la peau.

Quant au problème du racisme, on peut dire qu'il est spécifique à l'homme noir. On peut même poser l'équation suivante: Noir = Prolétariat du monde. A cause de sa seule per

L'Occident Blanc ne pont pas nier s'être d sur la sueur anglaices. La
du Noir. Prenez les Antilles françaises, holland mome sauce. Pronoz
les Etats-Unis das sieckudents. Prenez les Etats-Unis d'aujourd'hui, Prenez l'Afrique. histoire est élo- quente à co sujet.

Les Dlanes de l'Occident trouvent leur jur d'occidental
dans la négation du Noir en tant que Noir. Ils o du Noir un être
sub-humain pour rationaliser l'exploitation du iwdir. Pour no pás s'huinilier en tant qu'hoinines.

- Oul, bien sûr, il y a le « Code Noir» de Colbert. Mais tout de même, celle exploitation du Noir ne peut pas être simplement tun fait de psychológie appliquée, car en fait, le racisme apparait bien comme une manifestation de la lulle des classes. Il n'y a qu'à re-prendre les exemples.

STOCKELY. - D'abord, il y a un problème Iminédint: colul de la prise de conscienco do la victime en faco. du bourreau. C'est en tant que Noirs que nous entendons, nous battre.

Il resto qu'aux Etats-Unis, un Noir «bien placé» sur le plan éco-nomiquo n'échappe pas au racisme.

Il n'est que de lire la presso américaine pour s'en convaincre. Le problème du racisme Ici n'est pas nécessairement lié au problème do l'exploitation.

Le racisme falt partie de l'arsenal idéologique et pratique de l'im-périalisme américain. Les Noirs sont d'autant plus exposés que les Blancs occidentaux ont détruit les cultures africaines de l'homme noir, les Noirs, dans le monde, parlent la langue de leurs maîtres. Or la culture comme dit Fanon, est une «force cohésivo»: II leur faut donc aussi résister à cette culture d'imposition (le plagin, le petit-negro ?).

Dans le cadre des Afro-américains cola transparaît sous la for-mo du christianisme. Le christianisme est une culture d'imposition, c'est-à-dire cosentielluinent une culture Impérialiste, parce quo lice l'idéo de la valeur universolle du maître. Vous devez en savoir quelque choso en Afrique, avec le cortège de conversions forcées. En fait, in libération culturolle est uno choso très importante. Elle dolt viser à répéter lo oystema d'éducation du maîtro (on tant quo
Sodo final da imposition culturalto), l'oduontion capitallato viso

De juci ordre.com ?

Elle est nécessairement politiksie.

L'une des limites object.des dirigeants qui nous ont per dés est la suivante il cont fat appel aux oppresseurs et non ex opprimés. Nous, nous faison appel aux opprimés. Nous leur di sons:

«Si vous voulez être librea, il faut vous battre ! Le président Mao Tsé-toung indique avec raison que le pouvoir est au bout du fusil ». C'est justo. Nous oppererons nos fusils libérateurs aux fusils racistes de l'impérialisme américain, dans ses propres vilies. Nous le forcerons à se battre comme nous l'entendrons. Comme font nos camarades vietnamiens. S'il veut utiliser du napalm ot des rockols sur ses propres villes, nous n'y voyons pas d'inconvénients, mais nous nous baltrons, c'est une clioce entenduo.

Vois-tu un rapport cabe votre luile et celles des camarades vietnamiens, et des autres peuples en lutte contre l'imperialisme, U.S. cn löle?

Bien évidemment, chaque fois que les bases de l'impérialismo cont minées à l'extérieur, notre lulle s'en trouve proportionnolle-ment avantageo.

Nous voudrions bien par exemple qu'il co trouve un seul pays africain qui co développo par ses propres efforts, et nen en allant mendler chez les Blancs occulentauX.

Nous en nurions fait, pour ta mobilisation de nos manres fonda-mentales un modèlo psychologique et méthodique à la fois. Mais on no poul pas dire qu'il y ait un seul paya révolutionnaire en Afri-quo à l'heuro actuelle. C'est d'ailleurs pour cela que l'O.U.A. est paralyséc. Aujourd'hul, si des Noirs américains avaient à s'exiler on Afrique, pas un soul pays alkionin ne les accepterait pour la bonne raison que tous ces pays cont soumis au joug de l'impérialisme américain.

Toutes les petites bourgeoisies contre-révolutionnaires au pou-voir en Afrique sont inféodées à Johnson, et exploitent leur pro-pres frères de couleur.

Quelle est votre tâche principale en ce moment. Celle qui re-qulert actuellement la priorité ?

D'abord, éliminer nos ennemis, c'est-à-dire tous les mouvements contre-révolutionnaires voulant s'intégrer à la société capitalisto blanche.

Ensuite, organiser notre pounle pour qu'il acquierre lo mordant of-fensil, condition sine qua non pour briser le statut quo d'aujourd'hui. Car c'est bien cola que signifie la lutte défensive des Luther King et autres.

Pour valncre, il s'agit d'allaquer. C'est un programme minimuni.

modabir ol à perpetrer la société capitaliste.

Pratiquement, comment tout cela peut-il s'agencer ?

En organisant les Noirs. Higloriquement, nous venons tous d'Afri-que. In nous dispersant dans leur monde, les Blancs occidentaux nous ont appris, par la négative certes, mais nous ont appris quand même à apprécier l'unité. Nous savons aujourd'hui, que l'unité, c'est la puissance. C'est pour réaliser cut impératif d'unité que nous avons arrêté, dans un premier temps, do nous réaliser culturellement, en rejetant le christianisme (culture d'imposition, liúb à l'idée do su-prématie do la culturo des Blancs occidentaux).

Le problème à résoudre est celui de créer des révolutionnaires noirs. Pour nous, cela signifio 3 objectils:

1.  Adoption d'une langue nationale africaino : lo swahill, par exemplo.
2.  Destruction du christianismo.
3.  Redécouvrir l'Afrique, mais d'une mantère scientifique, pour y puiser nos propres héros, au lieu d'assumer les héros blancs occidentaux.

En comme, recréer notre culture pour en faire une force do cohésion.

Dégager uno Idéologio polilique commune. A cot égard l'expérion-co do la Révolution chinoise est riche d'exemples mobilisateurs..

Notre tâche à nous est do luller pour acquérir une idéalogie cor-recle, capable d'unifier tous les Noirs.

La chose fondamentale à retenir, c'est de contribuer à développer la conscience qui doit amener l'Américain noir à résister. Cette concclence est nécessairo.

# Stockoly CARMICHAEL:

Notre objectif final:

Nous attaquer, aux
structures capitalistes
des U.S.A.

Dans son numéro du Promier Mai, l'«HumanitéNouvelle », organe central du Parti Communiste Marxiste-Léniniste de France a publié une interview de Stockely Carmichael, leader du «Black Power» (Pouvoir Noir). Cette interview'a été réalisée par un camarade africain lors du récent séjour de Carmichael à Paris.

Le Black Power est un mouvement de masse de Afro-américains. Certaines de ces positions peuvent ne pas toujours coïncider avec celles des marxistes-léninistes mais Il est évident que le combat du Black Power est héroïque, courageusement anti-raciste, anti-impérialiste.

C'est cela qui est important: C'est pour cette raison que nous reproduisons ce remarquable document.

La grande vague de combativité qui déferle sur les barricades *villes américaines*, *dressent*, *en un combat historique*, *les larges masses afro-américaines constamment contre les fonctionnaires et élus réactionnaires*, *les victimes racistes de l'ordre capitaliste Antillais*, *c'est déjà l'armateur de la citadelle impérialiste* elle même, *l'amorce de la lutte franco-arabe*. *Elle commence, par exemple*.

STOCKELY CARMICHEL - L'aspect principal de la situation du peuple afro-américain est celui d'une nouvelle forme de colonialismo intérieur. Il s'agit d'une situation presque originale qui implique que notre lutte se fixe deux objectifs principaux:

*   Objectif numéro 1 : éliminer l'oppression coloniale qui nous vise en tant que Noirs sur le triplo plan économique, social et politique.
*   Objectif numéro 2 : nous attaquer aux structures capitalistes et impérialistes des U.S.A.

-- le problème du racisme

-- le problème da l'exploitation.

J'ai indiqué plus haut que l'objectif n°2 était une couvre d'ensem-
bla; simplement parce qu'il visait à résoudre un problème qui
n'est pas particulier aux Noirs: to problème de l'exploitation de
l'honime par l'liomme. Il n'est pas nécessairement lié à la couleur
do la peau.

Quant au probléma du racismo, on peut dire qu'il est spécifiquo
à l'homme noir. On peut même poser l'équation ivante : Noir ==

Les Blanes de l'Occident trouvent leur ju du Noir un être
dans la négation du Noir en lant que Noir. Ila o
sub-humain pour rationaliser l'exploitation du indir. Pour no pás
shunilier en tant qu'hoinnes.

Oui, bien sûr, il y a le « Code Noir» de Colbert. Mais tout de
même, celle exploitation du Noir ne peut pas être cimplement un
fait de psychologio appliquée, car en falt, le racisme apparaît bien
comme une manifestation de la lutte des classes. Il n'y a qu'à re-
prendre les exemples.

STOCKELY. - D'abord, il y a un problema Iminédiat: celul do la
priso do conscienco do la victime en faco. du bourreau. C'est en
tant que Noirs quo nous entendons nous battre.

Il resto qu'aux Etats-Unis, un Noir «bien placé » sur le plan éco-
nomique n'échappe pas au racisme.

Il n'est que do lire la presse américaine pour s'en convaincre. Le
problème du racisme ici n'est pas nécessairement lié au problème
do l'exploitation.

Le racisme falt partie de l'arsenal idéologique et pratique de l'im-
périalisine arméricain. Les Noirs sont d'autant plus exposés que les
Blanes occidentaux ont détruit les cultures africaines de l'homme
noir, les Noirs, dans le monde, parient la langue de leurs maîtres.
Or. la culture comme dit Fanon, est une «force cohésivo»: I
leur faut donc aussi résister à cette culture d'imposition (le pidgin,
le petit-negro ?).

Dans le cadre des Afro-américains cela transparait sous la for-
mo du christlariismo. Le christianismo est une culture d'imposition,
c'est-à-dire cocentiellement une culture Impérialiste, parce quo lice
à l'idéo de la valeur universelle du maître. Vous devez en savoir
quelque chose en Afrique, avec le cortège de conversions forcées.

De quel ordre cot-clín 7

Ella est nécessairement politique.

L'une des limites objets des dirigeants qui nous ont pres
dés est la suivante: it out at appel aux oppressuurn et hon aux
opprimés. Nous, nous faisons appel aux opprimés. Nous leur di-
sons:

«Si vous voulez être libres, il faut vous battre ! Le président
Mao Tsé-toung indique avec raison que « le pouvoir est au bout du
fusil». C'est justo. Nous oppemerons nos fusils libérateurs aux fusils
racistes de l'impérialismo américain, dans ses propres villes.

Nous le forcerons à co be're comme nous l'entendrons. Comme
font nos camarades vicinamicas. S'il veut utiliser du napalm et des
rockels sur ces propres villes, nous n'y voyous pas d'inconvénients,
mais nous nous baltrons, c'est une cliose entenduo.

Vois-tu un rapport calle votre luile et celles des commarades
vietnamiens, et des autres peuples en katte contre l'impérialisme,
U.S. en tête ?

Bien évidemment, chaque fois que les bases de l'impérialismo
sont minées à l'extérieur, notre lutte s'en trouve proportionnelle-
nnment avantagéo.

Nous voudrions bien par exemple qu'il se trouve un coul pays
africain qui co dúveloppo par ses propres ciforts, of non en allant.
mendier chez les Blanes occidentaux.

Nous on aurions fait, pour la mobilisation de nos masres fonda-
mentales un modèle paychologique et méthodique à la fois. Mais
on ne peut pas dire qu'il y ait un seul pays révolutionnaire en Afri-
que à l'heure actuelle. C'est d'aillours pour cola que l'O.U.A. est
paralycéc. Aujourd'hui, si des Noirs américains avaient à s'exiler en
Afrique, pas un seul pays africain ne les accepterait pour la bonne
raison, que tous ces pays sont soumis au joug de l'impérialisme
américain.

Toutes les petites bourgeoisies contre-révolutionnaires au pou
voir en Afrique sont intéodées à Johnson, et exploitent leur pro-
pres frères de couleur.

Quelle est votre fûche principale en ce moment. Celle qui re-
qulert actuellement la priorité ?

D'abord, éliminer nos enncamis, c'est-à-dire lous les mouvements
contro-révolutionnaires voulant s'intégrer à la société capitalisto
blanche.

Ensuite, organiser notre peuple pour qu'il acquierre le mordant of-
fonsif, condition sine qua non pour briser lo statut quo d'aujourd'hui.
Car c'est bien cola que signilio la lutte défensive des Luther King
et autres.

Pour vaincre, il s'agit d'attaquer, C'est un programme minimum.

relablir et à perpetuer la société capitaliste.

- Pratiquement, comment tout cela peut-il s'agencer ?

En organisant les Noirs. Historiquement, nous venons tous d'Afri
que. En nous dispersant dans leur monde, les Blancs occidentaux
nous ont appris, par la négative certes, mais nous ont appris quand
même à apprécier l'unité. Nous savons aujourd'hui, que l'unité, c'est
la puissance. C'est pour réaliser cet impératif d'unité que nous a
vons arrêté, dans un premier temps, de nous réaliser culturellement,
en rejetant le christianisme (culture d'imposition, liés à l'idée de su
prématie de la culture des Blancs occidentaux).

- Le problème à résoudre est celui de créer des révolutionnaires
  noirs. Pour nous, cela signifie 3 objectifs:

1. Adoption d'une langue nationale africaine: le swahill, par
   exemple.
2. Destruction du christianisme.
3. Redécouvrir l'Afrique, mais d'une manière scientifique, pour y
   puiser nos propres héros, au lieu d'assumer les héros blancs
   occidentaux.

En somme, recréer notre culture pour en faire une force de cohé
sion.

Dégager uno idéologie politique commune. A cet égard l'expérien
ce de la Révolution chinoise est riche d'exemples mobilisateurs.
Notre tâche à nous est de lutter pour acquérir une idéologie cor
recte, capable d'unifier tous les Noirs.

La chose fondamentale à retenir, c'est de contribuer à développer
la conscience qui doit amener l'Américain noir à résister. Cette
conscience est nécessaire.

MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Jamaican Special Branch Report -
Jamaica/United States Black Power Ties

1. Pertinent items from the Jamaican Special Branch monthly report for April 1968, which contains several references to ties between Black Power groups in Jamaica and the United States, are provided, in full, below. A summary of the report, omitting portions concerning the United States or United States citizens, has been disseminated in CS-311/06459-68, a copy of which is attached.

2. The items of possible interest, omitted from the dissemination, are noted below:

a. During April 1968, four meetings of the Wilson faction of the Nation of Islam (NOI) were held. On 13 April, Darcy Hayles, the boxer, said that he was impressed with the doctrine and had written to Elijah Mohammed asking for a scholarship to enable him to study in one of the Islam Universities in the United States. Errol Levy said that only a revolution could end the white man's practice of robbing the black people of everything.

b. At the meeting on 24 April, Cecil (Prince Buster) Campbell stated that the premises on 47 Charles Street in Kingston belonged to him and he was willing for it to be used for the assistance of the black race. He called for unity among black people and said that his organization was fighting to rule Jamaica. He told members that they should be prepared to meet the Reverend Sherriffe (aka Thomas View) who would soon be visiting the Island.

c. On the 5th and 8th of April, discussions were held led by George Vassel, leader of the Young Socialist


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 146

-2-

League and a member of the Jamaican (Caribbean)
Torkers Novement, on the possibility of holding
demonstrations at the American Embassy in Kingston
to protest against the assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King. Vassel claimed that there was a United
States citizen hiding in Jamaica to escape the draft
who had in his possession recordings of speeches made
by the late lialcola X during 1964. One of these vas
entitled "The Ballot or Bullets". He stated that King's
death disproved his theory of non-violence and was
bringing into proalaence men like Stokely Carmichael
and H. Rap Brown.

d. During April, about 40 persons including
Winston Jonroe, Joseph Christie, Roy Jeffrey, Leonard
Solomon and one Ny Survad, who is the American draft
escapee referred to in Paragraph c. above, net at
23 Fourth Street, Trench Town (Dallas Corner), where
Survad, identified as a Black Muslin and a nember of
the Black Power Hovement (BPM), nered questions put
to him by the gathering. It was understood that Survad
was in Jamaica to solicit support for the BPM in the
United States as well as to establish a branch here.
The record "The Ballot or Bullets" was played by
Survad and recorded by Monroe.

e. Survad accepted George Myers' invitation to
attend a get-together which he was arranging in Savanna-
la-Mar on 11 27, and to spend a week or two with him
there. They discussed the Congress of Racial Equality
(CORE) and the SPM, and it was suggested that a local
Steering Committee should be appointed to consider the
formation of a group in Jamaica.

f. (Jamaica Service Comment: Survad ins subse-
quently been identified as John Davis, aka Selvyn Grey,.
a member of CORE and the Black Muslins, He is in touch
with Rastafarious at Kintyre, and the leaders of the
Viking and Spade Gangs. He is expecting to meet one
Corporal Jases, ka "Jimmy" of the Jamaica Defence
Force, who is said to have complained that he was
deprived of promotion because of his views. Arrange-
nents were also being made for him to meet Walter Rodney
of the University of the West Indies. Survad has stated


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

13-00000

that if given the chance he would, within eighteen
months, stage a demonstration. He has suggested that
if his colleagues can supply marijuana and find a way
to export it, he could guarantee an outlet in the
United States and the money thus obtained could be
used to finance the local Movement. Survad was being
supported by his girlfriend, Bernadine Houston, who
was expected to arrive from the United States towards
the end of the ensuing month. He is now in straitened
circumstances.)

Dear Mrs. King:

While on this East European Church-min's Study Tour, I visited a little town in East Germany, called Herrnhut. The Moravian Church (oldest in Herrnhut) officials, hosted our group during our visit there. I saw your husband's books on sale in their one good bookstore.

A young man who is head of the youth work in Herrnhut, informed us that they are setting up a room in the Youth Center, in memory of Dr. King! He wanted your address so that he could write and let you know what they were doing and the respect they have for Dr. King's memory. I gave him your address, so I am writing to let you know that, if you haven't heard from him

yet, you will be receiving communications from Dietrich Weise, 89 Gorlitz D.D.R., Bautzener Str. 38, and you will be aware of what is happening in this small Eastern Germany town, a population of only 2,000.

Respectfully,

O'Connell provided the Consulate General, Hong Kong, with information on some of the other members of the group. He had the following to say about Louis Alhonote:

"Louis ALHONOTE, from Brooklyn, was mentally ill and had been told by a doctor that he was paranoic. Once in a meeting of the American group when one of the other members disagreed with him, he dashed a glass cup against the wall. On a second such occasion, he threw a glass cup at Jake ROSEN, which caused Rosen to have three stitches in his chin and five in his biceps.. This second incident was hushed up only with difficulty because the Chinese authorities learned of it when a doctor was called."

"You can see the future through the Chinese people. You can obtain a firm conviction that China will continuously advance forward. As a western visitor, nothing impressed me more than the great power of this country. Every person in New China is very modest but has great pride; they are united, have self-respect, and respect each other. No one can overlook China's advance; it is to be regretted that many people do not have the opportunity to observe it personally. I like Shanghai very much, because from the way Shanghai has changed I can really understand New China. In the old Shanghai, except for the Chinese, everyone had special privileges. However, everything has changed greatly. I am of the opinion that from this, one can see the miracles which have begun in this great country."

"Larry MOYER, age 32, was reporting on the trip for United Press. O'Connell was Moyer's roommate in Moscow, and had learned of many of Moyer's past experiences before O'Connell had indicated where he stood politically. Moyer had been a pimp in Hawaii in 1941, working through the photograph shops where a serviceman could get his picture taken with a hula girl. He had also been afriend of Ada B. Jackson, whom O'Connell described as "a well-known pink in New York"; Moyer had known her through American Labor Party meetings there. O'Connell said that Moyer was crude, but by no means stupid."

SUBJECT: Ebassy De-briefing of Shelby Tucker, American Student Who Visited Communist China

Mr. Shelby Tucker, an Amorican student at Oxford University,
visited Comunist China in company with soveral other students
at the conclusion of the Moscow Youth Fostival. After his arrival
in Poking he was requested by the Chinono Cartunist authorities to
surronder his passport. ir. Tucker refused to do this and as a
result was deported from China into the Soviet Union. lle roturned
to London on September 12 and during his discussions with the
Babassy voluntoored to proparo a statement of his impressions of
Communist China based on his notos. This statement is transmitted
as onclosure one.

Shortly after Mr. Tucker arrived in London ho was approached
by Lifo magazino for his story, which it is understood he sold to
the editors for a sum of $500.00. A copy of this story, which
was written by a Life staff writer based on Mr. Tuckor's romarks
is transmitted as enclosure two. The Embassy understands that
Life magazine is not now planning to publish this story.

Thore is transmitted as onclosure three a copy of Mr. Tucker's
affidavit regarding the use of his passport in Communist China.
This affidavit has already boon transmitted to the Department under
separate cover in connection with Mr. Tucker's passport difficulties
but is included here for the Department's convenionco.

It was the impression of the de-briefing officers that Mr.
Tucker was sincere in his desire to furnish-information which
might be of use to the United States Government. Unfortunately,
however, Hr. Tucker seems to have vory little background in
Chinese affairs and his observations, both written and oral, appear
to contain little significant political or economic information.

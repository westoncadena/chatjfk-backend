Office: (202) 225-4261
Home: (703) 941-6899

Age: 32
Birthplace: Washington, D.C.
Marital Status: Legally separated (no children)

Skills: Shorthand 120 wpm Typing 65 wpm

EDUCATION: High school graduate; graduate of the Washington School for Secretaries.

EXPERIENCE: May 27, 1962 - Present - Office of Congressman Thomas N. Downing, First District of Virginia.

My entire working experience has been in Congressman Downing's office and has fallen into two major categories:

April 1969 - Present - Caseworker - Duties include dealing with all constituents' problems relating to military service, retired military and veterans; requires a thorough knowledge of all military personnel procedures. Primary emphasis is personal counseling for constituents who have problems which they feel they are unable to resolve through normal channels. This position demands a strong, unemotional and patient disposition and the ability to impose reality upon constituents who are undergoing problems ranging from fairly routine ones to severe mental and emotional conditions. This counseling is primarily telephonic but often personal interviews are required. Also, handle U.S. Military Academy appointments; requires selecting all Congressman's nominees to the four major service academies. Compose all correspondence required to execute the functions of this position.

May 27, 1962 - April 1969 - Composed correspondence dealing with numerous facets of constituent inquiries concerning legislation, federal agencies, government publications, casework and academies. General office duties including dictation, typing and filing. Acquired a thorough working knowledge of all aspects of a Congressional office.

ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

As you probably know, I am retiring at the end of the 94th Congress after spending eighteen years in the House. For the entire period of my service I have been blessed by having a wonderful staff to assist me. I am making whatever effort I can to assist them in obtaining employment on the Hill.

One of the finest people on my staff is Nancy S. Jenkins. She has been with me continuously for the past fourteen years. She now handles all military and veterans casework and makes my nominations to the U.S. Military Academies, but she has such a varied experience that she can handle almost any matter that comes up in a Congressional office. I have no hesitancy whatsoever in enthusiastically endorsing her for your consideration if you should have a vacancy in your office. She is an outstanding young lady whose intelligence, dedication and loyalty are unquestioned. Nancy is extremely congenial, affable and has the ability to promote and foster constituent appeal for her Congressman.

If you or your assistant should decide to interview her, please call my office, x54261; and if you desire any further information about her, please do not hesitate to contact me. My home number in Newport News, Virginia is 804 596-2188.

Sincerely,

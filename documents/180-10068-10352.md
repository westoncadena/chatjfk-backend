Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 13

Dear Mr. Sprague:

When we talked the other week, you asked that I write to you to state formally my interest in working on the staff of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and to tell you when I would be ready to go to work.

As I told you during the interview, I am extremely interested in working as a member of the committee's staff. I look forward with enthusiasm to such an opportunity.

I spoke with Judge Higginbotham last week, and it appears that my duties in connection with my appointment as a special master will be essentially over within the next two weeks. I have also inquired about living arrangements in Washington, D.C. While nothing is definite yet, I am confident that I can find a room in one of the Jesuit communities there--most probably at Georgetown University--within the next two weeks as well. As a result, I can assure you that I will be ready to go to work in Washington, D.C., on Monday, December 13, 1976.

One last item--in accordance with your suggestion, I have been doing some background reading on the scope of the investigatory powers of Congressional committees.

Thanks again for taking time out of your busy schedule to see me. With every best wish, I am

Sincerely yours,
Tom Gounon.
Thomas M. Gannon, S.J.

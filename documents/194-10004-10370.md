## 4. REPORT OF FINDINGS

(BIRTH-FATHER) On 23 September 1968, a check of the birth records of Manuel Marti, father of Manuel MARTI, was conducted at the Bureau of Demographic Registry, Department of Health, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Santurce, Puerto Rico. Mrs. Candita Hernandez de Buxo, Records Supervisor, furnished a Certificate of Birth Registration, dated 20 March 1963, issued by Tomas Beauchamp, Registrar, Utuado, Puerto Rico, which revealed the following pertinent information:

Name: Adrian Martir (sic)

Date of Birth: 11 August 1910

Place of Birth: Utuado, Puerto Rico

Father's Name: Not Recorded

Father's Place of Birth: Not Recorded

Mother's Name: Juana Martir-Aponte (sic)

Mother's Place of Birth: Utuado, Puerto Rico

Registered By: Not Recorded

Date Registered: 22 September 1910

Certificate Number: Certificate 636, Page 257, Book 44, (EXHIBIT III)

AGENT'S NOTES: Attention is invited to Court Order in the Spanish language, dated 12 February 1963, by which SUBJECT'S father legally changed his name to Manuel Marti, (EXHIBIT IV), which was subsequently translated into the English language (EXHIBIT V). Attention is further invited to the discrepancy between the spelling of SUBJECT'S father's surname on the Court Order and on the Certificate of Birth Registration. Source advised that the spelling Martir was a typographical error, and that the surname would be changed to read Marti. Attention is further invited to the fact that the term natural child is a term used in Puerto Rico, when a child's birth is registered at the Bureau of Demographic Registry by someone other than the parents of the child. The child takes the name of the mother and the father's name does not appear on the record, inasmuch as the parents are not married to each other.

# IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ELIGIBLES

YOU HAVE RECEIVED AN ELIGIBLE NOTICE OF RATING. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

IT MEANS THAT: Your name has been placed on the list of persons who have passed this examination, in its proper relative standing. This list of eligibles, or register, is kept by the office whose name and address appears in the lower tight-hand cornet on the other side of this notice.

IT MEANS THAT: When your name is reached on the register, you will be considered for the type of jobs for which you have qualitied, (in the geographical area) covered by the examination. (When a Federal agency requests the Commission to supply the names of eligibles, the names of the three eligibles at the top of the register are certified to the agency for consideration.). The agency appointing officer may choose any one of these three persons, so long as he complies with the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944; as amended.

IT MEANS THAT: Your prospects for getting a job from this examination cannot be predicted. They depend upon how many vacancies may wour to be filled by eligibles, and on your relative standing on the register. Your name will be certified for contuderation as it comes within reach and as requetts for eligibles are received. (If you are not selected, your name will go back on the register in its proper relative standing, to he considered again when within reach until the register is terminated.)

IT MEANS THAT YOU MUST INFORM THE OFFICE WHICH ISSCED THIS NOTICE OF RATING OF ANY CHANGES IN YOUR ADDRESS OR IN THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH YOU WILL ACCEPT ΑΡΡΟΙΝΤΜENT. SEND ANY NEW INFORMATION CONCERNING YOUR ADDRESS OR AVAILABILITY TO THE OFFICE WHOSE-NAME AND ADDRESS IS SHOWN IN THE LOWER RIGHT-HAND CORNER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS NOTICE, AND BLUER TO THE TITLE OF THE EXAMINATION AND THE RATING RECEIVED.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

1.  Any offer of appointment or inquiry as to availability which you may receive from a Federal agency will show whether you are being considered for a limited temporary, a career-conditional, of a career appointment.

2.  If, when you are considered for appointment, you signify that you are not available or you fail to reply to a communica. tion, your name will be removed from the register until you satisfactorily explain your reasons and specify the conditions under which you would be willing to accept any appointment. When you are unable to accept any appointment you should request that your name be suspended from the register_uncil. quests for restoration white it is is st still in use, changes in availability, or transfer of eligibility, will be acted on without further notice to you.

3.  If you are now employed by the Federal Government and have received an eligible rating, show this notice to your per! sonnel officer. He should be aware of your eligibility on this examination. THIS DOES NOT RELEASE YOU FROM YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP THE OFFICE MAINTAINING

YOUR ELIGIBILITY INFORMED OF CHANGES AS MEN. TIONED ABOVE.

4.  A competitor who received an eligible rating may, under certain conditions, have his eligibility transferred from the regis. ter of one civil service othee to a similar register in another civil service office.

A competitor who wishes to have his eligibility transferred should send his request to the office where his eligibility is maintained.

ermination will then be made, and the competitor will be notified, as to whether his eligibility can be transferred.

5.  A register established from an examination held in order to fill a specific type of position at a stated salary may also be used to fill vacancies in telated positions or at a lower salary. When you accept a career-conditional or a career appointment, your name will be removed from all registers established as a result of this examination. Until your name is removed, your willingness to accept a tower salary will not affect your eligi. bility for positions at a higher salary.

U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1985 0-754-130

If you are not appointed or the register is not officially terminated earlier, your eligibility from this examination will be in effect for a period of 18 months only unless you submit up-to-date information about your qualifications before that time by letter, Standard Form 57 or Form 57A; however, such information will not be accepted if you have had eligibility for less than 1 year. The date of issue which appears on this "Notice of Rating" is that on which your period of eligibility began.

Mr. Maksymlee's primary experience has been in practical photography. Since joining the Exploratory Ievelopment Laboratory Branch, he has learned the theoretical side of photography and combined tals with his already extensive knowledge of the photographie process. He has carried out several investigations ich indicate a natural bent for selentific methods. After initial briefings, he requiren little, if any, supervision. His maturity is a distinct asset in his work. where extreme attention to detall and good Judgement-are-absolute necessities. He ezhibitis a willingness to work for the group, no matter the houril, and cooperates and works well with others.

His responsibilities and quality of effort are deserving of more than his current 60-7 status. It is therefore recommended that Mr. Makayaiec be promoted to 65-8.

Dear Mr. Maksymiec:

This letter is in response to the comment you made to the Director on Alumni Day, 26 April 1975, concerning a special medallion for NPIC employees who participated in the Cuban missile crisis.

I have had the appropriate records reviewed. The Certificate of Commendation you and other NPIC employees received was awarded by direction of the President in recognition of the meritorious service performed.

It is hoped that the lack of a medallion to accompany this certificate will in no way detract from the contribution you made during this period of crisis.

Sincerely,

/s/John E. Blake

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

Fred:

1. The facts behind the question raised with the Director by Mr. Maksymec on Saturday, 26 April, are, according to him, as follows.

2. After NPIC had done its fine work during the Cuban missile crisis it appears that two different types of recognition were given. Determinations were made first on certain individuals whose contributions were such that they should receive an Agency medal award. A second group of some 200 were then identified for their level of contribution and received some kind of certificate from the White House signed by the President. Mr. Maksymec was in the latter group and espouses the cause that a "special medallion" should have been given along with the White House certificate. Mr. Rob Gaynor also spoke to me on this matter on Saturday, and has a good recollection on the whole matter.

3. Will you do what you can on the matter and prepare me a letter to be sent to Mr. Maksymec?

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Mr. Myroslaw Maksymiec - Retired Employee

The meeting with Mr. Maksymiec on 6 May 1975 was to satisfy his request to review his official personnel rile (this matter was being treated in the manner of a request under the Freedom o Information Act). Location: Main Reception Interview Roca at Headquarters Building 3p.m.

The duration of the meeting was one (1) hour of which tine N. Maksymiec used approximately 7 to 3 minutes to quickly thumb thru the OPF. It is my impression that he was surprised: 1) we were allowing him to see all the material in the file ( he described vividly, a 1971 unpleasant encounter with Mr. Echols, the Director of Fersonnel, who refused to show him a document and would only read to him a small portion from it - this caused his request and subsequent interview with the DCI, Mr. Helma), and 2) at the reality that the file contained nothing actually derogatory (he stated he had seen and signed the fitness reports so these represented nothing unknown).

The major portion of the time was consumed in my listening to his. evaluation and assessment of the various supervisors and co-vorkers at NPIC and their shortcomings. He regaled me with mush of his background and history with the military and initial application and entrance on duty with the Agency; his personal acquaintance and relationships with notables - a former American Ambassador to Ethiopia, Joseph Simonson, the Emperor of Ethiopia, several Generals and Congressional personalities, Mr. Helms and Mr. Arthur Lundahl, and his membership in the Explorer Club.

Presently he is Vice President for Sales of the Environmental Coating Industries Corporation located in Annandale, Virginia - the company removes corrosion and stains from surfaces. He offered the company services at the 1974 Alumni session, to clean the stains from the Nathan Hale statue at the front of the.. building, at a cost of $300. He plans to follow-up on his proposal, since he has not heard anything from the Agency.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

He mentioned that Mr. Blake, at the direction of the DCI, (1975 Alumni Day) was to explore and advise him (Maksymiec) of the possibility of striking and issuing a medal to about 200 Agency personnel (of whom he is one) for their participation in certain aspects of the 1962 Cuban crisis.

Our meeting ended with Mr. Maksymiec indicating he had no intention of "going after anybody," but he was curious what was in his file, and that was the basis for asking to see it.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. State suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment on foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties and cost consciousness in the use of personnel, space, equipment and funds, must be commented on if applicable. If extra space is needed to complete Section C, attach a separate sheet of paper.

During the past reporting period, Mr. Maksymiec's responsibilities were more pointedly directed towards the requirements of a laboratory technician as described in the position description and less towards his previous utilization as a photographer. A conference was held with him on 15 June to explain the need for this redirection and a memo ATB 147/70 dated 16 June was prepared and furnished to him detailing of performing these duties and was anxious to stop being thought of as a photographer and welcomed the opportunity to move into a more technically oriented activity. The specific duties outlined are listed in Section B of this report.

It was expected that there would be a learning period during which his proficiency would gradually increase in these new responsibilities. However, progress has not been as rapid as had been hoped due to what appears to be a lack of initiative on his part coupled with severe emotional outbursts against his immediate supervisor and other Center personnel. The latest of these occurred on 22 August in which he used abusive language in the presence of other Branch personnel including the Branch Chief against his Section Chief. This necessitated a written letter of reprimand and his transference to direct supervision by the Branch Chief, and as of 5 October 1970, to another Section within the Branch.

The ratings of M in Duties 1 and 2 of Section B reflect primarily the subject's reluctant participation in data collection and his lack of initiative in learning the operation of the microdensitometer. In duties 4, 5, 6, he has required a maximum amount of supervision which has resulted in senior personnel doing the work.

FITNESS REPORT

It may be argued that this has not provided him with sufficient first-level supervision to allow him to learn the skills required to perform those duties.
To insure that he is given every opportunity to perform in his new section, written assignments and accomplishments will be submitted on a daily basis.
In line with previous reports, it is still felt that Mr. Maksymiec is essentially mis-assigned as he is an expert photographer and should be assigned in some area where his skill can be utilized to its fullest extent.

Mr. Maksymiec in basically an excellent photographer who naturally lends a hand as a D&E Technician. Unfortunately, he must be rated according to his job classification as a D&E Technician, and he suffers accordingly.

In his previous fitness report, he was alerted to the need to direct his interest toward becoming a technician and away from his photographic activities. He has not completely heeded this advice.

Two distinct training activities were advised for assisting him in making the transition: a course of instruction in math necessary to discharging technician's duties, and on the job project work. The former persisted for only a short time, due presumably to his lack of ability and/or interests. He improved very little from this instruction. His assistance on a project for developing an ammonia leak detector was effective, and the project was a success; however, his thin knowledge of the scientific method diminished his appreciation of the concept of experimentally controlled variables.

In short, he had to be watched closely to insure that his well-meaning "Improvement" did not disrupt the experimental plan. His interest and cooperation in this program were commendable, and his overall project performance was adequate.

Mr. Maksymiec is basically mis-assigned. His abilities and interests lie in the photographic field where he does a very commendable job. However, the Laboratory needs the services of properly trained technicians to assist the physical scientists in their research efforts. Since Mr. Maksymiec's expertise is not in this area, it is again recommended that suitable employment as a photographer be found for him.

Mr. Maksymiec's ability as a staff photographer in un-diminished. His photographic ability is considered by all in the Center as excellent.

It has been pointed out to Mr. Maksymice that the laboratory does not have a basic requirement, or a slot for a photographer, and since he is carried as a D & E technician, he should be more qualified than he is in other aspects of photographic and scientific research other than straight "picture taking", as he does not have the basic foundation either in formal education or experience to perform successfully as a D & E technician. This lack of qualification in this area can be partly explained by two factors: (1.) Mr. Maksymiec's position. description was recently changed due to the reorientation of the laboratory'a primary mission and hunction; and (2.) Because of his previous photographic responcibilities he did not have the opportunity to gain the new skills required to fulfill his new duties as a D & E technielan. Mr. Maksymiec will have to be re-trained from a photographer into a D & E technician so that he can con-
tribute more to help solve the laboratory assigned tasks.

Mr. Maksymice still had problems in his relationship with other members of the laboratory during this reporting period. It appears to have been about his concern with his position in the laboratory grade stricture and his felling that he was "ignored" by senior members of the laboratory. Mr. Maksymiec seems to have had a feeling that members of the laboratory Including his Chief did not re recognize his ability as a photographer and pay suitable deference to his

I concur in the ratings and comments of the rating officer. In the latter part of the rating period the activities of the Exploratory Laboratory were being changed from ad hoc researen projects to a directed program of planned investi- gations against NPIC and community problems. This change in activities reduced the freedom of choice in tasks to be accomplished and increased the demand for versatility in laboratory personnel. The lack of freedom and the assignment of unfamiliar tasks are distasteful to Mr. Maksymiec since he doubts that these activities will provide the personal recognition he has enjoyed for many years as an outstanding photographer.

Maksymiec, Myroslaw

Section C Continued

Fitness Report

He has also had serious disagreements with a summer intern and another member of the laboratory which had to be settled by conferences with the laboratory chief. A major dizagreement with the Laboratory Chief took place recently which resulted from his feeling that he had been treated unfairly without consideration for his age, knowledge and training.

As a result of these problems, a series of conferences with Mr. Maksymiec and cenior members of the division were held in order to find a possible solution for his problem. Because of these meetingn, an in-house training program has been initiated for Mr. Maksymiec. It is hoped that this will do much to alleviate his feelings of repret- sion and make him a contributing member of the laboratory once again.

Section D_Continued

In spite of the reduction in need for Mr. Maksymlec's primary skills, he has expressed a desire to continue his present assignment. Therefore, a program of retraining has been instituted to broaden his knowledge and increase his versatility in carrying out laboratory investigations. Mr. Maksymiec is a hard working, dedicated employee and there is every reason to expect that he will try hard to overcome his deficiencies. However, his age, limited education, previous success in photography, and lack of knowledge in scientific methoda pose serious obstacles to be overcome. His precent attitude is characterized by his own statement, "Show me how, and I will do it."

Mr. Maksymiec continues to excel in his primary duty as staff photographer. He processes his own photography and the finished product is consistently outstanding.

He cooperates most willingly with other members of the staff in assisting them with the practical photographic aspects of their projects.

There have been a few minor personality conflicts on procedural matters related to job assignments between Mr. Maksymiec and both staff and non-staff personnel, which have been reported to laboratory chief and the executive officer, TES. It is believed that this is due to his strong desire to excel at his job. This problem has been discussed with Mr. Maksymiec and it is expected that he will avoid such occurrences in the future.

During this reporting period Mr. Maksymiec has satisfactorily completed a night school course in technical reading and writing at Montgomery Junior College and is currently pursuing a course in photography at American University. He is to be highly commended for this continuing effort to train himself for a more responsible position.

Mr. Maksymiec is a valuable member of the EDLB and serves as its senior lab technician. He works closely with other members of the staff and contributes to the success of the laboratory.

His duties require him to maintain and develop many skills in the field of photographics. He carries out these duties and other responsibilities in a professional manner and with a minimum of supervision.

As senior laboratory technician he provides guidance for his junior technician. His ability to train this man in the field of photographic technology is considered superior.

Mr. Maksymiec recently completed a review course in "Basic Grammar." This course pointed out his main difficulties in written expression, and his teacher suggested methods for overcoming these difficulties. As a result of this course and after a consultation with Mr. R. B. Cheatham of the Educational and Psychological Service Bureau, Georgetown University, Mr. Maksymiec plans on taking a special English course at Montgomery Junior College this fall. This course concentrates on the fundamental of reading and writing. When he successfully completes this English course, he expects to continue his education with the ultimate goal of receiving his Bachelor's degree. Mr. Maksymiec is ambitious and hopes to train himself for a more responsible position. He is to be commended for this effort, and he will be given all possible aid within, the laboratory to help him fulfill his educational program.

Mr. Maksymiec continues to support the Exploratory Development Laboratory Branch as well as the senior laboratory technician. His duties require him to work closely with the physical scientists and by himself on various projects which require many practical and some theoretical skills.

Mr. Maksymiec works very well with others, follows instructions willingly, and carries out his responsibilities in a professional manner. He requires very little supervision and completes his assignments quickly and competently.

Mr. Maksymiec has made a conscientious effort to overcome his writing deficiency and has greatly improved this necessary skill since his last review. Although there is still room for improvement, it is felt that real progress has been made and improvement will continue in the future with sufficient practice.

Mr. Maksymiec's duties require him to provide guidance to the laboratory's junior technician. His ability to train this man and to help him increase his photographic skills is considered above average. It is felt that he is presently doing the work of a higher grade, so it is recommended that Mr. Maksymiec be promoted to GS-09.

## Section V COMMENTS

This review course in grammar and punctuation was too advanced for Mr. Maksymiec. He needs an elementary course on the English fundamentals preferably on a tutorial basis before he can adequately apply the rules of punctuation and grammar to his work.

In a personal conference with Mr. Maksymiec, the instructor analyzed his weaknesses in grammar and punctuation and suggested ways in which he might improve his performance in those areas.

# GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY
WASHINGTON. D. C. 20007

August 24, 1966

Name: Mr. Myroslaw A. Maksymiec

Mr. Myroslaw A. Maksymiec, age 49, came to this Bureau on August 1, 1966, in connection with the Veterans Administration's educational and vocational counseling program for former servicemen. Mr. Maksymiec is married, has two children, ages five and eight, and is employed by a federal governmental agency as a photographic research technician (GS 09/3). He retired from the United States Army in 1961 in the grade of Master Sergeant after serving for over 20 years with primary duties as an intelligence photographer. His education includes eight years of formal schooling, a high school completion equivalence certificate, and additional courses with the Graduate School, Department of Agriculture, and the United States Armed Forces Institute. Mr. Maksymiec stated that he was interested in further education at the college level in order to improve himself both personally and professionally in a field related to his present vocational activities.

In addition to several conferences with the undersigned, Mr. Maksymiec was administered a battery of educational and vocational tests. This report contains the results of these conferences and tests, the results of which should not be interpreted either as conclusive or final. They should be considered primarily as indications of various psychological factors that should be seriously considered by Mr. Maksymiec in making decisions concerning his educational and vocational goals.

In order to determine Mr. Maksymiec's fields of vocational interest he was given the Kuder Vocational Preference Record. When compared to a representative group of men in the national population, Mr. Maksymiec indicated that his interests are significantly similar to persons who are engaged in computational, scientific, and literary activities. Men who have interests similar to Mr. Maksymiec's are found in various engineering fields, astronomy, seismology, economics, psychology, and technical publications writing. These fields are closely allied to his present occupational endeavors.

On the Educational Interest Inventory, a device that is beneficial to an individual in discovering his interests in various fields of study, Mr. Maksymiec's responses indicated that his study interests are *very high* in physics; *high* in engineering, chemistry, earth science, and history and political science; *high average* in communication, zoology, and mathematics; and *average* in psychology. The areas in which he showed *low to average* interest were music, education, industrial arts, agriculture, botany, sociology, literature, art, business administration, and economics.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 75

Name: Myroslaw A. Maksymiec

Mr. Maksymiec also took the Army General Classification Test, Civilian Edition, to find out his overall level of mental ability. His score revealed that he exceeds approximately 78 percent of adults in general mental capacity as measured by this instrument. A safer evaluation of his performance is that he is probably in the upper 25 percent of adults regarding his global intelligence.

On the Michigan Vocabulary Profile Test, an instrument that attempts to measure a person's intellectual interests as well as the amount of information he has retained in various areas of knowledge, Mr. Maksymiec indicated, when compared with college freshmen, that he exceeds approximately 50 percent in his knowledge of human relations, 69 percent in government, and 67 percent in the physical sciences. On the lower side, he does as well or better than 24 percent in his familiarity with commerce, 31 percent in mathematics, and 24 percent in fine arts.

In order to find out Mr. Maksymiec's ability to handle English, a basic necessity for one to perform well in college, he was given the Cooperative English Tests. When compared to college freshmen, he showed that he exceeds from 52 percent to 78 percent in his understanding of vocabulary; from 5 to 17 percent in his ability to comprehend what he reads; from 2 to 11 percent in his speed of comprehension; and from 18 to 36 percent in his overall ability to know and understand what he reads under timed conditions. In his skill to express himself properly in English, he exceeds from 1 to 6 percent of college freshmen. When reading and expression are combined into one score, it may be said that Mr. Maksymiec exceeds from 6 to 12 percent of college freshmen in his overall usage of English.

The results of the above tests indicate that Mr. Maksymiec has made the most of his learning opportunities both within and outside the military service. Although he completed only eight years of school, he has acquired a considerable amount of knowledge by observation, reading, and personal experience. In spite of his broad experiences and acquired knowledge, it will be necessary for him to improve his reading and writing skills in English, however, before he begins college courses. Although he manifests a high interest in engineering and scientific fields, he should probably not consider these fields as majors because of his deficiency in mathematics. It is believed the skills in English can be developed but it is doubtful if the mathematical deficiencies can be overcome sufficiently to major in a scientific area. It is probably advisable, therefore, for Mr. Maksymiec to consider one of the social sciences as a college major. His background in photography and military subjects, combined with a college major in an appropriate social science, would probably provide him with the necessary qualifications to become a geographer or an intelligence analyst in government service.

It is understood that Mr. Maksymiec has enrolled in Montogomery Junior College, Takoma Park, Maryland, for the 1966 fall semester and that he will take a special English course concentrating on the fundamentals of reading

and written expression. After he completes this instruction, he might con-
sider working for an associate of arts degree in a social science at this
junior college with the ultimate goal of transferring later to a four-year
college to work toward a bachelor degree.

I have appreciated knowing and talking with Mr. Maksymiee and I trust
he will contact this Bureau if he requires further counseling assistance.
My best wishes go with this report in whatever plans Mr. Maksymiec makes
concerning his future plans and goals.

## NARRATIVE COMMENTS

Indicate significant strengths or weaknesses demonstrated in current position keeping in proper perspective their relationship to overall performance. Stato suggestions made for improvement of work performance. Give recommendations for training. Comment un foreign language competence, if required for current position. Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Maksymice, serving as the senior laboratory technician, sets a fine example for those whose responsibilities are similar and for the younger professionals for whom he provides photographic laboratory services. As a photographer he possesses rare compositional skills; his photographs of equipment for report and briefing purposes are exceptionally well-crafted, the finishing of surpassing quality. Hic work is careful, thorough, painstakingly accurate, and professional by all standards.

After more than a year in his present position, he feels more relaxed and self-assured. He asserts his views and ideas more competently and has become an integral and important part of this laboratory's operations. Mr. Maksymiec works exceptionally well with others, accepts responsibility freely and requires a minimum of direction. Most of his assignments come as discretionary orders, with complete freedom to utilize his own talents and inclinations towards the solution of his assigned problems. He continues to improve his capabilities, and is presently enrolled in a Department of Agriculture course in the fundamentals of photographic color processing, at his own request.

Mr. Maksymiec's one major weakness lies in the difficulty with which he writes reports. The ability to communicate ideas and results of investigations clearly, through written reports, is a necessary attribute of laboratory branch members, and Mr. Maksymiec must concentrate extra effort to improve his performance in this regard. During the next reporting period, he will be given assistance to improve his capabilities.

Mr. Maksymice's background and experience lie in practical photography, about which there is extremely little he does not know. Hafensterred from PSD/PLB primarily because there was little opportunity to use experience, and because the advancement potential appeared to be minimal..

From the day of his transfer, Mr. Maksymiec has performed capably. Much of the work has been new to him, requiring him to learn and master many aspects of theoretical photography. He has acquired proficiency in the use of laboratory measuring instruments. He has applied himself and learns rapidly, with good retention. His frame of mind has improved, and this is manifested in a more relazed, yet completely involved approach to his work. He works well with other and cooperates fully in all group problems. He accepts responsibility and requires direction of effort only in those theoretical areas where he has no experience. When responsible for the expenditure of funds, he exhibits a commendable cost-consciousness.

He recently took exeminations for the purposes of completing his High School education, and has attended mathematics classes at Fort Myer. This is an additional indication of the interest and feeling for his job, which is manifested by a consistently proficient level of output. de is a valued member of the Exploratory Development Laboratory Staff.

EDUCATION

High School equivalent certificate; completed a course in color photography in January 1966 (6 credit hours) taken at the Department of Agriculture Graduate School.

EXPERIENCE

Mr. Maksymice retired as a Master Sergeant in July 1961 after 20 years of Army photographic experience. He has been with the Center from November 1961 and with the Exploratory Development Laboratory Branch of the Plans and Development Staff since 15 September 1963. He is the senior technician for the laboratory.

JUSTIFICATION

Mr. Maksymlee's laboratory skills are of the highest professional quality. His duties as the senior laboratory technician require him to work closely with the physical scientists and by himself on various projects which require many practical and some theoretical skills. He conducts experimental laboratory investigations related to the photographic process, develops special techniques, and constructs supporting equipment. He carries out his assignments with little or no supervision and works well with others in the laboratory. He is an important and valued member of the Exploratory Development Laboratory Branch. It is felt that Mr. Maksymice is doing the work of a higher grade; therefore, it is recommended that Mr. Maksymiec be promoted to grade GS-09.

Dear Mr. Lundahl:

While I would like to make public the truly outstanding accomplishments of the National Photographic Interpretation Center, I realize that the anonymity of an organization of your high professional competence in the intelligence field must be maintained.

I do want you and your people to know of my very deep appreciation for the tremendous task you are performing under most trying circumstances. The analysis and interpretation of the Cuban photography and the reporting of your findings promptly and succinctly to me and to my principal policy advisers, most particularly the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, has been exemplary.

You have my thanks and the thanks of your government for a very remarkable performance of duty and my personal commendation goes to all of you.

Sincerely,

SUBJECT: Commendation

1.  As Director of Central Intelligence and on behalf of the entire intelligence community as well as the United States Government, I wish to commend you and the personnel under your command for the outstanding work you have been performing, especially during the past four months of the Cuban buildup.

2.  Your analysis and interpretation of the Cuban photography and the manner in which you reported your findings to the President, his principal policy advisors, most particularly the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense, and the entire intelligence community have been of the highest order.

3.  I have full knowledge of the tremendous pressures and long working hours with which NPIC was confronted. I regret that the anonymity required of a professional intelligence agency such as yours prevents public acknowledgment of NPIC accomplishments. You and your people should take great pride in your accomplishments as well as in your ability to perform them without public acclaim.

1.  This report presents information that may be helpful in arriving at selection/placement decisions. The comments are necessarily tentative and in terms of general assets and liabilities. A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF AGE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC CONTEMPLATED ASSIGNMENTS MAY BE ARRANGED BY CALLING 23052.

2. AGE Comments: Mr. Maksymiec performs poorly on various measures of intellectual ability. (He evidently has a foreign language background which has affected his performance particularly on the verbal tests.) His knowledge of contemporary world-affairs approaches is an average rating in comparison with Agency professional personnel. He also performs fairly well on a test of arithmetic problems. He would appear best suited for an essentially technician level position, which presumably the proposed “Photographer” position would be.

Honorable Frank Horton
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Frank:

Thank you for your letter of May 9 concerning the proposed
clean up of hazardous waste at the Sully's Trucking Site in
Holley, New York. I recognize your continued interest in this
project and your commitment to protecting the health and safety
of your constituents.

The Sully's Trucking Site has been listed on the New York
State Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites since
1983, and currently is classified as a Class 2 site, indicating
a significant threat to public health or the environment and
requiring remedial action. As you know, the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is responsible for
the oversight of inactive hazardous waste disposal site remediation
in New York State.

DEC has been working with the responsible party to develop a
Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) Work Plan for the
Sully's Trucking Site. The RI/FS Work Plan will outline the
necessary studies to characterize the nature and extent of
contamination at the site and will evaluate potential remedial
alternatives to address site contamination. The RI/FS Work Plan
is scheduled for completion this Summer, with the RI/FS scheduled
to be initiated shortly thereafter.

The Sully's Trucking Site is currently undergoing an
expedited site assessment to determine whether there is a potential
for human exposure to site-related contamination through the potable
water supply. If the expedited site assessment identifies a
potential for human exposure, DEC will initiate immediate actions
to eliminate this exposure.

DEC is committed to ensuring that the Sully's Trucking
Site is remediated in a manner that is protective of public health
and the environment. Please contact me if you have any further
questions regarding this site.

Sincerely,

![Signature of the Commissioner]

[NAME]

Dear [NAME]:

Thank you for contacting me regarding the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).

As you may know, FATCA was enacted in 2010 to target non-compliance by U.S. taxpayers using foreign accounts. FATCA requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report to the IRS information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, or by foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest. The Treasury Department and the IRS have worked to develop a coordinated and effective approach to implementing FATCA that reduces burden on FFIs and U.S. payors, while advancing FATCA’s goal of combating tax evasion. This approach includes a series of reciprocal intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) between the United States and partner jurisdictions to facilitate FATCA implementation. Many countries have entered into IGAs with the United States.

On July 21, 2022, the United States and Switzerland signed a declaration confirming their mutual intention to improve the practical implementation of the 2014 IGA between the two countries. The declaration ensures reporting under the IGA will be enhanced in accordance with the latest version of the Model 1 IGA. The declaration also confirms the commitment to continue working together to improve the IGA’s efficiency and effectiveness.

I appreciate your taking the time to write. Because issues related to FATCA are complex and potentially impact individual tax liability, I encourage you to consult with a professional tax advisor.

Sincerely,

[SIGNATURE]

## Dear

I am writing this letter in response to your recent request for information regarding the current state of affairs at our agency. I understand that you are concerned about the lack of progress we have made in achieving our goals, and I want to assure you that we are taking your concerns seriously.

As you know, our agency has been facing a number of challenges in recent years. We have been dealing with budget cuts, staffing shortages, and an increasing workload. Despite these challenges, we have been working hard to improve our performance and achieve our goals.

I am pleased to report that we have made some progress in recent months. We have implemented a number of new initiatives that are designed to improve our efficiency and effectiveness. We have also been working to improve our communication with the public and our stakeholders.

I am confident that we will continue to make progress in the coming months. We are committed to providing the best possible service to the public, and we are always looking for ways to improve our performance.

Thank you for your interest in our agency. I appreciate your support.

Sincerely,

I am directed to refer to your letter dated November 19, 1992, forwarding
the report of the Special Task Force on the Prevention of Fraud and Mismanagement
in Federally-Funded Research (Task Force). Your letter and the Task Force report
were referred to the Department of Justice for review and comment.

The Department of Justice has reviewed the Task Force report and offers the
following comments and suggestions. First, with respect to the Task Force's
recommendation regarding the establishment of offices of research integrity in
each of the federal research funding agencies, the Department of Justice suggests that the
Task Force also examine the feasibility of a centralized administrative office
to which allegations of research misconduct can be directed. Such an office
could serve as an initial clearinghouse for allegations of research misconduct,
would be more efficient in terms of federal resources, and would provide greater
uniformity in the investigation of research misconduct cases. Second, with respect to
the Task Force's recommendation regarding the implementation of regulations to
require institutions receiving federal funding to establish procedures for
assuring the integrity of research, the Department of Justice suggests that the
Task Force also address the issue of whether these regulations should also provide
that institutions report research misconduct cases to the funding agencies in a timely
manner and that institutional procedures provide for the confidentiality of
information provided by whistleblowers. Finally, the Department of Justice is
concerned that the Task Force report does not address the issue of the role of the
Department of Justice in prosecuting research misconduct cases. The Department
of Justice suggests that the Task Force clarify the respective roles of the
federal research funding agencies and the Department of Justice in the investigation
and prosecution of research misconduct cases.

The Department of Justice appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Task
Force report. I hope that the foregoing comments and suggestions are helpful to
you in your efforts to prevent fraud and mismanagement in federally-funded
research.


Sincerely,

[signature]

Assistant Attorney General

This is a letter from the university, and I have received your letter requesting some documents, and after examination, it was found that it is not possible to meet your request, because the regulations do not allow us to issue any document of any student to another party, and the person concerned must come in person or his legal agent, but it is possible to give you the overall grades obtained by the student.

I hope you understand this, with my sincere wishes.

Best regards.

During the period 1957 through 1961, I was employed by the Publications and Services Branch, Office Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Headquarters, Department of the U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

## Mission

Use, setup, arrangement of photographic equipment, techniques, and processes.

Develop, adapt, and create the foregoing in order to be responsive to unprecedented situations that require photographic equipment for situations of extreme conditions. (Weather, radiation, explosion, etc.). Create training films to deal with specific subjects.

Conduct training classes in basic and advanced photography, motion picture, and laboratory procedures.

## Operations

I was responsible for the direction of technician/specialist photographers, concerned with reproduction of film using the most advanced Eastman-Kodak, Bell and Howell, and Houston Peerless printing and processing equipment.

During this phase there was a demand for high production and extreme accuracy in a minimum of time. My responsibilities required me to adapt to changing conditions under adverse conditions to achieve objectives that were required in a matter of hours.

I developed workload schedules based on task/mission requirements, available manpower, and the degree of skill available. The changing tasks and mission objectives required a maximum ability on my part to train personnel to meet the requirements of operating officials.

I established and conducted training classes in the operation and maintenance of equipment.

I developed workload schedules based on task/program/mission requirements, priorities, available manpower, and the degree of skill available.

he was also in charge of supply and transportation for the Office of the
Army Attache.

In the field of photography I consider Mr. MAKSYMIEC to be one
of the outstanding photographers in the Armed Services of the United
States. His work with me was consisten'ly superior both from a technical
viewpoint and from a photographic result viewpomt. None of the assign-
meatss, that I gave Mr. MAKSYMITC were routine, nor were they easy.
Favariably they involved considerable ability, tenacity, diplomacy, and
judgment. He always accomplished his mission. His detailed captions
were usually accurate and valuable, showing a keen insight into the
subject (human or machine) being covered.

His work in photography was so outstanding that at one time at
Addis Ababa, al a request from TIME LIFE Magazines, I consented
for Mr. MAKSIMIRC to complete a photographic report commenced by
Ne. Alfred Eisenstadt, one of the outstanding photographers in the U. S.
Several perges of patares teken by Mr. MAKSTATEC epperred wit
article in LAFE Magazine. His work also was commenced perromily by
the U. S. Aliissador to Ethiopia and by the Emperior Haile Selassie
who awarded him a gold riedai.

Mr. MAKSYMIEC's many skills include outstanding technical ability in every phase of operations in a photographic laboratory.

I have been informed that while working in Washington, at the Pentagon, Mr. MAKSYMIEC has continued to serve the interests of the United States. He has been a lecturer at the Mibtary Assistance Institute, and in that capacity has been officially commended by Brigadier General Henry C. Newion, Director of the Institute.

White I was attending the U. S. Anay War College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1958-1959, Mr. MAKSYMIEC was of considereble assistance to me in the detailed preparation of my thesis: "The Greater Somaliland Movement, a study in the strategic significance to the United States".

Based on my personal observation and knowledge, I feel that Mr. MAKSYMIEC is eminently qualified for specialized work in the field of intelligence. He would be particularly valuable in all phases of photography, and in collection, evaluation, or dissemination of Intelligence. His investigative ability, particularly in the fields of map reading, geography, order of battle, or technical subjects is outstanding. He has the unique ability to collect and assemble pertinent facts and to prepare clear and concise written reports."

Enclosure Ro. 3. Page 1

During the period 1964 through 1956, I was assigned by Army Attache System, G2 Intelligence, Departement of the Army, to conduct, direct, establish photographic center and perform specific photographic assignments in Ethiopia, Africa.

Mission and Tasks

During this period I directed and participated in photography of selected areas, equipments, training film, and selected subjects.

I modified and planned the inststietion of photographic equipments that were faced with sitnations of excessive heat in some instances and of severe low temperatures in others. These conditions were also subject to abnormal influences.

It was essential that I had a thorough familiarity with the mission objectives that would permit me to plan the photographic recording and reporting on film within a minimara of interference with programa operating sequences. This required me to particigde with operating officials, engineers, scientists, as a member of the team in order to detine the capabilities and limitation of cameras and equipment to the total planning of the specific program. This broad knowledge permitted me to utilize my abilities, imagination, and creative ability to fully develop the photographic aspects.

I determined the kind of fiim, position, camera coverage, background, etc. developed-messablond schedules based on moision requirements,
priorities, manpower, and the degraphic aspects.

I reviewed quantity and quality of work performed by means of visual inspection and by discussions with ican leaders, partic ularly where problem arcas existed or the mission was and resursuel scope and objectives.

I was responsible for the procurement of photographic equinenert end supplies necessary for the ession d russion. Tids responsPhitly also included the repair and maintenance of all ecuperea's in vse.

(2) Letter of Appreciation - Service Department to Department of the Army:

"Whether this is information whether you can appropriately pass this letter on to officials concerned in the Department of Defense I do not know. But I do want to write of the strongest sort of commendation of the work of Master Sergeant Myroslav A. Maksymiec, Sergeant Maksymiec, was associated in the Office of the Army Attache here in Addis Ababa, particularly for the purpose of photographic coverage.

It would please me if you would be able to forward this letter of mine to appropriate officials in the Defense Department. I know that Colonel Ivan D. Townsend, who was the Army Attache here during practically all of Sergeant Maksymiec's service, would agree with me both in my estimate of the Sergeant's usefulness and efficiency and in seeing to it that this letter of commendation be endorsed in the Department.

At the present time Sergeant Maksymiec is assigned in the photography laboratory in the Pentagon. Undoubtedly he is making a fine contribution there. I do know that he was of vast importance to our total American operation here in Ethiopia, not only military, while he was stationed with the Army Attache in Addis Ababa. He is a competent, cooperative, and persistent workman in attaining desired goals. His photographic output is way above average, both in quantity and quality. The Army Attache system, based on my observation of Sergeant Maksymiec's work in Ethiopia, stands in very great debt to him."

Service to Department of Army - Intelligence:

"During his recently competed tour of duty in the office of the
Army Attaché, Ethiopia, M/Sgt. Myroslaw A. Maksymice, was able to
make an outstanding contribution to the Engineer intelligence and photo-
graphy holdings on that country. The material he acquired and gave to
the Engineers for reproduction was of quality and quantity far exceeding
that which has normally been received from similar sources.

Considering the nature of the country in which M/Sgt. Maksymiec
-served, the material acquired could only have been obtained as a result of
an enterprising-persistent, and determined effort on his part.

A great number of the photographs taken by M/Sgt. Maksymice
have been retained by the Engineers to be used in Engineer intelligence
studies. Favorable comments following his debriefing were due largely
to the accurate and current information supplied by him.

Since satisfaction of Engineer requirements undoubtedly con-
stituted only part of the overall action of the Attache, Ethiopia, M/Sgt:
Maksymice's alertness and enthusiasm towards collection of materials
of Engineer interest are greatly appreciated. He has made an invaluable
contribution to the Engineer Intelligence and mapping effort.

It is requested that this letter be made a part of M/Sgt. Maksymiec's
official records."

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIE! OF FORMER FBI
INSPECTOR DONALD E. MOORE
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

This memorandum and its enclosure contain information concerning an interview on July 28, 1975, of former FBI Inspector Donald E. Moore by Mr. Loch Johnson, SSC Staff Member. Mr. Moore entered on duty with the FBI on March 10, 1941, and served continuously in a variety of assignments until his retirement on June 29, 1973.

On advance notice from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Ibore vas advised that i'r. Johnson desired to interview him at Mr. bore's convenience relative to his knowledge of the Huston Report. Mr. Moore was advised that he was being released from any applicable employment agreement for purposes of the SSC interview concerning the Huston Report. It was explained to him that he had the right to counsel; however, the FBI would be unable to provide private counsel. Ile was also advised that there were certain privileged areas concerning which he would not be required to answer questions. These areas concerned information which might divulge the identities of FBI sources; information relating to sensitive methods and techniques; information which might adversely effect ongoing FBI investigations; and information originating with other agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Moore vas advised that if he desired an FDI representative to be available for consultation at the time and place of the interview, one would be supplied. Mr. Moore commented that

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI INSPECTOR BY SSC

this would not be necessary but indicated that if necessary he might contact a Bureau representative telephonically if a matter requiring consultation should come up during the interview. Mr. Moore subsequently contacted Mr. Johnson and made arrangements to be interviewed in Mr. Moore's office on July 28, 1975.

On July 31, 1975, Mr. Moore voluntarily furnished the attached memorandum which he prepared subsequent to his interview with Mr. Johnson.

NOTE:

Mr. Moore's memorandum concerning the interview was voluntarily furnished to SA L. F. Schwartz.

# Interview of Donald E. Moore by
Mr. Loch Johnson, Senate Select Committee
July 28, 1975

Mr. Johnson stated at the outset that this was an informal interview and he did not place me under oath. He asked about my background which was provided him and included the fact that I served in the FBI from March 10, 1941, until my retirement at the end of June 1973.

The interview concerned the so-called Huston Committee and he asked if I knew Tom Charles Huston before the Committee was established. I said I recalled meeting Huston once, in Bill Sullivan's office, but I didn't recall when this was, but it was before the Committee was formed. In response to questions, Mr. Johnson was informed as follows:

I was aware of the meeting at the White House attended by Director Hoover, Mr. Helms, Admiral Gayler and Gen. Bennett. I was probably aware the meeting was to take place before the meeting date but I can't recall this. (He said the meeting was held June 5, 1970.) I was not at a meeting held in Mr. Hoover's office June 8 but I recall hearing about the meeting, probably from Bill Sullivan. I don't recall a meeting held in the Domestic Intelligence Division after this at which Sullivan, Bill Cregar, George Moore, Fred Cassidy and I were present. I did attend the initial meeting of the Working Group headed by Sullivan and was present because Sullivan asked me to be there. I remember Sullivan and Cregar were at the meeting and I thought one or more other FBI representatives were present. He mentioned George Moore and Fred Cassidy were at the meeting.

I recall Mr. Helms and Mr. Angleton from. CIA were present but did not recall the names of others including the representatives from NSA, DIA and the military services. I recall Sullivan chaired the meeting and that Huston sat at the opposite end of the table. Either Helms or Sullivan announced that Helms probably couldn't stay for the entire meeting but I don't recall Helms leaving, although he did not sit directly at the conference table.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

I can't recall the conversation at the meeting but think that Sullivan outlined the request of the President to study means of getting better intelligence information on new left activities and violent protest movements in the US, especially with regard to possible foreign support. I think Sullivan probably outlined areas of concern and asked representatives present to document where they felt intelligence was lacking, how it could be obtained, who should obtain it and what was needed to obtain it. I said I couldn't at this date recall specific observations or proposals and rather believed the purpose of the meeting was to outline the general problem and ask the representatives to document these and come in with specific recommendations at a subsequent meeting. I am certain Mr. Huston spoke about the purpose of the meeting but I can't recall his comments.

This was the only meeting of the Working Group I attended. I told Mr. Sullivan that if agreeable with him I would not attend subsequent meetings and I thought the FBI had several representatives present and that the thrust was on new left and related activities. As I recall he said "suit yourself." Johnson pressed me on this and I told him this was what I expressed to Sullivan but I also was somewhat uneasy after the first meeting as I did not believe Mr. Hoover was aware of collection efforts that were likely to be recommended. I could not state what FBI members attended subsequent meetings but I believe Charles Brennan and Bill Cregar, and of course, Bill Sullivan, attended as well as some other representatives.

I can't say who drafted the report but was sure it was under Sullivan's direction. During the period of the meetings Deke DeLoach had retired and Sullivan had been appointed Assistant to the Director and moved from the 9th & D Building to the Justice Building. I don't recall when Mr. Hoover's objections to certain of the recommendations were added.. I can't say whether I saw the report prior to the objections being in it but may have; I do recall seeing the report after the objections were in it. I don't know whether Mr. Hoover told Sullivan to put the objections in it but presume Sullivan knew Mr. Hoover's views and put the objections in on this basis. I could not answer the question as to whether Mr. Tolson was the person responsible for having the objections made but felt he would have objected to the initial recommendations.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

I did see the letter from the White House saying the report
had been approved. I believe it was signed by Huston and stated
the President had approved the recommendations. I was aware
Mr. Hoover had either written or seen Attorney General Mitchell
expressing his reluctance and was aware the White House letter was
withdrawn. I din't know why it was withdrawn other than this
occurred after Mr. Hoover went to the Attorney General.

Mr. Johnson asked certain specific questions during or
after the above discussion. He asked what covert mail coverage
was involved since CIA in 1970 was engaged in covert mail inter-
ception. After checking with Mr. Leon F. Schwartz of the FBI,
Mr. Johnson was advised that while I had been released from my
pledge of confidentiality by the FBI in general with regard to the
Huston Committee this matter was under review by the Department
of Justice and I had not been released from my pledge on this
aspect. A similar answer was given to the question about what
was meant by the removal of restrictions on the use of surreptitious
entry of embassies io obiain cryptographic materials.

Mr. Johnson asked if I thought the Huston Committee had
been instigated by Bill Sullivan to more or less force Mr. Hoover
to take a more aggressive stance in intelligence collection. I
answered that I would not like to speculate on this and I could not
make a definite statement yes or no.

He asked why the Working Group met at CIA as opposed to
the FBI and whether this had special meaning. I answered that I
did not think so, that the US Intelligence Board was headed by the
Director of CIA, was concerned with intelligence collection and
met at CIA and also meeting arrangements could probably be better
arranged at CIA in view of parking, conference rooms, etc.

He said Admiral Gayler had stated that he and his predecessor,
Gen. Carter, had tried to get Mr. Hoover to provide more support to
NSA with regard to Communications Intelligence and asked if I was
aware of any such efforts, and if they were in person or in writing.
I said I was aware that Gen. Carter and Adm. Gayler had asked for
support and I believe they might have seen Mr. Hoover personally
and perhaps had written him.

CERTAIN CONSTANT CITIES WERE EXAMINED AND OTHER CITIES WERE SELECTED ON A VARIABLE BASIS. WHEN LETTERS WERE OBSERVED THAT WERE BELIEVED TO MEET THE CRITERIA THEY WERE BROUGHT BACK TO THE NEW YORK OFFICE (NYO) WHERE THEY WERE OPENED AND PHOTOGRAPHED BY THE AGENT CONDUCTING THE Z COVERAGE. THE VOLUME WAS VERY SMALL, PROBABLY CONSISTING OF ABOUT TEN LETTERS IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MACHINE UTILIZED IN THE OPENING WAS PROVIDED AND IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT WHEN A LETTER, BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN SENT BY A SOVIET AGENT WAS OBSERVED, PHOTO COPIES WERE PROVIDED TO HEAD QUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, AS WELL AS, AN INVESTIGATIVE FILE BEING OPENED IN NEW YORK CITY (NYC). THE SIZE OF THE SQUAD HANDLING THIS TOTAL OPERATION WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT TWENTY MEN. IT WAS INDICATED THAT THE POSTAL EMPLOYEES WHOSE NAMES WERE NOT RECALLED MERELY PROVIDED THE MAIL POUCHES AND WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE ROOM DURING THE SCREENING PROCESS.

THESE LETTERS WERE ALSO RETURNED TO THE NYO AND OPENED AND PHOTOGRAPHED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. IN THIS INSTANCE, PHOTOGRAPHS WERE NOT FORWARDED TO HEADQUARTERS BUT WERE FORWARDED TO THE INDIVIDUAL CASE FILE OF THE SOVIET NATIONAL AND THE RESULTS OF THE MAIL INTERCEPT WOULD BE REPORTED TO THE BUREAU AT THE NEXT REPORTING SCHEDULE FOR THAT PARTICULAR CASE. IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT SUCH COVERAGE RESULTED IN THE OPENING OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX LETTERS A DAY.

WITH REGARD TO Z COVERAGE IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT SA KEHOE HAD NO DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF THIS OPERATION BUT HAD BEEN PRESENT IN THE ROOM, IN THE NYO, WHEN MAIL WAS OPENED. NO ESTIMATE COULD BE GIVEN OF THE INCLUSIVE DATES OF COVERAGE OR THE VOLUME OF MAIL.

GENERALLY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THESE OPERATIONS OTHER THAN WHAT
HE READ IN THE PAPERS.

A DIRECT QUESTION WAS ASKED IF SA KEHOE WAS AWARE THAT A
PIECE OF CORRESPONDENCE HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE MEDIA BREAK-IN
INDICATING THAT MAIL OPENINGS WENT ON AS LATE AS L970.. THE
ANSWER WAS GIVEN THAT HE HAD READ THIS STATEMENT IN THE PAPERS,

REPRESENTED A SENSITIVE TECHNIQUE THAT WAS STILL VIABLE.

AT NO POINT IN THE PROCEEDINGS DID SA KEHOE EXCERCISE HIS
RIGHT TO CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE UNDER TE FIFTH AMENDMENT.

# Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

DATE: 7/8/75

Mr. Callahan requested that a research be conducted to determine whether the FBI or the Department of Justice would be authorized to pay for private counsel for employees called to testify before the Senate Select Committee and who desired private counsel.

I advised Mr. Callahan that the position of the FBI and the Department is that we could not provide counsel directly to the individuals because of the potential conflict of interest between the rights of the individual and the duties of our officers. However, I told him that to my knowledge the question concerning whether the Government could pay for private counsel selected by the employee has not been researched. Mr. Callahan therefore requested that the research be conducted.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: 7/23/75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: AUTHORITY OF FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO RETAIN PRIVATE COUNSEL TO REPRESENT EMPLOYEES

Legal Counsel memorandum to you dated 7-8-75 captioned Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, recommended that the Administrative Division and Legal Counsel Division confer and prepare an appropriate response to Mr. Callahan's request that research be conducted to determine whether the FBI or the Department of Justice would be authorized to pay for private counsel for employees who are called to testify before the Senate Select Committee and who desire private counsel. We have also undertaken to present the statutory considerations governing the provision of such representation in a legal proceeding as distinguished from a legislative hearing.

Title 5, United States Code, Section 3106, states:

"Except as otherwise authorized by law, the head of an Executive department or military department may not employ an attorney or counsel for the conduct of litigation in which the United States, an agency, or an employee thereof is a party, or is interested, or for the securing of evidence therefor, but shall refer the matter to the Department of Justice."

This statutory prohibition makes it clear that only the Attorney General has the authority to make a contract for special employment of an attorney. This Bureau, as an agency of the Department of Justice, obviously does not have authority to do that which is denied to Executive departments which are otherwise of coequal stature to the Department of Justice.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

An examination of our budgetary language by representatives of the Administrative Division and this Division does not disclose any explicit or implicit authority which would qualify as "otherwise authorized by law, . . ." under the above statute. The statutory authority for provision of private counsel is contained in Title28, United States Code, Section 515, which gives the Attorney General the authority to appoint and pay special attorneys. However, this authority is circumscribed by the statement that these attorneys "may, when specifically directed by the Attorney General, conduct any kind of legal proceeding, civil or criminal, including grand jury proceedings and proceedings before committing magistrates, which United States Attorneys are authorized by law to conduct. . . ." It is evident then that this authority pertains only to proceedings held within the judicial system, not to hearings held before a legislative body. Such a hearing is not a "legal proceeding" and is not one "which United States Attorneys are authorized by law to conduct. . . ."

In the event that employees need representation in a legal proceeding and the Department believes that a potential conflict of interest would prevent it from providing counsel, outside counsel could be appointed and paid under the statute up to the monetary limits fixed. Whether the Department would allow the individual employee to designate or select the outside counsel would be a matter of Departmental policy but we see no reason why such an individual selection would not ordinarily be approved.

We are aware that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has recently engaged the law firm of Arnold and Porter and that Mr. Mitchell Rogovin of that firm has been designated as the individual attorney to represent that agency. Inquiry with CIA has determined that the authority relied on for this action is Title 50, United States Code, Section 403j, which states:

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

"(a) Notwithstanding any other
other provisions of law, sums
made available to the Agency
by appropriation or otherwise
may be expended for purposes
necessary to carry out its
functions, including --

"(1) personal services, including
personal services without regard
to limitations on types of
persons to be employed. . . "

We would emphasize, however, that the counsel hired represents the CIA, not individual employees, and that private counsel has the same problems as does their "in-house" counsel. Therefore, no firm or individual hired by that agency can provide counsel to the individual employee in any situation which presents a potential conflict between the interests of the individual and the interests of the agency.

CONCLUSION:

We conclude that there is no authority for either the FBI or the Department to pay for private counsel selected by employees called to testify before the Senate Select Committee or any other legislative body. If an employee called to testify in such a forum desires private counsel, or where a potential conflict of interest makes representation by "in-house" counsel or the Department impossible, the employee must decide if the possible consequences warrant the personal expense of such counsel and, if so, responsibility for payment rests with him.

Furthermore, private counsel retained by an agency having authority to do so would be under the same disabilities as "in-house" or Departmental counsel in situations presenting a potential conflict of interest.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: Authority of FBI and Department of Justice
to Retain Private Counsel to Represent Employees

The only authority for payment by the Department of
private counsel would be in a legal proceeding in the
judicial system under Title 28, United States Code,
Section 515.

None. For information.

This memorandum records Bureau waiver from sedrecy agreement for interview of Atlanta Field Office (FO) SA Edward A. Shea by Senate Select Committee (SSC) Staff Members at Atlanta, 7/22-23/75.

Supervisor S. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project was in Atlanta 7/22/75 in connection with the interviews there of six SAs (five from Atlanta FOB; one who traveled to Atlanta from Knoxville FO) by SSC Staff Members Michael Epstein and Mary DeOreo. Interviews concerned the former FBI investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr. At approximately 5:00 p.m., 7/22/75, Epstein telephonically contacted Phillips and advised that one of the interviews developed information resulting in his desire to interview a seventh SA, Edward A. Shea of the Atlanta FO. In order to avoid another trip to Atlanta, Epstein asked if Phillips could obtain FBI clearance for the interview which would concern: (1) any possible COINTELPRO operations in Atlanta with respect to King or the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); (2) Shea's assignment to a "file review or file retrieval" project during past year concerning COINTELPRO; and (3) concerning COINTELPRO "generally." (It should be noted that earlier this year, Shea handled a project relating to classifying documents in Atlanta files regarding COINTELPRO. Shea advised. Phillips of this and also said that he does not recall seeing any documents regarding COINTELPRO/SCLC - KING.) Epstein desired to interview Shea the morning of 7/23/75.

On basis of foregoing request, Phillips telephonically contacted Assistant Director (AD) Mintz who granted clearance for (1) and (2) above and suggested withholding clearance on (3) pending further request from Epstein after interview on items (1) and (2). Mintz asked that Phillips touch base with AD Wannall for his concurrence. In the absence of Wannall who was out of the building, Deputy AD T. Leavitt concurred with Mintz. At about 5:30 p.m., 7/22/75, Epstein was telephonically advised by Phillips as indicated above--clearance for (1) and (2); not for (3) at this time. Arrangements were then made for interview of Shea morning of 7/23/75.

Subsequent interview of Shea (being reported separately) apparently satisfied Epstein and it does not appear there will be any further request as to item (3).

ACTION:

None. For information.

This memorandum records that no effort is being made to respond to a request of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) dated 6/27/75, pursuant to instructions of the Deputy Attorney General, until such time as the Department can obtain clarification from the SSC regarding the meaning of paragraph 2 in the SSC's letter of 6/27/75.

Memorandum Wannall to Adams, dated 6/30/75, reviewed a draft copy of the SSC's letter to the Department. This draft copy is dated 6/25/75. It is identical in content with the final version dated 6/27/75.

Memorandum Cregar to Wannall, dated 7/2/75, reported the results of a meeting in the office of the Deputy Attorney General on the morning of 7/2/75. In this memorandum it was pointed out that the Deputy Attorney General found considerable difficulty in understanding paragraph 2 of the SSC's draft of a letter dated 6/25/75. He noted that in view of the ambiguities found in the letter, as well as the lack of any specific agreement entered into with the SSC by the Department and/or the FBI, the Department should prepare a letter over the Attorney General's signature asking for clarification. In the meantime, the Deputy Attorney General advised that we should take no action responsive to the requests levied on the FBI in this letter. To date, we have received no information from the Department that a letter asking for clarification of the SSC has been sent.

SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES
(PURSUANT TO S. RES.21, 4TH CONGRESS)

WASHINGTON.D.C. 20510

June 27, 1975

The Honorable Edward H. Levi
Attorney General
U. S. Department of Justice
Washington, D. C. 20530

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Enclosed with this letter are notifications concerning certain matters currently uncer investigation by the Select Committee which relate to government entities under your jurisdiction.

These notifications are submitted pursuant to an agreement between the Committee, the various intelli- gence entities, and the White House. Pursuant to that agreement, the various entities in the Executive Branch have agreed not only to make available the pertinent witnesses, but also to submit in response all information and material which they possess that is relevant to the areas and cases which the Committee wishes to investigate. The response should include all relevant underlying documentation and other information, including documents which may not have come to the Committee's attention and which the Committee has not specifically requested, and all material relating to any prior Executive Branch inquiry into the matter. In addition, we would welcome a current analysis of the particular questions raised by the Commit- tee and any other observations on the sinject that you believe would be helpful.

We welcome the promise of cooperation and full disclosure that underlies that agreement. Success in fui- filling the full disclosure policy contained in the agreem ment is indispensible to the Committee's analysis and-to the formulation of our ultimate findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

ENCLOSURE 62-116395-537


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 37

The Honorable Edward H. Levi
Page Two
June 27, 1975

Within the Committee mandate, contained in S. Res. 21, there are four broad subjects relating to the intelligence community which we are required to investigate and study in order to determine the facts and ultimately to decide whether to make recommendations for legislative or other changes. They are:

1. The structure, performance, and utility of government operations with respect to intelligence activities.

2. Whether certain policies or practices are or are not illegal, unethical, or otherwise improper.

3. Whether there has or has not been excessive duplication or inadequate coordination between and among intelligence agencies and, more generally, the efficiency of intelligence activities.

4. Whether there has or has not been adequate internal and external control and oversight over the policies and practices of intelligence agencies.

In attempting to find the answers to these fundamental questions, the Committee is proceeding in two ways. First, we are examining intelligence functions broadly as instruments of government policy, giving attention to the authority for particular functions, the problems which intelligence activities are designed to solve, the procedures by which intelligence activities are and have been proposed, approved, executed, evaluated, and terminated, the range and scope of the activities utilized to achieve intelligence objectives, and the propriety and utility of the activities undertaken. Second, we will examine in depth certain subjects within the broad topics of investigation. (We would, of course, welcome your suggestion of other cases that would give added insight into intelligence matters under your jurisdiction.) These specific subjects for investigation are not intended to limit the scope contained in the more general questions.

specific questions, set forth certain previously requested
documents not yet received, request additional documents, *
and, in some cases, ask for the names and present addresses
of persons who have held certain positions. Where appro-
priate, the subject's description indicates that, pursuant
to the agreed Outline for Inquiry Procedures, the matter

# FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (INCLUDING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE)

I. Issues

The Committee's inquiry into the intelligence and counterintelligence activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining fundamental issues which bear directly on the adequacy of current legislation and administrative organization and procedure. The Committee seeks to determine whether FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities achieve legitimate objectives in conformity with the rule of law. Among the basic issues to be addressed are the following:

A. What is the legal authority for FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities? Should the FBI's authority be clarified or revised or incorporated in a comprehensive statutory charter?

B. What limitations are placed on FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities by the Constitution and laws of the United States? Should these limitations be clarified or revised?

C. What have been the purposes and aims of FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities? Should these objectives be modified?:

D. How have the intelligence and counterintelligence activities of the FBI been organized and coordinated with other agencies of government? Should these procedures and practices be revised?

E. What have been the procedures for and techniques of intelligence gathering and dissemination and counterintelligence operations used by the FBI? Under what conditions and through what procedures should these methods and techniques be used in the future?

F. What have been and should be the mechanisms for internal and external policy-making, control, and supervision of FBI intelligence and counter- intelligence activities?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

- 2 -

As a means of examining the above issues in the context of actual FBI intelligence operations, the Committee intends to study certain specific topics, some of which are general in nature, and others of which involve specific cases, programs or techniques. Part II, below, contains descriptions of the general areas into which the Committee intends to inquire. Part III contains descriptions of the specific cases mentioned above. The descriptions specifically indicate whether the investigation may concentrate on specific allegations of possible abuses or other controversial matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred. In addition to the topics described below, additional areas of inquiry may develop during the course of the Committee's work.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 43

## II. Areas of General Inquiry

### A. Legal Authority for FBI Intelligence and Counter-intelligence Activities

The Committee is examining the legal basis for FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities. There may be serious question as to the adequacy of the present legislative framework for the FBI's functions in these fields. Current statutes authorize the FBI to perform investigative and law enforcement functions, but they do not specifically authorize intelligence or counterintelligence 'activities. Therefore, the Committee seeks to determine whether the FBI's authority should be clarified, revised, or incorporated in a comprehensive statutory charter.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein

### B. Organization and Operation of the FBI Intelligence Division

The Committee is investigating the structure and operating practices of the FBI Intelligence Division. Proposals have been made that the national security intelligence and counterintelligence functions of the FBI should be lodged in a separate agency or otherwise separated from the FBI's criminal investigative activities. Further recommendations have been advanced for improved coordination between the FBI and other intelligence agencies, for strengthened supervision of FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities by the Attorney General or an independent board, and for clearer standards and procedures for FBI activities in this area. Therefore, the Committee desires complete information on the operating practices and procedures of the FBI Intelligence Division and of the field office activities supervised by the Intelligence Division.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

# 4

The Committee's inquiry focuses on the following specific areas:

1. FBI Internal Security Intelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature and purpose of FBI intelligence operations directed at foreign intelligence activities and subversive or extremist activities within the United States. It has been alleged that the scope of FBI intelligence investigations is too broad and has extended to legitimate political activities. Consequently, the Committee must examine how the FBI's responsibilities have been defined.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein

2. The FBI and the U. S. Intelligence Community

The Committee seeks to determine what have been the policies and procedures for coordination between the FBI and other agencies in the --U. S. intelligence community. There have been occasions in the past where friction between the FBI and other agencies has produced serious dissatisfaction within the U. S. intelligence community. The purpose of this inquiry is to evaluate the adequacy of past and present co-ordinating mechanisms.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 45

3. FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Operations

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of FBI counterintelligence operations directed at foreign intelligence activities within the United States or at any other hostile foreign-related activities within the United States. Since FBI operations to "counter" these activities go beyond intelligence collection, the Committee must consider whether such practices require statutory authorization. The impact of counterintelligence operations on United States foreign relations will also be considered..

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Loch Johnson
Barbara Banoff

4. Inspection Division Investigations

The Committee is examining the relationship of the FBI Inspection Division to FBI intelligence and counterintelligence activities. This includes both regular Inspection Division reviews of Intelligence Division and field office functions and specific investigations of allegations of improper conduct in connection with FBI intelligence activities.

Responsible staff: Senior staff
Task Force leader
Mark Gitenstein


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 46

## 5. FBI Intelligence Activities and State or Local Law Enforcement Agencies

The Committee seeks to determine the nature of the relationships between FBI intelligence activities and state and local law enforcement agencies. This subject involves the delicate balance between the necessary centralization of certain law enforcement activities and the Constitutionally-mandated decentralization of general law enforcement responsibility. It is necessary for the Committee to evaluate the centralizing influence of the FBI, as well as the FBI's role as a check on local law enforcement abuses.

## Case Studies

### General Questions

The descriptions which follow of the specific cases the Committee intends to study are, intended to serve the dual purpose of notifying the FBI of the issues the Committee will explore in connection with each case and eliciting from the FBI all information and material in its possession relating to the questions the Committee wishes to explore in each case. In order to avoid unnecessary repetition of certain questions which will be basic to the Committee's investigations of each case, certain fundamental questions are set forth below. As to each case described, the Committee intends to explore these fundamental.questions, and expects that the FBI will, as to each case, provide all information and material it has relating to these basic questions even though they are not repeated in the discussion of each particular area.

1. What is or has been the legal authority for the activity?

2. What have been the purposes of the activity?

3. What techniques have been employed in the activity?

4. What kinds of information have been gathered in the activity?

5. How have specific uses of the activity been initiated and approved?

6. How have the targets for the activity been selected?

7. What have been the criteria for target selection?

8. How has the intelligence which is collected been used?

9. To whom has the intelligence collected been disseminated?

10. What has been the basis for any dissemination with respect to each recipient?

11. How has the activity been coordinated with other intelligence agencies?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 48

- 8 -

12. What have been the effects of this coordination?

13. To what extent has each of the foregoing been compatible with the legal authority for and the purposes of the activity?

14. By what means has the activity been monitored, controlled and administered?

15. What are the potential abuses to which the activity may lead?

16. To what abuses has the activity led?

17. What steps have been taken to investigate such abuses?

18. What steps have been taken to avoid such abuses?

19. What have been the costs and utility of the activity?

In some instances, the specific questions set forth below may appear to repeat some of the general questions. The purpose in such cases is simply to clarify the application of the general question to the specific case. Except where inapplicable by their terms, all general questions relate to each specific case.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 49

# Electronic Surveillance

The Committee is examining all forms of electronic interception of communications including wiretapping, electronic eavesdropping, consensual electronic surveillance interception of video and data communications, local monitoring devices, and all other forms of electronic or technical monitoring. The Committee's general questions apply to each of the techniques listed above, as well as to the matters set forth in the following specific cases.

1. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance

The Committee seeks to determine whether the Attorney General should have the authority to authorize electronic surveillance for certain purposes without a prior judicial warrant. This power has been exercised by succeeding Attorneys General since 1940, upon the explicit directive of the President. The Supreme Court has ruled that this power does not extend to purely domestic matters, but the remaining scope of the Attorney General's authority remains undefined by the Supreme Court.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice Department address the following specific questions:

a. What is the scope and basis of the claim of Executive authority to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance?

b. What have been the procedures for consideration and approval of requests for warrantless electronic surveillance authorized by the Attorney General?

c. What are the specific disadvantages of the judicial warrant requirement for those electronic surveillances which have been authorized by the Attorney General?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

 - 10 -

d. Does the Fourth Amendment permit the issuance of judicial warrants for electronic surveillance on grounds other than ordinary probable cause where national security intelligence purposes are advanced to justify the surveillance?

e. To what extent are the specific procedures of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968 inappropriate for electronic surveillance conducted for national security intelligence purposes?

Documents

The Committee requests the following additional documents bearing on the questions stated above:

a. All written justifications for the specific authorizations by the Attorney General for warrantless electronic surveillance from January 1, 1960, until the present.

b. All documents reflecting the denial by the Attorney General of specific requests for warrantless electronic surveillance from January 1, 1960, until the present.

c. Committee staff access to information contained in the impounded documents, depositions, and other materials in all pending civil suits which involve warrantless electronic surveillance and in which the Committee has received the consent of the plaintiffs for such access.

2. Warrantless Electronic Surveillance and "Leaks"

The Committee is examining several instances of the use of warrantless electronic surveillance and other investigative techniques in connection with "leaks" of classified information. These cases may involve specific allegations of abuse or other controversial matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred. These instances include:

a. The investigation of alleged "leaks" by or to 17 Executive officials and newsmen between May 1969 and February 1971.

b. The investigation of alleged "leaks" from a military staff member assigned to the National Security Council in 1971-72.

c. The reported investigation of columnist Joseph Kraft in 1969.

d. The reported investigation of the activities of Mrs. Anna Chennault and Vice Presidential candidate Spiro Agnew in 1968.

e. Any other instances of warrantless electronic surveillance in connection with the investigation of "leaks" to the press.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice Department address the following specific questions:

a. Through what procedures and by whom were each of these electronic surveillances authorized and approved, continued, and terminated?

b. As to each person to whom information was disseminated, please state:

(1) The nature of the information.

(2) The basis for the dissemination.

NW 88326 Docld:32989627 Page 51


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 52

(3) The date of each dissemination.

(4) The use which was in fact made of the information by the recipient.

c. What evaluations were made of the original grounds for the surveillance as it progressed?

d. What were the results of the evaluations?

e. Who made them?

f. What are the reasons for use of electronic surveillance without judicial warrant to investigate "leaks" of classified information to the press?

g. How does each of the above instances relate to these reasons?

h. To what extent would requirement of a warrant interfere with the ability to detect such leaks?

3. Surveillance of Dr. Martin Luther King

This investigation examines the authorization for, conduct and termination of, and deliberations regarding the surveillance of Dr. King. This case may involve specific allegations of abuses and other controversial matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice Department address the following specific questions:

a. Through what procedures and by whom were wiretaps and electronic bugs of Dr. King initiated, approved, continued, and terminated?

b. What were the locations, extent, and duration of the electonic surveillances of Dr. King?

c. What were the grounds of national security, if any, for the introduction of the electronic surveillances of Dr. King?

d. What was the relationship between the information collected and each of the purposes of the surveillance?

e. What evaluations were made of the original grounds for the surveillance as it progressed?

f. What were the results of those evaluations?

# Clandestine Informant Activities

The Committee is examining all aspects of the FBI's use of informants, sources, and undercover personnel and the techniques employed by such persons. Although informants are the single most productive source of intelligence information, the difficulties of controlling their activities may increase the possibility of improper conduct. The use of informants to infiltrate organizations also may pose dangers to the right of associational privacy. Consequently, proposals have been made for the imposition of a judicial warrant requirement or other safeguards for the use of informants. The Committee seeks to evaluate such proposals as well as the contributions of informants to the accomplishment of legitimate objectives.

In addition, the Committee is examining informant activities with respect to several particular situations and cases. This investigation may involve specific allegations of abuse or controversial matters where there is reason to believe improprieties may have occurred. The Committee's inquiry covers the general circumstances surrounding the following incidents or cases:

a. Wounded Knee;

b. Kent State;

c. New York v. Stroble (Attica);

d. United States v. Buckalew (Gainesville);

e. United States v. Briggs (Camden);

f. New York v. Dillon (Hobart College);

g. United States v. Marshall (Seattle).

Additional cases may also be examined.

In addition to the above cases, the Committee is examining the role of FBI informants in providing information to the FBI concerning members of the following organizations:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 65

- 25 -

a. Ku Klux Klan;

b. Students for a Democratic Society;

c. Weathermen;

d. Black Panther Party;

e. Communist Party USA;

f. W.E.B. DuBois Clubs.

Additional studies of informant activities with respect to members of other organizations may be formulated.

## Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice Department address the following specific questions:

1.  With respect to both categories of cases listed above, what allegations, whether unfounded or not, of improper, illegal, unethical, or provocative conduct by FBI informants have been made in connection with these situations or groups?

2.  What measures has the FBI taken to investigate such allegations of misconduct and to prevent such alleged misconduct from taking place in the future?

3.  What instructions has the FBI given to its informants with respect to possible improper, illegal, unethical, or provocative conduct?

4.  What has been the largest number of informants, sources, and undercover personnel in use at any one time during each year from 1960 until the present in connection with security, intelligence, and counterintelligence matters, cases, and programs?

5.  What has been the annual total amount of funds (including reimbursement for expenses) paid to informants and sources for each year from 1960 until the present?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 66

- 26 -

6. What limits, if any, have been placed on the type of information which informants have been intrusted to report back to the FBI?

7. What have been the annual percentage of potential informants who became paid informants in connection with security, intelligence, and counterintelligence matters, cases, and programs from 1960 until the present?

Documents

Please provide a summary of ten cases (for each of the following categories) where the FBI's use of informants, sources, or undercover personnel resulted in:

1.  the conviction of an espionage agent of a foreign government.

2. the prevention of the theft of national security information.

# G. "Notional" Organizations

The Committee is examining the FBI's alleged creation of the support for "notional" organizations for intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Although it may rely upon informants and other clandestine operatives, this alleged practice is sufficiently novel to require separate attention.

## Questions

The Committee requests that the FBI and the Justice Department address the following specific questions:

1.  What groups, organizations, movements, or other associations has the FBI caused directly or indirectly to be formed or created for intelligence or counterintelligence purposes? Please provide a complete list from January 1, 1960, to the present.

TO : W. Raymond Wannall
Assistant Director, Intelligence Division DATE: August 13, 1975.
Federal Bureau of Investigation

FROM : Douglas R. Marvin
Counselor to the Attorney General

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee Request for Information
on Warrantless Electronic Surveillances

In accord with our telephone conversation of August 12th, I am forwarding to you a letter from the Senate Select Committee requesting answers to questions relating to electronic surveillance conducted by the Federal government in the interests of national security. The Committee has been told that we would try to respond to their request by August 20th. That date is fast approaching and may not be a reasonable period of time in which to compile the information requested and respond to their questions. That date is a useful target. however since any issues to be presented to the Attorney General with respect to complying to this request must be considered prior to August 19th, the date the Attorney General is scheduled to leave Washington.

Would your office please prepare responses to the following questions that involve areas with which, I believe, you are familiar: questions 2-10, 11(b)-(d), 12, 14, 15, 17, 21 and 24.

Thank you.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Thank you for your letters of June 24 and June 25, 1975 relating to electronic surveillance conducted by the federal government in the interests of national security and foreign intelligence. The Select Committee also appreciates your providing the information of a sensitive nature in your separate latter of June 24, 1975.

Your letters, and the recent testimony of Kevin T. Maroney and Clarence M. Kelley before the House Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties, and the Administration of Justice, have raised several additional questions which the Committee wishes to pursue. Further questions are raised by the July 1, 1975, White House news briefing by the Press Secretary relating to the effect of the recent Zweibon decision. Some of these questions relate to general policy considerations in the electronic surveillance area; others address our need for a more complete factual base from which we can draw our conclusions. A list of these questions is attached to this letter. These questions, of course, do not supersede prior requests for material relating to electronic surveillance, which are itemized in the document requests of May 14, June 16, and June 27. Rather, they should be considered as supplementary to the prior requests.

I believe that the answers to these questions are essential to a complete understanding of the policies and procedures followed by the Justice Department in electronic surveillance cases. Full information on these matters is necessary for the Committee to fulfill its mandate "to recommend the enactment of any new legislation necessary or desirable to strengthen or clarify the national security, intelligence, or surveillance activities of the United States and to protect the rights of United States citizens with regard to these activities." With the continued cooperation of the Justice Department, I am convinced that the Committee will be able to discharge this responsibility in the critical area of national security electronic surveillance.

Sincerely,

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

At the outset Mr. Croscioli was informed of his rights; namely, that he did have a right to an attorney, that the interview was entirely voluntary and that he could refuse to answer any questions asked of him. The interview included the following questions asked by Messrs. Dick and Wallach which are deened pertinent:

In order to assess the experience of Special Agent Crescioli, his prior Cureau background was requested. Mr. Crescioli responded that he entered on duty as a Special Agent in September, 1954, and served in five field offices handling both criminal and security matters prior to his assignment to FBI Headquarters. During the period 1062-73, Mr. Crescioli was assigned as an FBI Headquarters Supervisor handling substantivo cases in the internal security area. From 1973 to November, 1974, he was assigned to the Foreign Liaison Unit of the Liaison Section, and from November, 1974, to the presont, he has been assigned to the Domestic Liaison Unit handling liaison specifically with the military and U. S. Postal Service.

Messrs. Wallach and Dick wore most interested in ascertaining the procedure followed by Mr. Crescioli to secure authority to be present at this interview. He was specifically queried as to the names of the individuals who authorized his attendance and what comments or instructions, if any, those Dureau officials gave him. Mr. Crescioli responded by stating that upon receiving a telephone call from Mr. Dick requesting his appearance, a memorandun setting forth this request was prepared by Mr. Crescioli and "walked through" various Durosu lovols for approval. The idontities of Lureau officials approving the memorandum were made known to these Staff lembors, however, it was pointed out to them that no particular comment of pertinence to instant matter was recalled by Mr. Crescioli ns having been made by any of these officials.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

To the question as to what problems have been experienced by Mr. Crescioli with the Postal Servico since assuming his role of Liaison Officer, Mr. Crescioli responded that cooporation with the Postal Servico has beon excellent and no real problems have been encountered. Mr. Crescioli explained that he has visited the Postal Inspection Service on the average of once every two weeks since November, 1974. He added that on occasion ho will be telephoned by an official of the Inspection Service with a question regarding a national security mail cover requested by the FBI, a question regarding training procedures or a question regarding handling of Freedom of Information Act requests. In his liaison capacity, Mr. Crescioli would initiate the necessary arrangements to have these questions resolved and the answer returned to the Postal Inspection Service. In this same area of conversation, Mr. Wallach asked Mr. Crescioli if he ever visited the Postal Inspection Service to meroly "chat" with the Postal Inspectors. Mr. Crescioli responded that because of his heavy liaison responsibilities with agencies other than the Postal Service he did not have tine to visit tho Postal Service for other than official reasons.

When asked if the various FBI field offices have liaison representatives with the various Regional Postal Inspectors in Charge, Mr. Crescioli responded that with regard to national security mail covers, the Special Agent in Charge of the local FBI office is the designated Buroau liaison contact with the Regional Postal Inspector in Chargo.

The above Staff Members were interested in ascertaining whether or not national security mail cover checks were routed through Mr. Crescioli prior to delivery to the Chief Postal Inspector. Mr. Crescioli responded that these mail cover requests are not routed through him for review but rather are routed through normal Dureau channels prior to delivery by Courier Service to the Chief Postal Inspector.

Through arrangements made by Mr. John Hotis, Legal Counsel Division, (Unit Chief Homer A. Newman) IS-1 Section, Intelligence Division, was interviewed for the purpose of developing general information regarding the handling of informant files within the FBI by Mr. John T. Elliff and Mr. Mark Gitenstein of the Domestic Intelligence Task Force U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. The interview was conducted on 8/4/75 in FBI space and lasted from approximately 2:00 p.m. until 2:30 p.m.

The interview was extremely general in nature and dealt exclusively with general information regarding the handling of informant files both in the field and at FBIHQ. The questions asked dealt with such matters as what type of files were maintained in the field and at FBIHQ regarding informants and generally the types of information contained therein. They were particularly interested as to whether or not an individual informant file either at FBIHQ or in the field would contain information which would specifically identify informants other than the informant on which the file was maintained. They also inquired whether or not there was a sub A section of each informant file maintained at FBIHQ as was the case in the field. Questions were also asked as to whether or not the individual file maintained at FBIHQ on informants would run into several volumes. This inquiry was answered to the effect that the size of the file would depend on the activity of the informant, how long he had been operated, etc.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy

It was readily apparent that they were asking these questions with the thought in mind of requesting access to certain informant files, the identity of which they already had but did not divulge. They did state specifically that the informant files in which they would have an interest amounted to approximately ten and were all on informants that had publicly been exposed for one reason or another and were no longer being operated as current informants. The indication was that the request would be for access only to such files for review in FBI space.

Memorandum

TO: Mr. J. B. Adams

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: PROPOSED PROCEDURES FOR ACCESS
TO FBI MATERIALS BY THE SENATE
SELECT COMMITTEE

DATE: 7/24/75

1 - Mr. Wannall

1 - Mr. Cregar

1 - Mr. Hotis

Attn: Mr. Daly

1- Mr. Mintz

On the afternoon of July 24, 1975, K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel in the Department, met with Deputy Associate Director Adams and me to present us with a copy of the proposed procedures and to discuss any amendments the Bureau might request. I asked Mr. O'Connor who had approved this latest draft of the proposed procedures and he said that they had been tentatively approved by the Attorney General and the White House. I specifically asked him who in the White House had approved them and he said that they had been approved by Mr. Buchen (Counsel to the President).

Mr. Adams and I discussed the procedures with Mr. O'Connor and suggested to him as indicated by my inked notation on the bottom of page 2A that the word "use" used in subparagraph (d) should be further defined by a footnote that would specify the limitations on information to be provided the Committee and its staff concerning the identities of persons to whom the FBI has undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. Mr. O'Connor agreed to the proposed change and in our presence telephonically communicated with John Elliff and obtained his concurrence in the amendment to sub-paragraph (d).

Mr. Adams told Mr. O'Connor that the FBI was not agreeing to the procedures in substance but that we recognized the authority of the Attorney General in these matters and would abide by his decision that the proposed procedures would be implemented on agreement by the Committee. Mr. O'Connor said he understood that and he advised John Elliff that the Bureau had acquiesced in the proposed procedures with the one amendment described above. Mr. O'Connor departed indicating that he was going to proceed to meet with the Committee and obtain final agreement as to the text of the proposed procedures. The draft of the procedures is attached for the Director/s/information.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Proposed Procedures for Access to
FBI Materials by SSC

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum and the proposed draft of the proposed procedures be forwarded for the information of the Director.

- 2 -


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 113

## PROPOSED PROCEDURES

(1) The Domestic Task Force Leader will submit periodically a list pertaining of *specific* materials, relevant to the inquiry being conducted under S.R. 21, to which Committee staff wishes access or of which the specificity, Committee desires delivery. Any questions as to the scope or meaning of any portion of such list shall be identified by the Special Counsel and discussed at the time of acceptance of the list, between the DTFL and the Special Court.

The first such list will be delivered to the Department of Justice within 48 hours of the adoption of this procedure, and will summarize and supersede all the presently outstanding requests; this list will be in priority order, as fixed by the Committee, with fixed delivery/access date specified. Those materials for which the Committee requests delivery or access shall be delivered to the Committee or made accessible in Room 4171 of the Hoover Building not later than within 48 96 hours of the date specified. The Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman shall be informed by the Attorney General, within 24 hours of receipt of each request, of any delay beyond 48 96 hours, the expected length of the delay, and the specific reasons for the delay. Partial access or delivery shall be proffered, by the Bureau of/to any materials requested, while the balance of such materials are being prepared. A partial proffer shall not extend the time of full response set forth herein.

*Wherever used herein, the term Domestic Task Force Leader (DTFL) Staff Director, is understood to include the Chief Counsel and the Minority Counsel of the Senate Select Committee.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 114

- 2 -

These procedures shall apply to all matters covered by paragraph 1. In the event of a specific problem arising with the applicability of these procedures to any matters in current litigation or any matter in which criminal prosecution is pending, or any matter which the Attorney General shall specifically designate as extraordinarily sensitive, a special procedure shall be undertaken.* Such specific problem areas shall be identified by the Attorney General to the Chairman and Vice Chairman by letter upon consideration of the lists submitted pursuant to this provision. The special procedure to be followed shall be proposed, defined, adopted, and followed after consideration by the SSC of the specific problem area and pertinent inquiry and discussion at the staff level.

(2) The following procedures shall apply (a) where delivery of materials requested might jeopardize FBI sensitive sources or ongoing operations, or (b) where the Domestic Task Force Leader requests access to materials, rather than delivery to the SSC.

(3) The Department will furnish access at the Hoover Building in Room 4171 to those materials requested:

(a) only to the members of the Committee, where it is determined by the Attorney General that the materials involve peculiarly sensitive foreign intelligence sources or peculiarly sensitive ongoing foreign intelligence operations.

* No restriction of currently operational arrangements is intended under this provision.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 115

2A

(b) In all other cases, to the appropriately cleared staff who will have access to all of the materials.

(c) An exception to (a) and (b) above is made for the identities of so-called "live" informants or potential informants as defined in the FBI Manual of Instructions as to which no access will be furnished unless the identity of the individual as an informant or potential informant has already been made known to the Committee, jointly agree on the limited disclosure of such identities to the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

(d) As to other information which would identify persons, as sources, who have provided or continue to provide information to the FBI, and as to whose identity the FBI has undertaken an obligation of confidentiality, the Committee and its staff shall preserve the confidentiality and shall make no use which would impair the confidentiality of this class of information to which access has been given, unless the identity of the individual as a source has already been made known to the Committee, or unless such information appears in materials which have been screened by the FBI as provided in paragraph 6 below.

Examples of prohibited uses are: (1) interviews of the source; (2) interviews or other inquiries that would disclose the fact the identity of a confidential source was made known to the staff; (3) public disclosure


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 116

- 3 -

(4) Those materials to which the staff has access may be reviewed and studied in Room 4171 of the Hoover Building and such notes may be taken as deemed appropriate by the Staff.

(5) The Comittee staff shall select from these materials to which access is herein provided, those materials which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiries and necessary for delivery to the Committee's offices.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 117

- 4 -

(6) The Bureau shall make copies of such materials as are specified by the staff under the provisions of (5) above for transfer to the Committee's offices

(a) before the copies of such materials are taken to the Committee's offices, the Bureau shall, within 24 hours of the selection, make appropriate excisions and paraphrases of information which might, if inadvertently disclosed, endanger sensitive or sensitive FBI sources and/ongoing operations.

(b) If the Task Force Leader has any objections to the excisions or paraphrases, the materials in issue will be forthwith conveyed by the Bureau, with a written statement of its grounds for its position, to the Special Counsel who shall resolve the matter by negotiation within 24 hours.

(c) In the event the matter is not resolved within 24 hours, the Special Counsel shall submit the matter forthwith to the Attorney General who shall notify the Chairman forthwith and arrange for an appropriate disposition.

(7) The Committee staff may remove to the office of SSC for appropriate use, any notes which they may make upon review of material screened by the FBI, as provided in (6) above, without such notes being reviewed by the Bureau. The Committee staff may remove notes on unscreened materials only if such notes are reviewed and cleared by the Bureau under the provisions of (6) (a) thru (c) above.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 118

- 5 -

(8) The staff and the members of the Committee may examine the original materials to which the staff has been given access as extensively as necessary, in the Hoover Building at Room 4171, during normal FBI business hours; upon reasonable notice, special arrangements may be made for access at other times.

(9) These procedures are adopted subject to satisfactory experience in implementation. If after a fair trial the procedures herein do not operate suitably in the view of either the SSC or the Attorney General, the procedures may be unilaterally set aside by either the SSC or the Attorney General and other appropriate and suitable methods of procedure undertaken.

INFORMATIVE NOTE
Date 8/4/75

In connection with our responses to the Senate Select Committee (SSC), the White House has instructed that the Intelligence Community prepare a briefing for Senators Church and Tower of the SSC regarding warrantless electronic surveillances and surreptitious entries. During meetings of the Intelligence Community, it was agreed that NSA, FBI and CIA would give the briefings. No date has been scheduled for the briefings, although it is anticipated representatives of the White House will monitor a preview of the actual briefing to be given Senators Church and Tower.

During meetings of the Intelligence Community representatives, to discuss the contents of such a briefing, it was agreed among representatives of NSA, CIA and FBI that efforts would be made to avoid identifying specific foreign targets of surreptitious entries or warrantless electronic surveillances.

Attached is a memorandum from CIA advising that CIA has already disseminated to the SSC information concerning sensitive technical operations against certain Embassies and diplomatic establishments in the U.S.

ACTION: For information and record purposes.

DATE: 8/6/75

FROM: Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

On 8/6/75, Daniel M. (Mac) Armstrong, III, who was on the personal staff of former Acting Director Gray, called to advise that he had been contacted by John Elliff. He had known Elliff casually during the confirmation hearings regarding Mr. Gray. Elliff told him that he was personally interested in determining background on two matters which were: (1) the decision to abolish the Crime Records Division; and (2) the Legal Attache program.

Armstrong told him that he had no knowledge concerning the Crime Records Division and had not even learned of its abolishment until after the fact. Armstrong referred Elliff to Dave Kinley regarding that topic. Armstrong said that Elliff did not want to talk to him concerning the Legal Attache program over the phone and said he would contact him in the near future for an appointment to see him personally.

Armstrong said he was passing this information along to us in order to keep us advised of his contacts with the Senate Select Committee concerning his Bureau information which came to him as a result of his Bureau employment.

1. In our discussions preparatory to the briefing to
   be given to Senators Church and Tower, we have agreed to try
   to avoid identifying specific foreign targets of the various
   types of operations which will be discussed, although it was
   generally recognized that it would be impossible to avoid
   discussing the Soviet target specifically. I have recently
   learned that the SSC Staff is aware of the fact (from material
   turned over to them by CIA) that CIA "participated in a series
   of electronic surveillance operations in the U.S." The infor-
   mation is contained in a single paragraph, which goes on to
   say:

"Included among them are operations against the
Czech Embassy, the UAR Embassy, the Chilean Embassy,
the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, the present
Soviet Embassy, the planned Soviet Embassy, and the
quarters occupied by the Chinese Communists in New
York City."

2. This being so, it can be expected that the Staff will
   have brought this information to the senators' attention, and
   I will be prepared to respond factually to questions with re-
   spect to these operations, which of course were carried out in
   pursuit of NSA requirements, and with FBI coordination and/or
   support.

3. Notwithstanding this regrettable breach in the
   ciple we have agreed to try to maintain, I believe we should
   resist pressures to expand on the number of identified targets

Memorandum

TO: Mr. McDermot

FROM: W/L. Bailey DATE: 7831-75

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY - 75

On July 31, 1975, Mr. Dan Dwyer, Research Assistant, Senate Select Committee, advised SA Seymor F. Phillips that he had some specific questions to ask concerning his review of the Classifying Guide, Files and Communications Division. Thereafter, Supervisor Paul F. Shea and Classifying Unit Supervisor Odell Wheeler answered the following questions raised by Mr. Dwyer:

(1) Explain the difference in applicant mail categories, i.e. 67, 77, 116, 151 and 161? The various applicant type categories were discussed with him. (2) What is the difference between main files, general files and setup files? These definitions were given to him in accordance with the manual; in addition, our procedures for handling "O" files, "00" files and subfiles were also explained. (3) When is a 62 file interchangeable? It was explained to him that the 62 classification is interchangeable with other designated classifications, for example, that incoming 62 material could be placed in an existing file on the subject rather than opening a separate 62 file. (4) Describe what you mean by the standard sublist. It was explained that a subnumber is assigned to each one of our field offices and to each foreign country; that subfiles are used when it is anticipated that the volume of mail will be sufficient to place the file in separate subs for future ready reference to a particular area or locality. (5) What is the meaning of the character of a case? It was explained that we have utilized 185 classification numbers to date and that each of these classifications has a corresponding character. The example given was the 26 classification and corresponding ITSMV character.

(6) What is meant by the 134 classification being interchangeable with the subversive list? It was explained to him that from the 185 classifications approximately 60 of these are termed subversive from an administrative standpoint. The 134 classification which designates a security informant is interchangeable with certain subversive classifications on the subversive list.

to the above former employees' knowledge concerning the
"Huston Plan."

This is to advise that both Messrs. Smith and Cotter
have been released from their employment agreement with this
Bureau for the purpose of an interview by the Senate Select
Committee concerning their knowledge of the "Huston Plan."
In response to Mr. Johnson's request, there is set forth below
the last known address for each of the above-named former

NOTE:

Reference is made to Legal Counsel memorandum to J. B. Adams, dated 7/29/75, captioned "Senstudy 75," wherein the request of Mr. Johnson is set forth as well as the approved release of Messrs. Smith and Cotter from their employment agreement as it relates to the "Huston Plan." On 8/4/75 Special Agent Thomas J. McNiff attempted to contact Mr. Smith at his home phone 301-262-1921. An adult female answered and advised that she was baby-sitting for Mr. and Mrs. Smith who are currently in New Mexico and are not expected to return for an additional two weeks. Special Agent McNiff left his nare and office phone number with the request that Mr. Smith call him upon his return to his residence.

Mr. Richard Cotter on 8/4/75 was contacted at his home residence phone 256-7227 and advised of the SSC desire to interview him within the parameter outlined above. Mr. Cotter was advised that he has been released from his employment agreement with the above parameter and that should he so request a Bureau Agent will be made available to him for consultation at the time of the interview. It was pointed out to Mr. Cotter that during the interview there are certain privileged areas concerning which he would not be required to answer questions, namely: information which might divulge the identities of FBI sources; information relating to sensitive methods and techniques; information which might adversely affect on-going FBI investigations and information which originated with other agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Cotter concluded by saying that upon being contacted by the SSC he would advise this Bureau of the date of the anticipated interview and his decision as to whether or not he would request that a Bureau Agent be made available for consultation.

Accordingly, if you have no objection, we will advise the Attorney General that you have reviewed the proposed procedures and will abide by his judgment, however, we continue to object to granting of access to raw files of the FBI to representatives of the SSC.

WASHINGTON, DIC 20530

July 21, 1975

TO: Edward H. Levi
Attorney General

FROM: K. William O'Connor
Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination

SUBJECT: Proposed Procedures - SSC

This draft of "Proposed Procedures" has not been discussed with SSC staff. It is intended to reflect the substance of the discussion had on 7/21, in your office; and incorporates (as underscored) additional language for the purposes suggested by that discussion. Also reflected are the slight editorial changes requested by the SSC in the draft attached to Senator Church's letter of July 18, 1975.

These procedures are designed to permit broad access for SSC staff to FBI materials at the FBI, or delivery of such materials, if appropriate, to the SSC. The present scope of the access is defined by the requests as received; those extant are the subject of superseding redraft under paragraph 1. The prospective scope of requested information is not restricted, but is subject to negotiation as indicated in the amendment to paragraph 1.

The proposed modification of paragraph 3 will be the focus of most controversy. The SSC will probably object to the withholding of sources under paragraph 3(d) (proposed) saying that access to information at the FBI offices is all that is required; that no note on such documents can be removed from the premises of the FBI under procedure 6; and that if they wish to pursue any sources, the appeal provision of existing paragraph 6 should cover it. Since that was the purpose of paragraph 6, and since paragraph 6(a) was designed to focus on any real problem which might arise, the scope of the stated problem under paragraph 3(d) may be seen by the SSC as an attempt to withhold information from the SSC staff, and delay the inquiry (since the Bureau would have to do considerable pre

delivery work under 3(d) to make properly defined and reviewed
deletions). Accordingly, I would expect SSC to assert (a) DOJ
does not trust SSC probity or security, and (b) DOJ is following
a dilatory and unnecessary tactic.

In anticipation of these problems, I have re-written
paragraph 9 to permit unilateral abrogation if the procedures
do not work. If actual information withheld is capriciously
defined, or if any lapse of good judgment occurs, I would expect
prompt abrogation by SSC and a very severe criticism of the
Director, the Attorney General, and the Department.

I think that is a high risk, and assumption of it places
a very heavy burden upon the Bureau, initially, and upon the
Department, ultimately.

My recommendation is that the proposed procedures be
attempted as redrafted, subject to Attorney General and White
House approval; but a vigorous caveat is indicated as to the
need for real restraint in the exercise of initial FBI discretion
under paragraph 3(d).

PROPOSED PROCEDURES

(1) The Domestic Task Force Leader[^1] will submit periodically a list of specific materials, relevant to the inquiry being conducted under S.R. 21, to which the Committee staff wishes access or of which the Committee desires delivery. Any questions as to the scope or meaning of any portion of such list shall be identified by the Special Counsel and discussed at the time of acceptance of the list, between the DIFL and the Special Counsel.

The first such list will be delivered to the Department of Justice within 48 hours of the adoption of this procedure, and will summarize and supersede all the presently outstanding requests; this list will be in priority order, as fixed by the Committee, with fixed delivery/access dates specified. Those materials for which the Committee requests delivery or access shall be delivered to the Committee or made accessible in Room 4171 of the Hoover Building not later than within 48 96 hours of the date specified. The Committee Chairman and Vice Chairman shall be informed by the Attorney General, within 24 hours of receipt of the request, of any delay beyond 48 96 hours, the expected length of the delay, and the specific reasons for the delay. Partial access or delivery shall be proffered, by the Bureau of/to any materials requested, while the balance of such materials are being prepared. A partial proffer shall not extend the time of full response set forth herein.

[^1]: Wherever used herein, the term Domestic Task Force Leader (DTFL) is understood to include the Chief Counsel and the Minority Counsel of the Senate Select Committee.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 143

- 2 -

The Attorney General may exempt specific topical areas of inquiry from the scope of these procedures. Such topical areas shall be identified by the Attorney General to the Chairman and Vice Chairman by letter upon consideration of the lists submitted pursuant to this provision. As to any such exemption, the procedure to be followed shall be proposed, defined, adopted, and followed after consideration by the SSC of the specific exemption, and pertinent inquiry and discussion at the staff level.

(2) The following procedures shall apply (a) where delivery of materials requested might jeopardize FBI sensitive sources or ongoing operations, or (b) where the Domestic Task Force Leader requests access to materials, rather than delivery to the SSC.

(3) The Department will furnish access at the Hoover Building in Room 4171 to those materials requested:

(a) only to the members of the Committee, where it is determined by the Attorney General that the materials involve peculiarly sensitive foreign intelligence sources *or sensitive* ongoing operations.

(b) In all other cases, to the appropriately cleared staff who will have access to all of the materials.

(c) An exception to (a) and (b) above is made for the identities of so-called "live" informants or potential informants as defined in the FBI Manual of Instructions as to which no access will be furnished

unless the identity of the individual as an informant or potential informant has already been made known to the Committee, or unless the Attorney General, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, jointly agree on the limited disclosure of such identities to the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

(d) An exception to (a) and (b) above is made for information which would identify persons, as sources, who have provided or continue to provide information to the FBI, and as to whose identity the FBI has undertaken an obligation of confidentiality. In order to preserve that obligation of confidentiality, the FBI will withhold access to this class of information, unless the identity of the individual as a source has already been made known to the Committee, or unless the Attorney General, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, jointly agree on the limited disclosure of such identities to the Chairman and Vice Chairman.

(4) Those materials to which the staff has access may be reviewed and studied in Room 41.71 of the Hoover Building and such notes may be taken as deemed appropriate by the Staff.

(5) The Committee staff shall select from these materials to which access is herein provided, those materials which it deems pertinent to the Committee's inquiries and necessary for delivery to the Committee's offices.

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI
SPECIAL AGENT (SA) JOHN M.-
MATTER BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

Set out below is information concerning an interview of former FBI SA John M. Matter by SSC Staff Members. Matter served in the FBI from October 21, 1940, until his retirement May 28, 1971. He is a current resident of Ft. Myers, Florida.

On advance notice from Mr. Michael Epstein, SSC Staff Member, Matter traveled to Washington, D. C., from his residence in Florida to be interviewed at 11:30 a.m. July 25, 1975, in the SSC offices.

Prior to appearing for the interview, Matter was informed by the FBI that he was being released from any applicable employment agreement for the purpose of the SSC interview which Epstein had indicated would concern the former FBI investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr. It was explained to Matter by the FBI that he had the right to counsel; however, the FBI was unable to provide private counsel. Matter was also told that there were certain privileged areas concerning which he would not be required to answer questions. These areas concerned sources; information relating to sensitive methods and techniques; information which might adversely affect ongoing FBI investigations; and information which originated

with other agencies, including foreign intelligence agencies. Matter was informed that if he desired the presence of an FBI representative for consultation purposes, one would be supplied on his request. It was explained that this representative would not be present at the interview itself, but would be located nearby and available for consultation purposes. Matter requested such assistance.

It was further explained to Matter by the FBI that if a question arose during the interview in one of the areas set out above, he had the privilege, before replying, of consulting with the FBI representative. The FBI representative accompanied Matter to the SSC offices and made himself available as indicated above.

Set forth below is a statement which Matter prepared and voluntarily furnished to the FBI which reports the results of the interview of him. Items underscored for emphasis or otherwise, and items placed in quotation marks are as indicated by Matter in his preparation of this statement. Only a minimal number of typographical and grammatical corrections were made by the FBI in the reproduction of Matter's statement.

Statement of John M. Matter

## STATEMENT OF JOHN M. MATTER

The following information is supplied as a result of an interview of former SA John M. Matter by SSC Staff Members Michael Epstein (asked about 95% of the questions) and Ms. Mary DeOreo (asked about 5% of the questions).
The information is presented according to subject matter and not in the chronological order in which it was asked because Epstein kept going back and picking up points that had been discussed previously.

The interview began at 11:35 a.m. on Friday July 25, 1975, and lasted until 5:40 p.m. with an hour out for lunch and three 10 minute breaks. It was held in a small, acoustically-treated room (former projection booth), up one flight of stairs above room G-308, Dirksen Senate Office Building. Epstein advised that this was an interview concerning the part I had in the Bureau investigation of Martin Luther King, Jr. (hereinafter MLK). He did not advise me of my rights until I called his attention to the lack of this about 5:00p.m., at which time he told me all information I gave was to be supplied voluntarily, that anything I said could be the subject of further investigation by his Staff and that I could decline to answer any questions which I did not feel were within the seope of the inquiry.

Epstein asked if I had discussed the MLK matter with any Bureau personnel this morning (July 25, 1975) - he sav me come to G-308 with the FBI representative who was available for consultation), and I stated I had discussed procedural matters with SAs Paul Daly and Seymor Phillips, both of whom had leaned ever backwards to limit my discussion to procedural matters and nothing else.

Epstein asked for and I supplied background information as to my present address, when I entered on duty in the Bureau, the field offices (FOS) where I had worked,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 152

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC
Statement of John M. Matter

when I was first assigned to the Radio Engineering Section (hereinafter Re SMC), and how long I was in that Section. He asked how I would describe my particular kind of work and I told him "security work' in the Security Unit in which I ultimately became Unit Chief. He inquired if I was assigned to other than the Re SEC and I advised that when I first reported on duty in the Laboratory in 1944, it was the Electrical Section, but that about two or three years later that Section was merged with the Re SEC. He asked and was told that the Chief of the Re EEC at the time was I. W. Conrad, who later became Assistant Director of the Laboratory.

After about 10 minutes, Epstein started to question me as to what Units existed in the Re SFC, what type of work was done in the Units and who was working with me in my Vait, explaining that he was trying to get an idea of how the Re SEC vas set up and where an investigation of MIK-type would fit into that Section. I asked for and was granted permission to see the FBI consultation reprezentative who accompanied me. When advised by me of this line of questioning, the representative told me to supply such information as to the ke BEC's set-up and the name of any Agents in my Unit. On returning to the interview, Epstein then produced an FBI organizational chart from the position of Director on down through the individual units in the sections under each division (this chart appeared to be ona issued after my retirement in May, 1971). He called my attention to the Re SRC and the Units listed thereunder, all of which dealt with radio matters except one which was listed as "Evidence Examinations." I advised him that my work fell into the latter and that all other units listed had to do with some phase of radio communications used throughout the Bureau. I furnished him at his request the following names of persons who had worked with me in "security matters" during 1960 to 1968, which he named as the peried in which he was interested:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 153

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC
Statement of John M. Matter

Wilbur G. Stevens, Robert A. Miller, William E. Harward,
and William D. Campbell. I stated that there may have been
others whese names I could not recall or who did not fit
into the time period he mentioned. He asked and I advised
that during that period, Richard L. Millen was Section Chief
and Arthur J. Baker was his Number One Man.

Epstein and DeOreo specifically named the following
persons and asked if they were connected in any way with the
MLK investigation: Pfafman, Mayo, Swartz, Bradley, Stevens,
and Berley. I advised that Robert F. Pfafman and George W.
Mayo had retired from the Re SEC about 1956 and 1958
respectively, Richard Swartz about 1968, Wayne Bradley about
1974, Wilbur C. Stevens was still in the Section, and
succeeded me as Unit Chief, that George Berley was in another
Section of the FBI Laboratory, and that to my personal
knowledge none of the above had been connected with the MIK
investigation. Epstein specifically asked whether "Don
Parsons" would have been involved and I told him I had no
knowledge of such. He asked if I knew Parsons and I said.
yes, he had been a former Assistant Director of the FBI
Laboratory.

Epstein and DeOreo questioned me at great length
as to how I got my assignment in the MLK investigation, whe
authorized the investigation, how long my work took, how
"the tapes" came into my possession, how I used "the tapes"
during my work, what I did with "the tapes" after I was
finished with my assignment, and whether anyone else worked
with me on the assignment (specifically asking me if I knew
"a William Campbell"). They also inquired what case supervisor
I dealt with in the Domestic Intelligence Division (hereinafter
DID). Some of these points were gone over by the
interrogators two or three times. I advised largely as follows
and qualified many of my answers as being "to the best of my
memory," and in some instances I could not recall specific
details or names:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 154

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC
Statement of John M. Matter

My assignment came orally from Section Chief Millen and quite possibly Assistant Director Conrad in a conference of the three of us in which I was advised that a Top Secret investigation of MLK had been authorized by the then Attorney General (AG) Robert F. Kennedy to determine if any attempt was being made by the Communist Party (CP) to infiltrate MLK's organization and use it to serve the Party's purposes. This particularly related to at least one highly-placed MLK staff member (whose name I do not recollect) who had been associated with CF activities in the past. I was told that I was to render all technical assistance that was required in keeping witli any requests made by then DID Assistant Director, William C. Sullivan, or DID case supervisor handling the investigation. Some tapes from the Au-authorized MLK installations would be received by me, and I was to prepare a composite tape of any derogatory information in those tapes. William Campbell of the Washington Field Office (WFO) was to work with me and was to be primarily responsible for preparing a transcript of the WFO tapes, while pinpointing for me any information that might be of value for the composite.

Campbell came to the Re SEC with the VFU tapes and he and I set up the necessary transcription and filtering equipment for him in the studio and control room parts of Room 7318 in the Justice Building (JB). At some point additional tapes were received from authorized MLK installations in

I would have determined these locations either from "identifica- tion on the tape reels or from "letters of transmittel," as such actually received with the tapes. I could not specifically recall whether any of the tapes were received directly by the Re SEC, from the last three Fos, but was of the opinion that they were most likely received from the DID case supervisor whose name I could not specifically recall. I was asked specifically if that case supervisor's name

was "Ryan," "Seymor Phillips," "Frank Baumgardner," or
"Lish. Whitson." I replied that I did not know a Ryan, and
that Phillips, Fred (not Frank) Baumgardner and Lish Whitson
were possibilities but I could not specifically recall whether
it was any one of them. Epstein hammered on "who was the
case supervisor," but I could give him nothing more definite
than I had indicated.

It took me somewhere between one and two weeks to
complete my part of the assignment. There were inquiries.
from both my Section Chief and the DID as to progress. There
were long hours put in by both Campbell and myself to do an
accurate and reliable job as well as possible. No one else
was assigned except us two because of the highly sensitive
nature of the material and its classification. I did not
specifically recall if "working copies" were made immediately
from the FO tapes, but most likely such was done since this
would eliminate the possibility of damaging the FO tapes during
transeription. At the same time I would have been able to
monitor the FO tapes to gain familiarity with the subject
matter and any sections which I might use for the composite
or were unintelligible. It is possible that Campbell may have
monitored the tapes with me at the same time with a second
set of earphones, but I could not specifically recall such.
I made the composite by copying the pertinent sections from the
FO tapes onto a single reel. The first part of the composite
would contain all the excerpts from one FO; the second part of
the composite, the excerpts from another FO; and so on through
the third and fourth parts. There possibly were gaps within,
the excerpts to indicate discontinuity and possibly longer
gaps between the end of all excerpts from one FO and the start
of excerpts from another FO.

To the best of my recollection, the final composite
did not contain splices between excerpts or between the FO
groups or excerpts. The composite was sterile (not traceable

to any source) as to the ¼ inch recording tape itself, the
7 inch plastic reel containing the tape, and the 7 inch box.
containing the reel. I do not recall whether it was a commercial
or a plain box. I estimate the total elapsed playing time of the
composite as being somewhere between 45 and 90 minutes, but
I could not recall the specific time nor the tape speed.

Epstein made quite a point of asking if the composite
had actually been put together as explained above, or whether
it was put together in the following manner: one or more
excerpts from one FO tape immediately followed by one or more
excerpts from another FO tape, and followed again by one or
more excerpts from a third or fourth FO tape. It appeared that
he was trying to indicate that the composite had deliberately
been put together in such a manner as to create a false impression
as to where the excerpts had come from. I stated that to the
best of my memory the composite had not been the target in that
manner and I categorically denied that any effort had been
made on my part to have the composite convey an idea other
than that which was actually on the tape. When the composite
was finished I made two or three copies of it which I identified
as "third generation tapes," while I considered the composite
a "second generation tape." I delivered the composite, most
likely in the government routing envelope, to William C.
Sullivan in the JB, fifth floor office of then Assistant to
the Director Alan Belmont. I recalled that this was on a
Saturday and Belmont was in his office with Sullivan.
Delivery was made to Sullivan as a result of instructions I.
had most likely obtained from Millen or Conrad who also told
me to inquire of Sullivan if there was anything else he wanted
me to do. I so inquired and Sullivan replied that there was
nothing further and that he would take it from there. I
could not recall if I delivered two or three copies of the
composite to Sullivan at the same time or wheter they were
sent to him or the DID case supervisor by special messenger
the following Monday. Nor could I specifically recall if I

gave a composite copy to Campbell so that he could make a transcription of it. However, that was a possibility because Campbell had the job of transcribing the WFO tapes and worked at it up to 6 weeks or two months.

To the best of my recollection, Campbell retained the WFO tapes and I have no way of knowing whether I used all WFO tapes or only those Campbell selected as being pertinent.[^1]

[^1]: Court Seal [JFK Law 10 a)-1]

I do not recall the specifics, but the tapes from were returned to the DID case supervisor either when I had furnished my part of the investigation or after Campbell completed his work. About two years after that, I got a telephone call from the DID case supervisor inquiring as to whether the Re SEC still had the tapes. I verified that he was the case supervisor and assured him the tapes had been sent to the DID after the Laboratory's work had been completed.

I have no specific knowledge as to what was to be done with the composite or the copies thereof. The preparation in the sterile form of tape, reel and box was apparently done as a result of a specific request made by William C. Sullivan.

I supposed that Bureau officials had their own reason for requesting such a composite, but I was never told.

Epstein kept pressing me with "didn't you think this was strange?" and finally "what was your opinion?" To the former I replied "not necessarily," and to the latter I said a possible reason could have been that Bureau officials wanted to give the composite to AG Robert F. Kennedy to show him the type of information being obtained so that he could decide whether the surveillances he had authorized were to be continued. I never discussed the "MLK tapes" with anyone in the Crime Records Division. I don't rule out the possibility that some member of that Division may have asked whether I had worked on the tapes, but I certainly had no discussion on the subject matter. I did not discuss the tapes with "Deke" DeLoach (specifically named by Epstein after he had asked me whether I had discussed the tapes with anyone in the Crime Records Division). Epstein asked if I had any knowledge of Ernie Belter having anything to do with the MLK installation - WFO, and I told him, "none."

He appeared to be trying to find some sort of record within the Bureau so that he could get names, dates and assignments. In answer to his inquiry, I stated that it was quite likely I had received an "assignment slip" to account for my time in the case. I seriously doubted that such a slip would bear the name of MLK but would most likely have identified it as a "special case" or the "MLK case." I had no knowledge of how Campbell's assignment was handled. A register is kept in the Re SEC for personnel signing in and out, but this would only show dates and times worked by me and other personnel, and would not indicate what I was doing during a particular day or 'period of time period." Campbell, being assigned to WFO, would have signed in and out on the WFO register, even though he was working for ailonger period of time in the Re SEC space.

# SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC
Statement of John M. Matter

I have no knowledge that a physical and/or photographic surveillance of MLK was conducted by the Bureau.

I received no "letter of commendation" or "meritorious raise" as a result of my work on the MLK ease. Nor was the latter specifically or otherwise mentioned in my last efficiency report. Epstein was very specific in asking about the letter of commendation, the meritorious raise and the efficiency report..

He asked if I was aware in any way that the tape had been furnished newsmen. I told him that I had a recollection of reading an article in a newspaper or weekly news magazine a few months or a year or more after my assignment that MLK tape information had been obtained by or furnished to newsmen. I wondered at the time how they had been able to get the information. I also pointed out that within the last year or two there have been a number of references by several featured news columnists that MLK tape information had been leaked to selected columnists. I again denied that at the time I delivered the composite to Sullivan that I had any specific knowledge of the use to which it was to be put.

Epstein and DeOreo did not ask if I had any further information to furnish to them which had not been brought out by questioning. It was very apparent that they did not wish to pursue the subject matter in a composite tape any further after I stated that

Nor did they pursue the interest of former AG Robert F. Kennedy in the case after his name was mentioned. Epstein wanted to know if it was apparent from the tapes that each

RE: INTERVIEW OF FORMER FBI SA BY SSC

Epstein gave me no explanation as to where he obtained the names that he specifically mentioned to me. It appeared to be his desire to conduct a thorough interview and to clear up confusion in his mind, possibly caused by conflicting reports about the tapes. He and DeOreo were courteous and stayed well within the legitimate bounds of the MLK investigation except as possibly indicated by his questions concerning the makeup of the Re SEC and its Units. While he did not state it specifically, as such, it appeared to me that he was trying to determine how tape recordings resulting from microphone surveillances were handled in a Section which dealt with radio matters. He seemed satisfied when I told him that the work of my Unit came under the "Evidence Examinations" Unit, He also accepted my explanation of "security work" with the comment that such sensitive work certainly was of a security nature. He made no effort whatsoever to inquire as to what further work I may have done in the Section. He specifically asked whether I had given any MLK information to Stevens, and I replied that while I could not recall specifically, this was possible because Stevens and. I worked closely together and he would have had to take over the case in my absence..

At a point near the end of the interview, Epstein asked me if I am a personal friend of William Sullivan, Seymor Phillips, Fred Baumgardner and Lish Whitson. I replied, "No." Epstein indicated doubt, to which I added that my relations with all were purely official. Epstein then asked if I held any animosity toward Sullivan. I answered, "No." He then inquired, "You don't have any?" Again I replied "No."

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

As indicated in the enclosure to the Committee's
July 9, 1975 letter to the Attorney General, we are still
awaiting several requested items which relate to the relation-
ship between the FBI and the CIA.

Although an FBI file search is presumably under-
way to locate all items which would be responsive to that
section of the Committee's request, we would appreciate
receiving as soon as possible, as a partial response, all
of the items bearing on this subject which were specifically
identified in the attachment to the Committee's May 14, 1975
request, as well as the exchange of correspondence between
'the FBI and the CIA which occurred on March 11 and 20, 1970,
and which related to domestic intelligence collection.[^1]

Finally, we would appreciate your advice concern-
ing the nature of "SCOPE" and Operation ORKID which are
identified in the above-referenced March 20, 1970 letter
from Director Helms to Director Hoover.

Your cooperation would be appreciated.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Thank you for your letter replying to our letter concerning access by certain members of the Select Committee to files and documents concerning them held by the Department, including the FBI.

The Committee has resolved to adopt a slightly different procedure than that proposed in your letter. As you know, the purpose of this particular request is to enable the members, through analysis of materials relating to them, to obtain general insights into how the Department of Justice, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, collects, maintains and retrieves for itself material on Americans generally. Accordingly, we suggest that at a mutually convenient time, the designated members come to the Department or the Bureau and physically go through the retrieval process with the persons who would be responsible for performing that function in a real life situation. The Committee members do not wish to have their individual files either removed from the filing system or "sanitized" prior to their reviewing them.

This proposed method of on-site review may help, moreover, to alleviate the possible problems of disclosure to the particular members which your letter adverted to. We are sure that you could discuss any remaining actual problems with the members themselves at your premises, including whatever retrieval problems may exist with respect to the letters from the members themselves which you referred to.

In the first instance, what the members seek is insight

The attached letter was forwarded to the Bureau by the Department.

RE: DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO THE

COMMITTEE'S PRIOR REQUESTS

RE: FURTHER DOCUMENTS PERTAILING TO

THE FBI AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

Reference is made to SSC letter dated May 14, 1975,
with attached appendices, requesting certain documents and
other information from the FBI.

Item number 5.e., Appendix A, of referenced
communication requests all memoranda of the FBI and the
Justice Department discussing the legal authority of the FBI
to use informants, including possible entrapment, provocation,
interference with lawyer - client relationship, or other
problems, to (1) investigate internal security matters,
(2) collect intelligence information, and (3) engage in
counterintelligence activity.

Items number 4.a. and 4.b. of Appendix B of referenced
communication requests, inter alia, with regard to 5.e. above,
all memoranda and other materials relating to the original
decision to use the technique as well as the policies and
procedures of the FBI for the utilization of the technique.

Enclosed with this memorandum is one memorandum responsive to the request in 5.e. above, regarding the legal authority of the FBI to use informants. This memorandum is captioned "Legal Authority of the FBI to Use Confidential Informants as an Investigative Technique," and dated July 24, 1973.

Also enclosed is a copy of SAC memorandum 23-75
dated May 27, 1975, which is believed responsive to 5.e. This
particular SAC memorandum is being provided herewith, since,
in view of its recent date, it was not included in the index
of SAC Letters and Memoranda previously made available to
the SSC Staff.

With regard to that portion of 5.e., above, concerning
"possible entrapment, provocation, interference with lawyer -
client relationship or other problems," as it relates to
informant operation, there are no Bureau memoranda or other
material addressing these areas, as the same policy and
procedures applicable to Special Agent conduct regarding these
problems similarly apply to informants. In response to your
general request under 4.b., above, FBI policy and procedures
concerning such matters are set forth in the Manual of
Instructions (MOI) and the Manual of Rules and Regulations (MRR),
which have already been made available to SSC Staff Members
pursuant to an earlier request and to the SAC Letters and
Memoranda which are being made available to SSC Staff personnel
for review pursuant to another request.

With respect to your request under Item 4.a., above,
no memoranda or other materials were located relating to the
original decision to utilize informants in our investigations.

It is noted your requests under Item 5., Appendix A,
of referenced communication were directed by you to both the
FBI and the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Our response
in this matter with respect to legal authority should therefore
be viewed in conjunction with any material you may have received
or will receive from the U. S. DOJ.

# UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

Memorandum

TO: Mr. Mintz

FROM: P. G. Donahue

DATE: 7/24/73

SUBJECT: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI
TO USE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS
AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

The legal authority of the FBI to use confidential
informants as an investigative technique rests upon three factors:

1) Legislative authority embodied in the approval of the annual appropriation.

2) Case law that the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments do not protect a wrongdoer from the use of informants.

3) Case law reflecting that courts recognize the necessity and utility of informants in providing probable cause for making arrests without a warrant, and for obtaining warrants, provided that certain conditions are met.

Regarding the first of the above-cited factors, reference is made to the "Hearings Before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, Departments of State, Justice and Commerce, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1974."

Part I, page 783 of those hearings, sets forth the justification language for the 1974 budget estimate for FBI salaries and expenses. It is noted that this language is the same as used'in '
previous years except for underlined and bracketed changes which do not affect this subject. There is specific provision under the

PGD:llr

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-
nation outside your Committee. Ise is limited to official proceedings by
your-Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person-
nel without the express approval of the FBI.

Re: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI TO USE CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMANTS AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

heading of "Salaries and Expenses" for "expenses necessary for the
detection and prosecution of crimes against the United States" and
more specifically for the "payment of rewards."

At page 879 of these hearings, there is set forth
as part of the testimony on "Investigative Accomplishments," a
paragraph detailing the statistics achieved by the use of confidential
informants. Since Congress has approved FBI appropriations without
objection to the use of money for "payment of rewards" or for the
informant achievements listed in the testimony, the approval of the
appropriations serves as one form of legislative approval for the
use of informants.

*   The use of informants does not violate the defendant's
    rights under the Fourth Amendment. Hoffa v. United States, 385
    U.S. 293 (1966).

"Neither this Court, nor any member of it has
ever expressed the view that the Fourth Amend-
ment protects a wrongdoer's misplaced belief
that a person to whom he voluntarily confides
his wrongdoing will not reveal it. Indeed, the
Court unanimously rejected that very contention
---in Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427---"

Id. at 302

The Court also held that the use of an informer did
not violate Hoffa's rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments,
citing United States v. Dennis, 183 F. 2d 201, 224, (1950), which
said,

"Courts have countenanced the use of informers
from time immemorial; in cases of conspiracy,
or in other cases when the crime consists of
preparing for another crime it is usually necessary
to rely upon them or upon accomplices because
the criminals will almost certainly proceed
covertly."

Memorandum.Donahue to Mr. Mintz
Re: LEGAL AUTHORITY OF THE FBI TO USE CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMANTS AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUE

Besides the explicit recognition reflected above of
the right of investigative bodies to avail themselves of informants,
there are other Supreme Court cases which implicitly recognize
this right by regulating the conditions under which an informant's
identity need be revealed at trial. (Roviaro v. United States,
353 U.S. 53 (1957)), or the conditions to be met in using an
informant's information as the basis of probable cause for an
arrest without a warrant. (Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307
(1959); McCray v. Illinois. 386 U.S. 300 (1967)). Similarly,
the Supreme Court has recognized that informant information may
form the basis for a warrant application, provided the affidavit
shows the underlying circumstances which would give reason to
believe the informant is credible, and circumstances showing
the basis for conclusions reached by the informant. (Aguilar v.
Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964)).

The above-cited cases show that while couris havo
circumscribed in several ways the uses to be made of informant
information, there has always been a recognition of the fact that
the informant is a basic and necessary weapon in law enforcement's
defense of society against crime.

MEMORANDUM 23-75

![handwritten notes on the page]

MEMORANDUM TO ALL SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE:

(A) INFORMANT MATTERS - DEFENSE PLANS AND STRATEGY -- Recently there have been several instances where attorneys in connection with law suits have publicly and erroneously alleged that the FBI utilized informants to uncover defense plans and strategy. Also, recently a former informant falsely alleged that informant's services were utilized by the Bureau to infiltrate a defense camp. These accusations reemphasize the need for the careful and professional handling of informants at all times.

As you are aware under current policy, informants are advised to avoid becoming involved in defense plans or strategy in subversive-type cases or with anyone under criminal indictment. It is the responsibility of all Special Agents handling informants to insure that their informants are continually alert so that they will avoid becoming involved in defense matters and in the event an informant is requested to assist or partake in such matters, that the contacting Agent is immediately advised so that the matter will be recorded. If the informant cannot avoid being involved, informant is not to report any information pertaining to defense plans or strategy and such incident must be promptly reported to the Bureau under the substantive case caption.

In view of the above, the statement of cooperation normally signed by security and extremist informants is being amended to incorporate current policy regarding defense plans and strategy. Where it is not required as in criminal informant cases or it has not been practical to obtain a statement of cooperation, each handling Agent must orally advise the informant of the above, reduce it to writing, and record it in the informant's file. Insure that all pending informant files reflect the above as a matter of record.

Manual changes follow.

MR. DE LOACH
MR. SULLIVAN

President Lyndon B. Johnson called and asked if I would check as they want him to be the Chief of the Army in the Dominican Republic, which would, in effect, control the city. The President stated he did not know his first name. I asked if he was in the Dominican Republic at the present time. The President stated he was; that they were getting pretty close to a settlement with and he thought we had checked him out, but anyway I had the whole list and he wants to be sure they are checked and that there are none who are known communists because, that is one thing both the right and left wings would attack him one, so the only way to protect him, the President, is to be sure they are not communists. The President stated another thing is how are they going to get rid of the communists when we do get a government. I stated that is going to depend on the strength of the one in power.

I told the President that in connection with who is going down to Puerto Rico with on the 5:00 PM plane, we have an Agent who is going on the same plane, but as to whether we can get a microphone in, we do not know because is living in a house rather than a hotel. I stated one of our Agents is driving to the airport in his car so he will have an opportunity to talk to The President asked if knew he was an Agent and I stated he does as he had interviewed but the Agent on the plane will not be known to I stated when arrives in Puerto Rico, a surveillance will be put on him but if he stays with as we anticipate, it will be difficult to cover except the telephones. I stated there are five lines operating between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and we have all five lines covered.

The President inquired as to whether they had asked me to assemble a staff to help on the anti-communist thing after the takeover and I stated the only names I have are of the Cabinet The President stated that after they get the

government in the alternatives are: Let them fight it out and kill thousands and probably the communists would end up in charge; we can go in there and try to get them to agree and go on the constitution and let them vote on it in 60 or 90 days, supervise the election and have a cabinet we mutually agreed upon which I can check upon; then once we get it, help the President with some intelligence people to point up who are communists. He said they ought to be Latins or ones who speak the language and he wanted me to take charge of that and to start right now saying if I were President, what I would do down there to get rid of the communists. The President stated it can't be done in one day, but that is what he wants for the Dominican Republic.

I told the President I had quite a number of Agents, a hundred or so, who are expert in the Spanish language so we have the facilities that we can do that. The President asked that I look at the best ones and see who it is; that it has to be a fellow who can get along with the new President whom he can trust, to figure out what I need, how I would set it up, and what I would do to get set up to go to work on the communists. I stated I thought it can be covered as we do in the South American countries as we have in some foreign countries a Legal Attache attached to the Embassy and if we have a man from the Bureau attached to the Embassy as Legal Attache, he can be the medium through which to advise the President and select the individuals who ought to be listed, deported, or put under control. The President asked I get the results of the check to him as soon as possible on

2:56 PM

While talking to the Attorney General on another matter, I advised him the President had just called and wanted a name checked, but also wanted me to pick a squad of FBI Agents to go to the Dominican Republic when the new government is formed to advise the President on the removal of communists and getting them out of government offices. I briefed the Attorney General on my conversation with the President. I told him I was not enthusiastic about it, but since he wants it dons, I was starting to look into it and trying to line up fifteen or twenty men able to do it. I told the Attorney General I had wanted him to know in the event the President speaks to him about it.

The President asked I be sure that I and Admiral Raborn, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, check out because he, the President, did not want to agree on a government and find a Khrushchev as the head of it. I stated I would check on the names he had given me Friday. I asked the President if Admiral Raborn had been furnished the list and he stated he was not sure but he wanted the two of us to check them out carefully.

## Memorandum

TO: MR. SULLIVAN DATE: 5/17/65

FROM: A. H. Belmont

SUBJECT: LEGAL ATTACHE'S OFFICE,
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

The Director advised that the President will want the FBI to set up a group in the Dominican Republic to advise the President of the Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them, and how to get rid of them. It is contemplated that we will set up a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Government and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate into the government. This activity would take place first in the city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Government has been advised.

All of the agents to be sent down should be fluent in Spanish and we should select any who have Dominican or Spanish blood, which will assist them in working inconspicuously with the populace.

Relative to the Legal Attache, he should be a top man, fully experienced, as he will be dealing with the President of the Dominican Republic and with our Ambassador there.

ACTION:

In anticipation of the above, the Director desires that we draw up suggestions for a Legal Attache and for a group of twenty to twenty-five men who can proceed, when so ordered, to the Dominican Republic for this purpose.

A copy of this memorandum is being designated for the Administrative Division so that the Domestic Intelligence Division and the Administrative Division can work together on this. Time is of the essence.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemination outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel without the express approval of the FBI.

LETTER NO. 65-31

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

June 2, 1965 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN AMERICA)-- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, who has already begun to make a valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed, current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin America threatened with communism.

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to assume in the intelligence field. To guarantee our complete success, teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the Dominican Republic.

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current) who are now in the Dominican Republic.

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of your office who appear to have good source potential.

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent) in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache, Santo Domingo.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemination outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel without the express approval of the FBI


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 201

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau, your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant development program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature, plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development program.

Very truly yours,

I called Admiral William F. Raborn, Director of CIA, and told him I wanted to pass on to him a development he may be asked about. I stated, about ten days ago, the President asked my view of the removal of my men from the Dominican Republic and whether the work we have been doing down there could be carried on by CIA as effectively as both agencies have handled it in the past.

I stated I checked with who is in charge of the FBI's office in the Dominican Republic, and he felt very strongly the FBI men could be withdrawn and the CIA personnel carry on. I advised Admiral Raborn that I sent this message to the White House and got word from Marvin Watson that the President indicated no move snould be made at this time and that our mon are still down there.

I advised Admiral Raborn that I expect to see the President this week and I am going to bring this up to see whether he will make a decision; that we could use those men back here; and that I think the situation is well in hand by CIA personnel. I said I thought the President. might make some inquiry of Admiral Raborn.

Admiral Raborn said he certainly appreciated my calling and he is delighted with the fine way our folks inve gotten along; that there is a lot of mutual respect. i stated that I instructed to let me know what his views were and did not tell him mine; that he was very high in praise of the man in charge of the CIA office, as well as the staff of this office.

I said we need them in this country where the riots are occurring; that this is not really our field; that it is CIA's field; and that the sooner we get back to our own field, the better.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON
MR. BELMONT
MR. DE LOACH
MR. SULLIVAN

President Lyndon B. Johnson called. He stated he was worried about the situation in the Dominican Republic and asked me how I felt about it. I told him it was my feeling that it is in an awful mess; that there have been several people who have been selected to be in the Cabinet who are far from being free of communist association or domination and why they were selected, I did not know, but I thought the situation down there is very critical. I stated I met with McGeorge Bundy and Admiral William Raborn of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) the other day as to whether the FBI could withdraw from the Dominican Republic and my view was that we could as CIA is thoroughly qualified and has a good man down there to carry on the responsibilities and there is no need for the FBI to remain. I stated it was the view of Admiral Kaborn and myself that it was going to be a mess and that we would have trouble for some time to come because various people are going back to the Dominican R. public now, such as and his followers, and the former Presidents who were deposed and I thought in the political campaign which is going to be held down there this year, there are going to be violent outbursts which are characteristic of the Latins. I stated the populace is very anti-American and now that has been sent out and made the rebel element, which is always strongly anti-American, will be in the ascendancy. I stated is not what one would call a strong man; that I think he means well and will try to do right but he is not the kind of a man who will stand up to his opposition.

The President stated he was not too happy with CIA and the reports he gets from them and he would hate to see the Bureau people pull out until a government is formed. I stated we wouldn't until he, the President, says so; that as I said the other day, we would not leave until the decision has been made by the President.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 205

September 10, 1965

Memorandum for Messrs. Tolson, Belmont, DeLoach, Sullivan

The President stated that while he thinks Admiral Kaborn is a wonderful man, this is playing for keeps and we can't have a Communist Government and we have to have somebody alert enough to stand up and say "this is suspicious," ct cetera. The President stated they tell him they have an Attorney General who is quite suspicious. I stated he is very dangerous to have in the Attorney General position. I stated in the discussion we had the other day in Mr. Sundy's office, one matter was how the investigative set-up would be under the new government and they were going to have a rising squadron of men working directly for the President of the Dominican Republic and then an intelligence unit which would gather information and a Dominican national police. I stated I expressed my opinion that I thought it was wrong for the President to have a flying squadron which would be nothing more or less than a secret police like Trujillo had who would make just reports the President would want against certain individuals who might not be as bad as the President felt they were. I stated I felt there should be an intelligence unit and that the national police should be increased. I stated we, of course, would assist in any training program they might want to set up either down there or up here. I stated at the present time in the national police is one man who was trained in our National Academy and was very valuable in furnishing us with information that we could not have gotten from other sources.

The President asked if we were having any trouble working together and I told him no trouble at all. The President stated he had asked me to be on the job to keep the communists from taking over this hemisphere and to serve him and he thought we ought to wait and not pull out of the Dominican Republic until the government has been selected and we get along further in this; for me to tell my man down there to root out everything he can and to be hard and tough as he can and be sure we get rid of every spy; that he did not know what the diplomatic people are doing to see that President Godoy takes our reports and respects them. I stated I understand the Attorney General was recommended by

I stated a large number of people are drifting back into the Dominican Republic from New York and Miami who have been exiled in the past and those who have been in political life in the past are going to run again.

# Memorandum

TO : Mr. W. C. Sullivan

DATE: August 22, 1966

FROM : Mr. W. R. Wannall

SUBJECT: OPERATIONS
LEGAL ATTACHE,
SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legal Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the President's desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic and that Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn informants over to the Agency.

In accordance with the desire of the President and recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special Assistant to the President, that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the White House that our staff in Santo Domingo would be reduced to three ren and that henceforth this office will be manned in a manner similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not be an operational office but rather will serve as a strategic listening post for intelligence data and as liaison with agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies of foreign governments in that country.

In light of this redirection of effort, we instructed Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to review his informant coverage to determine if any of our informants should be made available to the Agency for operation. Legal Attache has recommended that informants, be turned over to CIA. has been used principally to develop subversive data on individuals in Santiago, Dominican Republic. is a penetrative-type informant who has gained membership in Dominican subversive groups. Both of these sources are operational and are not the type we would contact in a normal liaison capacity. Continuation of their services under our current criteria would be a questionable procedure.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi- nation outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized person- nel without the express approval of the FBI.

Memorandum W. R. Wannall to W. C. Sullivan
Re: OPERATIONS
LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

In the case of this informant was originally developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested the New York Office might have use of informant's services. This information furnished to New York Office which replied that in the absense of organized activity informant would be of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity. This, of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS:

We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation to turn over to CIA is sound, even though both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable intelligence information to us. By making these informants available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplication or conflict. This matter should be discussed with appropriate officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.

ACTION:

If you approve:

Dear Mr. Rimestad:

![illegible annotation]

You have previously been advised of reductions in FBI personnel overseas which were made in response to the wishes of the President. In a further effort to comply with the desire of the President, I have decided to reduce our staff in Santo Domingo by one Special Agent and one clerk. This will eliminate one position in GS-14 and one position in GS-8.

You may be sure that I will continue to give this matter close scrutiny with a view to effecting further economies whenever such action can be taken without impairing the discharge of our responsibilities.

Sincerely yours,

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for-dissemination outside your Committee. Its use is limited to official proceedings by your Committee and the content may not be disclosed to unauthorized personnel without the express approval of the FBI.

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. TOLSON
MR. BELMONT
MR. DE LOACH
MR. SULLIVAN

President Lyndon B. Johnson called and asked if I would check one *Colonel a Communist* as they want him to be the Chief of the Army in which would, in effect, control the city. The President stated he did not know his first name. I asked if he was in the Dominican Republic at the present time. The President stated he was; that they were getting pretty close to a settlement with *Guzman* and he thought we had checked him out, but anyway I had the whole list and he wants to be sure they are checked and that there are none who are known communists because that is one thing both the right and left wings would attack him on, so the only way to protect him, the President, is to be sure they are not communists. The President stated another thing is how are they going to get rid of the communists when we do get a government. I stated that is going to depend on the strength of the one in power.

I told the President that in connection with *Jose Melchora*, who is going down to Puerto Rico with *Juan Roseo* on the 5:00 P.M. plane, we have an Agent who is going on the same plane, but as to whether we can get a microphone in, we do not know because he is living in a house rather than a hotel. I stated one of our Agents is driving *him* to the airport in his car so he will have an opportunity to talk to *Sumner*. The President asked *Fitzmaurice* knew he was an agent and I stated he does as he had interviewed *him*. But the Agent on the plane will not be known to *Fitzmaurice*. I stated when *Gilmar* arrives in Puerto Rico, a surveillance will be put on him but if he stays with *friends* as we anticipate, it will be difficult to cover except the telephones. I stated there are five lines operating between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and we have all five lines covered.

The President inquired as to whether they had asked me to assemble staff to help on the anti-communist thing after the takeover and I stated the only lines I have are of the *Cabinet*. The President stated that after they get the

Corandun for Messrs.. Toison, Belmont, De Loach, Sullivan

Government in the alternatives are: Let them fight it out and kill thousands and probably the communists would end up in enarge; we can go in there and try to get them to agree and go on the constitution and ict tham vote on it in 00 or 60 days, supervwe the election and have a cabinot we mutually agreed upon which I can check upon; then once we get it, holp the President with come inteligence people to point up who are communists. He said they ought to be Latins or ones who speak the language and he wanted me to take charge oi that and to start right now saying it I were President, what I would do down there to get rid of the communists. The President stated it can't be done in one day, but that is what he wants for the Dominican Repuolic.

I told the President I und quite a number of Agents, a hundred or so, who are expert in the spanish language so we have the facilities that we can do that. The President asked that I look at the best ones and see who it is; that it has to be a fellow who can get along with the new President whom he can trust, to figure ant what I need, how I would set it up, and what I would do to get set up to go to work on the communists. I stated I thought it can be covered as we do in the South American countries as we have in some foreign countries & Legal Attache attached to the Lisansy and if we have a man from the buivau attached to the Embassy ve Legal Atingho, he can be the medium through which to advice the President and select the individuals who ought to be listed, deported, or put under control. The President asked I get the results of the check to him as soon as possible on Coloneltora Lernences.

2:56 PM

While talking to the Attorney General.on another matter, L'advised him the President had just called and wanted a name checkcá, but also wanted me to pick a squad of FDI Agents to go to the Dominican Republic when the new government is formed to advise the President on the removal of communists and getting them out of government offices. I oricfed the Attorney General on my conversation with the President. I told him I was not enthusiastic about it, but since he wants it done, I was starting to look into it and trying to line up fifteen or twenty men able to do it. I told the Attorney General I had wanted hirs to know in the event the President speaks to him about it.

I also briefed the Attorney General in regard to Juan Balaguer and the coverage on that.

The President called and stated the name of the individual he had asked me to check is a graduate of the Canal Zone school and his complete name was *Eden Lora Fernandez*. I stated we can check that quickly.

The President asked I be sure that I and Admiral Raborn, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, check out because he, the President, did not want to agree on a government and find a Khrushchev as the head of it. I stated I would check on the names he had given me Friday. I asked the President if Admiral Raborn had been furnished the list and he stated he was not sure but he wanted the two of us to check them out carefully.

TO: MR. SULLIVAN DATE: 5/17/65

FROM: A. H. Belmont cc Mr. Belmont
Mr. Mohr
Mr. Sullivan
Mr. Wannall
Mr. D.J.Brennan

SUBJECT: LEGAL ATTACHE'S OFFICE, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.

The Director advised that the President will want the FBI to set up a group in the Dominican Republic to advise the President of the Dominican Republic concerning Communists, how to deal with them, and how to get rid of them. It is contemplated that we will set up a Legal Attache's Office, with a group of 20 to 25 men, for the purpose of taking charge of cleaning out communists in the Dominican Government and advising the government of those who may try to infiltrate into the government. This activity would take place first in the city of Santo Domingo, and then extend throughout the country until all communists have been spotted and the Dominican Government has been advised.

All of the agents to be sent down should be fluent in Spanish and we should select any who have Dominican or Spanish blood, which will assist them in working inconspicuously with the populace.

Relative to the Legal Attache, he should be a top man, fully experienced, as he will be dealing with the President of the Dominican Republic and with our Ambassador there.

ACTION:

In anticipation of the above, the Director desires that we draw up suggestions for a Legal Attache and for a group of twenty to twenty-five men who can proceed, when so ordered, to the Dominican Republic for this purpose.

A copy of this memorandum is being designated for the Administrative Division so that the Domestic Intelligence Division and the Administrative Division can work together on this. Time is of the essence.

# PERSONAL ATTENTION
LETTER NO. 65-31
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

June 2, 1965 WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535

(A) DOMINICAN SITUATION (NATIONALITY GROUP COVERAGE - LATIN AMERICA)-- For your information, Bureau has established a Legal Attache in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, who has already begun to make a valuable contribution to the over-all efforts of the United States in making certain that the Dominican Republic does not become another Cuba. If the United States succeeds in its efforts to keep communists out of the new Dominican coalition government which is in the process of being formed, current United States policy in the Dominican Republic could very well become the established course of action for all other countries in Latin America threatened with communism.

The responsibilities which have been placed upon the Bureau in developing intelligence data in the Dominican Republic, as well as in other Latin-American countries, are not only tremendous but may be the heaviest and most far-reaching burden the FBI has ever been asked to assume in the intelligence field. To guarantee our complete success, teamwork is a must.

Accordingly, first we must do everything possible to assist Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, in his immediate task of developing quality sources of sufficient quantity to effect maximum coverage in the Dominican Republic.

In this regard, each office and Legal Attache must furnish to the Bureau within five days of the receipt of this letter under the caption of "DOMSIT" (code word for "Dominican Situation") the following:

(1) Identities of any established sources (former or current) who are now in the Dominican Republic.

(2) Persons in Dominican Republic known to personnel of your office who appear to have good source potential.

(3) Identities of any current security sources (regardless of nationality) who may be available for assignment (temporary or permanent) in the Dominican Republic if such is considered feasible by Legal Attache, Santo Domingo.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 215

Any leads for purpose of checking background of potential sources for Santo Domingo must receive priority attention and results submitted by teletype.

In addition to the Dominican requirements placed upon the Bureau, your attention is directed to over-all need for additional informants and sources in the Latin-American field. The reputation the Bureau has gained during recent Dominican crisis is due in large part to the results achieved in developing Dominican sources through a concentrated informant development program over the past several years.

In view of critical state of unrest in Latin America today, each office should survey its informant coverage in this field. If substantial numbers of nationals of any Latin-American country reside within the territory covered by your office, Bureau expects that you will have coverage sufficient to alert you to exile organizational activities of political nature, plots to overthrow existing governments, and general intelligence data concerning the countries of interest. Informant development in this field is considered most important and any weaknesses which now exist must be overcome promptly by instituting an aggressive informant development program.

Very truly yours,

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE 11-15-00 BY SP-2 ALM

I called Admiral William F. Raborn, Director of CIA, and told him I wanted to pass on to him a development he may be asked about. I stated, about ten days ago, the President asked my view of the removal of my men irom the Dominican Republic and whether the work we have been doing down there could be carried on by CIA as effectively as both agencies have handled it in the past.

I stated I checked with (Anderson) who is in charge of the FBI's office in the Dominican Republic, and he felt very strongly the FBI men could be withdrawn and the CIA personnel carry on. I advised Admiral Raborn that I sent this message to the White House and got word from Marvin Watson that the President indicated no move should be made at this time and that our men are still down there.

I advised Admiral Raborn that I expect to see the President this week and I am going to bring this up to see whether he will make a decision; that we could use those men back here; and that. I think the situation is well in hand by CIA personnel. I said I thought the President might make some inquiry of Admiral Raborn.

Admiral Raborn said he certainly appreciated my calling and he is delighted with the fine way our folks have gotten along; that there is a lot of mutual respect. I stated that I instructed Anderson to let me know what his views were and did not tell him mine; that he was very high in praise of the man in charge of the CIA office, as well as the staif of this pifice. Admiral Raborn stated they welcome cooperation with the FBI any and every place.

I stated that I think we are going to have trouble down there but I think CIA can handle it with their force. He replied that they will be delighted to have us stay but they certainly appreciate the fact we may need our people elsewhere. I said we need them in this country where the riots are occurring; that this is not really our field; that it is CIA's field; and that the sooner we get back to our own field, the better.

I again stated it is very likely the President may speak to Admiral Rabora about this and he thanked me for calling.

MR. SULLIVAN

Santo Domingo

President Lyndon B. Johnson called. He stated he was worried about the situation in the Dominican Republic and asked me how I felt about it. I told him it was my feeling that it is in an awful mess; that there have been several people who have been selected to be in the Cabinet who are far from being free of communist association or domination and why they were selected, I did not know, but thought the situation down there is very critical. I stated I met with McGeorge Bundy and Admiral William Raborn of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) the other day as to whether the FBI could withdraw from the Dominican Republic and my view was that we could as CIA is thoroughly qualified and has a good man there to carry on the responsibilities and there is no need for the FBI to remain. I stated it was the view of Admiral Raborn and myself that it was going to be a mess and that we would have trouble for some time to come because various people are going back to the Dominican Republic now, such as Juan Bosch and his followers, and the former Presidents who were deposed and in the political campaign which is going to be held down there this year, there are going to be violent outbursts which are characteristic of the Latins. I stated the populace is very anti-American and now that General Wessin has been sent out and made Consul General at Miami the rebel element, which is always strongly anti-American, will be in the ascendancy. I stated President Godoy is not what one would call a strong man; that I think he means well and wishes to do right but he is not the kind of a man who will stand up to his opposition.

The President stated he was not too happy with CIA and the reports he gets from them and he would hate to see the Bureau people pull out until a government is formed. I stated we wouldn't until he, the President, says so; that as I said the other day, we would not leave until the decision has been made

Memorandum for Messrs. Tolsen, Belmont, DeLoach, Sullivan

The President stated that while he thinks Admiral Kaborn is a wonderful man, this is playing for keeps and we can't have a Communist Government and we have to have somebody alert enough to stand up and say "this is suspicious," et cetera. The President stated they tell him they have an Attorney General who is quite suspicious. I stated he is very dangerous to have in the Attorney General position. I stated in the discussion we had the other day in Mr. Bundy's office, one matter was how the investigative set-up would be under the new government and they were going to have a flying squadron of men working directly for the President of the Dominican Republic and then an intelligence unit which would gather information and a Dominican national police. I stated I expressed my opinion that I thought it was wrong for the President to have a flying squadron which would be nothing more or less than a secret police like Trujillo had who would make just reports the President would want against certain individuals who might not be as bad as the President felt they were. I stated I felt there should be an intelligence unit and that the national police should be increased. I stated we, of course, would assist in any training program they might want to set up either down there or up here. I stated at the present time in the national police is one man who was trained in our National Academy and was very valuable in furnishing us with information that we could not have gotten from other sources.

The President asked if we were having any trouble working together and I told him no trouble at all. The President stated he had asked me to be on the job to keep the communists from taking over this hemisphere and to serve him and he thought we ought to wait and not pull out of the Dominican Republic until the government has been selected and we get along further in this; for me to tell my man down there to root out everything he can and to be hard and tough as he can and be sure we get rid of every spy; that he did not know what the diplomatic people are doing to see that President Godoy takes our reports and respects them. I stated I understand the Attorney General was recommended by Sunkel and Bennett.

I stated a large number of people are drifting back into the Dominican Republic from New York and Miami who have been exiled in the past and those who have been in political life in the past are going to run again.

Memorandum

SUBJECT: OPERATIONS
LEGAL ATTACHE,
SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

1 - Mr. DeLoach

1 - Mr. Sullivan

1 - Liaison
(Mr. Papich)

1 - Foreign Liaison Unit (Mr. Potocki)

1 - Mr. Wannall

1 - Mr. Griffith

This is to recommend that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) be advised that we have set up a regular Legal Attache Office in Santo Domingo in view of the President's desire that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic and that Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, be authorized to turn two informants over to the Agency.

In accordance with the desire of the President and recommendation of the Honorable Marvin Watson, Special Assistant to the President, that the FBI remain in the Dominican Republic, the Director, on 8/2/66, advised the White House that our staff in Santo Domingo would be reduced to three men and that henceforth this office will be manned in a manner similar to that of our other Legal Attache Offices. It will not be an operational office but rather will serve as a strategic listening post for intelligence data and as liaison with agencies of the Dominican Republic, as well as other agencies of foreign governments in that country.

In light of this redirection of effort, we instructed Legal Attache, Santo Domingo, to review his informant coverage to determine if any of our informants should be made available to the Agency for operation. Legal Attache has recommended that two informants, DOM-10 and DOM-12 be turned over to CIA. DOM-10 has been used principally to develop subversive data on individuals in Santiago, Dominican Republic. DOM-12 is a penetrative-type informant who has gained membership in Dominican subversive groups. Both of these sources are operational and are not the type we would contact in a normal liaison capacity. Continuation of their services under our current criteria would be a questionable procedure.

Memorandum W. R. Wannall to W. C. Sullivan
Re: OPERATIONS
LEGAL ATTACHE, SANTO DOMINGO OFFICE

In the case of DOM-12, this informant was originally developed by the New York Office. Legal Attache suggested the New York Office might have use of informant's services. This information furnished to New York Office which replied that in the absense of organized activity informant would be of no use unless he came to New York with instructions from Dominican communist groups to reorganize activity. This, of course, is not a desirable situation.

OBSERVATIONS:

We believe Legal Attache, Santo Domingo's recommendation to turn-DOM-10 and DOM-12 over to CIA is sound, even though both of these sources are in a position to furnish valuable intelligence information to us. By making these informants available to the Agency we will avoid any possible duplication or conflict. This matter should be discussed with appropriate officials by our Liaison Agent in order to insure the Agency is fully aware of our current status in the Dominican Republic.

ACTION:

If you approve:

J. C. Farrington to Mr. McDermott Memo
REQUEST BY U.S. SENATOR WALTER F.
MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBER
TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES

In above file references, we had seven documents containing masked out portions. As these masks will be removed prior to replacing in our files, a Xerox of the pertinent portion of the respective documents have been made for record purposes and attached to this memorandum.

Concerning (105-188989-8) Department of State letter to FBI dated April 10, 1969, Senator Mondale advised he had recevied a copy of this letter from the State Department.

Concerning 62-110783-68 report of SAA Dale E. Berglund dated March 10, 1966, at Minneapolis captioned "MILES WELTON LORD; United States Attorney District of Minnesota, Administrative Inquiry - Bribery," Mr. Adams mentioned to Senator Mondale there were privacy considera- tions concerning this report and Senator Mondale limited his review of this document to information pertaining to himself set forth on pages 35b and 36.

ACTION: For Information.

ADDENDUM: J. B. ADAMS:ams 7/31/75

Subsequent to the meeting, David Aaron advised that the Senator requested to be advised as to why certain serials of sensitive coverage (technical coverage on foreign embassies) seemed to end in 1970 and I advised him that in recent years our indexing procedures in such matters have not called for indexing the name of a Congressman or

it has not been indexed for - 4 - retrievability.

Memorandum for Mr. McDermott
Re: REQUEST BY U. S. SENATOR WALTER F.
MONDALE, SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
MEMBER, TO REVIEW HIS FBI FILES

The Senator raised a question concerning a folder on the
Consumers Advisory Council, of which he was a member (62-108230-1)
and inquired how we came into possession of this particular report. I
determined that this report had been sent to Mr. Hoover in September,
1962, by Richard Berlin, President of the Hearst Corporation, as he
felt Mr. Hoover would be interested in reading the report. I advised
Mr. Aaron that the report had been sent to Mr. Hoover by a friend of
his in the newspaper field.

ReWFOlet dated 7/22/65, in captioned matter.

Dept advised SA DONALD A. BRUMMITT of the following developments in connection with subject's status since EMOND was interviewed on 7/19/65.(5-1)(8)(v)

Prior to departing for the USSR, BATOREWICZ was advanced $1,000 for travel and living expenses. Upon her return she was asked to repay this money. She was unable to do so since she had spent the money during her travel in Europe. Upon being advised that the funds must be repaid, she became quite upset and pointed out that she has been put to considerable inconvenience. (5-1) (8) (v)

On 7/21/65, Mr. EMOND learned that BATOREWICZ.had contacted Congressman JOSEPH KARTH and Senator WALTER MONDALE, both of Minnesota and related the full facts of her employment with USIA and subsequent abrupt recall from the Soviet Union along with comments on her being expected to repay the $1,000 advance in funds. (5-1) (8) (v)

As related by Mr. EMOND, Congressman KARTH and Senator MONDALE have both contacted USIA and requested all details. He said it looks as if there will be a "considerable stink" about the matter. (5-1)(8)(v)

Mr. EMOND said there has been no mention made of any FBI interest in BATOREWICZ. (5-1)(8)(v)

Reference is made to your memorandum July 16, 1975, captioned as above, requesting information relating to the collection, analysis, use, and dissemination of organized crime intelligence and a second request related to what extent have communications between the White House and the FBI or other agencies under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General bypassed the Attorney General and to what extent should such communications be channeled through the Attorney General.

In response to the first matter, on June 25, 1974, I testified before the FBI Oversight Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Bureau has "no statutory authority to collect intelligence per se" but that it operates under the general umbrella of 28 U.S.C. 533 (3), which authorizes the Attorney General to appoint officials "to conduct...investigations regarding official matters...as may be directed by the Attorney General," A listing of any directives issued by the Department or the Attorney General with respect to organized crime should be available in the office of the Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, Department of Justice.

EX:107 REC-1 62-116515-510

With respect to the FBI, all our investigations in the organized crime field are aimed at one ultimate objective: prosecution.

During the course of our investigation of individual hoodlums and the various criminal syndicates operating through-out the United States, we naturally acquire considerable data regarding the structure of the organized underworld, the identities of its principal leaders, the extent of its influence, its primary sources of income, its payoffs to corrupt officials, and the operations of its vast communications networks.

# The Attorney General

Most of this information is obtained from paid informants, from other law enforcement officers, from alert citizens, and from court-approved electronic surveillances installed under the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.

None of it, however, is intelligence for intelligence's sako. The experionco of the FBI over the years has shown that criminal syndicates exist for the sole purpose of conducting illegal operations and that anyone belonging to them may reasonably be presumed to be engaged in one or more of these activities. Therefore, our investigations of the organized underworld are not aimed at developing gencral nonspecific data but at establishing which criminal violations its members are engaged in and then proving these violations in a court of law.

Obviously, not every case opened, overy lead followed, or overy bit of information received is going to wind up in Federal court. On the contrary, much of this material relatos to offenses outside the investigative jurisáiction of the FBI. When such is the case, we immediately discominate the information to the appropriate Federal, state, or local agency. As a result, information uncovered by the FBI during the past five years alone has enabled the recipient agencies to make more than 17,000 organized crime arrests; confiscate over 151,000,000 worth of illicit drugs and narcotics, 9,000,000 worth of cash, property, weapons, and wagering paraphernalia, and 6,000,000 worth of counterfeit bills; and assess tax liens against 19,000,000 worth of property arising out of Federal gambling cases.

In addition, a considerable portion of the organized crime intelligence information dovelopea by the FBI is for-warded to the various Feacral Strike Forces coordinating racket investigations throughout the country and to the Criminal Division of the Department, which has entered this information in its computerized data bank called "Racketeer Profile."

# The Attorney General

In response to the second request in your letter, my answer is restricted to communications between the White House and the FBI as it would not be appropriate for me to attempt to respond for other agencies under your jurisdiction.

There are two major areas in which the Attorney General does not sce communications between the White House and the FBI. They are the results of name checks and the results of full field investigationswe do for the White House. The White House requests approximately 13,000 name checks per year concerning persons who visit the White House complex who could pose a physical threat or possible embarrassment to the President directly or indirectly. Approximately 1,000 full field background investigations on Presidential appointeos, nembers of the White House staff, and other persons having regular access to the White House are requested annually.

I direct your attention to Section 0.15 (b) (7), Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, which states that the Deputy Attorney General shall "Coordinate Departmental liaison with the White House staff and the Executive Office of the President." When this order was promulgated there were discussions botween the Department and Bureau officials as to its implementation and its impact on existing direct liaison between the FBI and the White House. Ly letter to the Attorney General, May 2, 1974, captioned "Revision of the Department of Justice Organization Regulations (28 CFR Fart 0)," set forth the FBI's need for a Special Agent-Liaison officer to handle day to day opcrational liaison with the White House. His activities were outlined and it was requested that he continue to handle operational problems on a daily basis with specific individuals because of the sonsitivity of the matters involved, both of a personal security and intelligence nature.

By memorandum dated May 16, 1974, captioned "Direct Operational Liaison with the White House," the Attorney General authorized the continuance of FBI direct operational liaison with the White House.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 253

# The Attorney General

With the exceptions as noted above, the FBI has adhered to a policy that when information is given to the White House the Attorney General is given the same information contemporaneously. Most of this information relates to current matters pertaining to the national security. This dissemination to the White House is sometimes based on requests from the White House but more frequently on the initiative of the FBI.

With regard to any correspondence directed to this Bureau from the White House, short of a file by file review, there is no means of determining whether or not such communications bypassed the Attorney General.

The established rule of furnishing the Attorney General copies of correspondence to the White House should be followed strictly so that the Attorney General is kept fully informed on matters of interest to him.

By memorandum dated 4/23/75, you were advised that former Intelligence Division Supervisor (Lish Whitson) reported to the writer that he had been interviewed by Mike Epstein of the Senate Select Committee Staff regarding the Martin Luther King case. Whitson had participated in activity at the direction of former Assistant to the Director, William C. Sullivan, relating to the mailing of a package from Florida to King's office. The package had been delivered to Whitson at National Airport on a Saturday by someone unknown to Whitson.

At 5:30 p.m., today, Whitson telephoned the writer to state that he had been contacted by phone just a few minutes before by Mike Epstein. He said that the latter asked him, Whitson, if the person who had met him at National Airport and turned the package over to him was either "Doc" Miller (Fred M. Miller) or John Matter. Whitson said he told Epstein that it was neither of these two former FBI Laboratory employees.

ACTION:

To record information furnished voluntarily by former Supervisor Whitson.

On 7-18-75 Michael Epstein, staff member of the Senate Select Committee, advised that he desires to interview the following Agents: Donald P. Burgess, Robert W. Thomson, O. Richard Hamilton, Charles T. Haynes and Alden F. Miller, all of the Atlanta Office. Additionally, he requested that SA W. John Benton of the Knoxville Office be made available in Atlanta. All interviews will be conducted on Tuesday, 7-22-75. The scope of the interviews will be the Bureau investigation of Martin Luther King. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the Department, advised Assistant Director John A. Mintz on 7-18-75 that staff interviews would no longer be considered a demand and thus no longer necessitate a waiver of the Code of Federal Regulations provisions concerning interviews.

After securing the approval of Robert H. Cahill of the Administrative Division for the travel of Benton to Atlanta, SAC Harold C. Swanson, Knoxville Office, was telephonically advised on 7-18-75 to arrange that Benton be available in Atlanta, 7-22-75.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That existing employment agreements of the aforementioned Special Agents be waived for purposes of this interview.

(2) That a representative of the Intelligence Division travel to Atlanta to be available for consultation for the interview.

Memorandum

TO : Mr. J. B. Adams

DATE: 7-10-75

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

Attached is a copy of a Departmental memorandum which interprets "demand" under 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21 et seq. for the purpose of dealing with the Senate Select Committee. The provisions of 16 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21 et seq. requires Departmental approval in those instances where a current or former employee in response to a demand of a court or authority is required to furnish material contained in Departmental files or disclose information contained therein.

The Department decision as set forth in the attachment characterizes all requests by Senate Select Committee staff members as a demand which requires a waiver from the Department prior to the employee's submission to the Committee request.

According to the Departmental position concerning demand, the Director or "the FBI General Counsel" in coordination with the Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination of the Department may waive the provision of 28 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.21 et seq. This is in accordance with the provision of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 16.23.

Upon receipt of the attached documents, SA Paul V. Daly and Inspector John B. Hotis of this Division sought clarification concerning the Departmental interpretation of "demand" as set forth in attachment, including whether this interpretation applied to the General Accounting Office (GAO) inquiry into the Bureau. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, stated he believed this might also apply to GAO, however, he had not really thought out this point. He was also asked what was meant by the phrase, "in coordination with this office." Mr. O'Connor indicated that he wanted to be notified of requests for interviews and that was what he meant by the phrase, "in coordination with this office."

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75

He was advised by SA Daly that we had previously received requests for the interview of a number of employees in Atlanta, Georgia, by the Committee and that upon receipt of the attached communication, after consultation with Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination Michael Shaheen, SA Daly had telephonically informed John Elliff, head of the domestic intelligence task force for the Committee, of the Department's interpretation as set forth in the attached document and the fact that Mr. Elliff should contact Mr. O'Connor concerning these proposed interviews. Mr. O'Connor said that he had been contacted by Mr. Elliff and had, in fact, told Mr. Elliff there would be no interviews. In this regard, O'Connor stated the Department had prepared a proposed draft letter to the Committee expressing concern for the Fifth Amendment rights for Bureau employees and raising other legal issues. Mr. O'Connor indicated that the finalized form of this letter should be sent to the Committee in the near future.

The results of the conversation with John Elliff by O'Connor have caused the Office of Legal Analysis to receive complaints concerning this decision from various Committee staff members, including Mark Gitenstein and Michael Epstein. We can anticipate, unless this particular problem is resolved, receiving protests from their superiors on the Committee.

RECOMMENDATION:

You will be kept advised of developments concerning this matter. Legal Analysis Office will continue efforts to determine what effect this will have on the GAO inquiry.

Deputy Attorney General

FROM: K. William O'Connor
Special Counsel for
Intelligence Coordination

SUBJECT: Interpretation of "Demand",
28 C.F.R., § 16.21, et. seq. - Action Memorandum

The meaning of "demand" is not indicated, beyond subpoena, in the C.F.R. sections indicated. This omission creates a need for an interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the White House and the Senate Select Committee on June 13, 1975, and a copy of those procedures was furnished to the Department on June 16, 1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the Committee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time before the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in the guidelines. The Committee is required to provide the witness with a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". The Committee is required to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) subject area; (b) periods of employment; (c) the date set for the interview.

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., § 16.21, et. seq., which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request by any Committee staff member to interview any employee, former employee or other person connected with the Department of Justice.

This interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the witness be authorized to speak under § 16.23 by an appropriate Department Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designated. I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI should be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, in coordination with this office.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 265

As a matter of current practice, the FBI and other components of the Department are presently coordinating with me on agreements for disclosure under § 16.23, as a system for ensuring that they are receiving treatment consistent with the outlines of inquiry procedure and the agreements between the Committee and the Department.

If you approve, I will advise the involved components of the Department of Justice that the word "demand" will be interpreted as indicated for each witness.

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

On July 23, 1975, Mike Gitenstein., staff member Senate Select Committee, requested that he be given a briefing concerning "Official and_Confidential" files. By way of background, we furnished a summary of the inspection inquiry to the Committee by letterhead memorandum dated 7-16-75, and also made available for review in Bureau space a list of people contacted during the course of this inquiry.

With regard to Gitenstein's request it would appear beneficial for us to brief the Senate Select Committee representative concerning the scope and details of this inquiry. In this regard it appears Gitenstein is interested in those individuals who were contacted by the Inspection Division during their inspection into the "Official and Confidential" files.

If approved the briefing will be tentatively scheduled for Friday, July 25, 1975.

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

By memorandum dated June 24, 1975, you were advised of the Department's intention to make a closed Departmental file available to captioned Committee. The file contained the results of a criminal investigation conducted by the Bureau. The Intelligence, General Investigative and Special Investigative Divisions were requested to furnish their views concerning this matter and the Legal Counsel Division was to prepare a letter to the Department setting forth the Bureau's position with regard to this matter.

We have since had discussions with the Attorney General and other representatives of the Department concerning Senate Select Committee access to Bureau files and submitted correspondence to the Department concerning this matter. It would appear additional communications to the Department are unnecessary. The Department is well aware of our position in this matter.

We do not prepare a communication to the Department concerning this matter.

# UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Los Angeles, California
August 7, 1975

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES (SSC); INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT
DIRECTOR IN CHARGE ROBERT E. GEBHARDT BY
SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 7, 1975, Assistant Director Robert E.
Gebhardt, Los Angeles Division, was interviewed in the Los
Angeles FBI Office by Mr. Lester Seidel, Staff Member of
the Senate Select Committee, United States Senate.

Gebhardt's rights were not explained to him by
Seidel although Seidel did explain the purpose of the
interview, that is, the *Cointel Program* of the FBI as it
related to the FBI's investigation of the Black Panther Party
when Gebhardt was the Special Agent in Charge of the San
Francisco Division from 1970 to 1972.

The interview lasted from 9:05 AM until 10:30 AM,
and it was not necessary for Gebhardt to consult with any
Bureau representative.

Gebhardt had previously been advised by a Bureau
representative of his right to counsel, the privileged areas
of information, consultation privileges, and the parameters
of interview.

Seidel inquired at the outset as to whether Gebhardt
was aware of the Cointel Program relative to the Black Panther
Party investigation on a day-to-day basis being specifically
advised details of the investigation as it relates to the
Cointel Program. It was explained to Seidel that as Special
Agent in Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office wherein
over 500 employees were located at the time, Gebhardt had
many responsibilities in the operation of that division and

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 270

therefore, relied upon the experience, expertise, and judgment
of the various supervisors assigned to the office for the
day-to-day direction of the various matters under investigation,
including the investigation of the Black Panther Party.

It was further explained that if a problem was
encountered or a particularly unusual situation developed,
Gebhardt was, of course, consulted and was available for
such consultation to resolve any particular problem areas.

Gebhardt was next asked if he recalled being SAC
when the electronic coverage of the Black Panther Party and
the various officials at BBP was instituted and eventually
terminated. Seidel was advised that the electronic coverage
was already in effect upon Gebhardt's arrival, however, he
does recall receiving a phone call after the "Keith Decision"
was handed down instructing that all electronic coverage of
the BPP and the various members of the BPP be discontinued.
The call was received from Bureau Headquarters and the
discontinuance was effected immediately.

Seidel inquired as to whether Gebhardt felt the
intelligence type investigations should be completely removed
from the criminal investigations which investigations would be
looking toward eventual prosecution.

Seidel was informed by Gebhardt that even in criminal
investigations looking toward prosecutions, much intelligence
information is obtained from time to time which really has no
value from a prosecutive standpoint, but does have possible
value with respect to the direction of the investigation. In
some criminal investigations a great deal of intelligence
information may be obtained and in other types, very little.
Insofar as the FBI is concerned, however, every effort is
made to make certain there is some Federal law which would be
a basis for an investigation which procedures would include
matters commonly referred to as security investigations.

In some instances, in such security investigations
a great deal of intelligence information would be obtained
therefore, it was Gebhardt's opinion that so-called intelli-
gence type investigations should not be removed from or
differentiated from criminal type investigations looking
toward prosecutions since intelligence information is an
outgrowth of the basic investigation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 271

Gebhardt was asked if he felt the Cointelpro was a separate entity distinguished from the basic investigation and it was explained that the Cointelpro was a phase of the overall investigation in any particular organization or individual.

Gebhardt was asked if he felt Congress should enact legislation which would set forth specific investigative techniques that could or could not be utilized by the FBI or other Federal investigative agencies. He was advised in Gebhardt's opinion, such legislation should not be enacted, and in reply to the question as to why such legislation should not be enacted, it was pointed out that as an investigative agency, there must of necessity be allowed a certain flexibility because no two investigations are exactly alike and the circumstances of such investigations could possibly not be related to such Federal law.

In answer to the question as to how Congress should assure the American public that questionable activity such as the Cointelpro, was not being engaged in by an investigative agency such as the FBI, Seidel was informed that the Congress and the American people must rely upon the integrity and honesty of the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General.

It was pointed out that both the Director of the FBI and the Attorney General are nominated by the President, hearings are held before the various Congressional Committees and finally approved by the Senate. It was further pointed out that Director Kelley has recently stated in connection with the publicity relative to Cointelpro, that he has no intention of permitting this program to be reinstituted in the FBI and if circumstances ever arose which circumstances he could not contemplated at this time, wherein it was thought such activities should be embarked upon, he would obtain the personal approval of the Attorney General prior to such instituting. Seidel was informed that Gebhardt was in total agreement with this statement of Mr. Kelley.

Gebhardt was asked as to what his feelings were relative to what the relationship should be between the FBI and Congress. He was informed that a Senate Oversight Committee was recently established and it was felt that this was a good start and that this Committee should formalize and

- 3 -

NW 88326 Docld:32989627 Page 271


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 272

standardize their oversight responsibilities and make regular inquiries of the Director and other officials of the FBI as to our activities. He was informed that there should be either a joint oversight committee between the House and Senate or if the Congress decided on two oversight Committees in both the House and Senate, these committees should be the entities through which all information relative to the activities of the FBI should flow.

It was emphasized however, that there should be regular consultation between these representatives and the FBI.

Inquiry was made as to Gebhardt's opinion relative to the relationship between the Department of Justice and the FBI and Seidel was informed the relationship, in Gebhardt's opinion, is excellent, should continue, and there should be a free flow of information between the FBI and the Department of Justice.

At the conclusion of the interview, Gebhardt summed up his comments by stating that Congress should definitely set up a structured oversight procedure of the activities of the FBI with due regard to the confidentiality of many of the FBI operations and investigations and must assure itself that the members of the Committee and its staff will maintain the confidentiality where necessary.

Secondly, in the areas of investigative matters usually referred to as national defense, national security or intelligence operations, all of the FBI investigations must be based on the application of the facts toward a particular Federal statute and if the facts are so oblique that they cannot be clearly applied to a particular Federal statute, consultation with the Department of Justice should be had in all instances.

# Memorandum

TO : Mr. Adams

FROM : Legal Counsel

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

DATE: 6-18-75

At 10 a.m., on 6-18-75, Mr. William Miller, Staff Director Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities called Inspector John B. Hotis to advise that he heard a report on the radio earlier that morning concerning the alleged penetration of Congressional and Senatorial offices by the KGB or agents of Soviet bloc Nations. Miller said he did not have any further details and stated he was uncertain whether the report alleged actual penetration of the offices or simply increased contacts by the Soviets with Members of Congress. Miller said he believed the source of the report was a television interview of Senator Goldwater (R-Arizona) on Sunday, 6-15-75.

Mr. Miller said the members of the Senate Committee were concerned about these allegations and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to inquire into the matter. Assistant Director Wannall has been advised of this request.

RECOMMENDATION:

In view of the sensitivity of this matter, it is recommended that the Intelligence Division prepare an oral briefing for Mr. Miller concerning increased Soviet contacts with Members of Congress.

The following information is set forth to advise you of pertinent developments subsequent to my memorandum of 8/1/75.

At approximately 3:00 p.m., 8/5/75, Mr. Executive Assistant to the Deputy Associate Director, advised Special Agent (SA) Thomas J.

FROM : W. O. Gregar

SUBJECT: SENSTUDY 75

PURPOSE:

To advise of receipt of uncorroborated information from Philadelphia Office to the effect that a Staff Member of the Church Committee reportedly, without authorization, Xeroxed a CIA document in possession of the Committee for subsequent transmittal to Congressman Morris Udall.

DETAILS:

Senstudy is acronym for Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (SSC), also known as Church Committee, which Committee is looking into operations of members of the intelligence community.

By teletype 7/30/75, our Philadelphia Office advised that one Robert Thweat, a retired United States Navy Commander, had made available information he received from an unnamed relative. This relative told him that one Daniel O'Flaherty, who is employed with the Church Committee, had on an unknown date removed from his work area, by hiding underneath his shirt, a CIA memorandum containing derogatory information on Senator Henry Jackson O'Flaherty then Xeroxed the memorandum and provided the Xeroxed copy to an unknown person for subsequent transmittal to Congressman Morris Udall. According to Thweat O'Flaherty had personally related the above information to his relative and reportedly had also related the incident to a Mr. Katz, a former associate who is currently a professor at the University of Vanderbilt, Nashville, Tennessee. Katz

reportedly voiced his displeasure to O'Flaherty stating he did not approve of the latter's action. The memorandum in question dealt with CIA's possible use of derogatory information to determine the direction Senator Jackson would take in future actions he might encounter which might involve CIA activity Thweat advised he would recontact his relative to determine if this individual would come forward, reveal his identity and be cooperative in any investigation.

A memorandum from CIA dated 7/29/75 indicates that James Daniel O'Flaherty, born 11/4/42, is a member of the Staff of SSC and has been granted a security clearance up to "Top Secret"

On the morning of 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office was telephonically contacted and instructed to expedite a contact with Thweat to determine the availability of his relative. At approximately 2:30 p.m., 7/31/75, Philadelphia Office advised that Thweat, upon recontact, had stated that it would be impossible to contact his relative before this coming weekend. In conversation, he identified his relative as a niece who is currently attending school in Washington, D. C. He further advised that O'Flaherty reportedly is no longer residing with his wife and is engaged in an emotional relationship with his niece. Thweat added he believed his niece would be cooperative as she has expressed her disapproval of O'Flaherty's action. He concluded by saying that upon determination of his niece's decision in this regard he would immediately advise the Philadelphia Office.

OBSERVATIONS:

The above information, if accurate, represents a serious violation of the agreement regarding confidentiality existing between the SSC and members of the intelligence community as it relates to material being turned over or made available to Staff Members of the Committee. It is incumbent

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75

upon this Bureau to make the above information available at the earliest logical time and in the most complete form possible to the Department, CIA, and Senators Frank Church and John G. Tower of the SSC. Accordingly, an interview by Bureau Agents of Thweat's niece, if she agrees to cooperate, would appear desirable before initiating any action on the basis of information received to date.

Additionally, it is not known at this time whether or not the document reportedly Xeroxed by O'Flaherty is classified. In our continuing inquiry into this matter, attempts will be made to identify document, determine whether it contains classified information and ascertain whether or not a violation of Federal statutes exists.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.  That contact be maintained with the Philadelphia Office to insure that the desired information concerning Thweat's niece be expeditiously obtained. If she agrees to cooperate, she will be immediately interviewed and pertinent information obtained furnished, via established liaison channels, to the Department, CIA, and Senators Church and Tower. Appropriate field offices will be instructed to conduct necessary investigation to corroborate the information and to determine if a possible violation of Federal statutes has been committed.

2. If Thweat's niece declines cooperativeness, pertinent information obtained thus far will, in memorandum form concealing identity of source, be furnished via established liaison channels to the Department, CIA, and Senators Church and Tower. Additionally, a lead will be sent to the Memphis Office to interview Professor Katz at the University of Vanderbilt in an attempt to corroborate the allegation.

The Intelligence Division advised Philadelphia Office
telephonically informed FBIHQ on 8/5/75 that Thweat had returned to
Philadelphia from seeing his niece and indicated she would talk to the
FBI on the condition that she would go to Philadelphia about 8/22/75
to talk to the Agent who is a personal friend of Thweat and to whom
he initially confided the information regarding this matter. Philadelphia
was advised in view of the time lag a more preferable alternative
would be for WFO Agents to contact the niece or as another alternative the
Philadelphia Agent would travel to Washington, D. C., to conduct
the interview. Philadelphia was requested to expeditiously recontact
Thweat concerning the above possibilities.

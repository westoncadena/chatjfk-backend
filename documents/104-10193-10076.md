## W. Harvey, C.I.A. Aide, Dead;
Linked to Anti-Castro Plotting

William K. Harvey, reported: At the time of his death, Mr.

tral-Intelligence Agency group Bobbs-Merrill Publishing Com
set up in the 1960's to plan the pany.

Mr. Harvey, who was 60 son, James D. Harvey.
years old, was said to have
been in charge of the agency's
efforts against Prime Minister
Fidel Castro of Cuba. He was
among 10 agents whose iden-
tities were disclosed by the
Senate Select Committee on In-
telligence after an investigation
in 1975 of alleged assassination
plots by the United States.
William E. Colby, then Direc-
tor of Central Intelligence, had
argued that disclosure of the
names of agents would put
them in jeopardy of retaliation
by "irrational groups."

Mr. Harvey testified before
the Senate committee that he
had been told by superiors that
the Castor assassination plot had
been approved at the highest
levels of the government, and
that he had discussed the ef-.
forts with his immediate super-
ior, Richard Helms, who later
became director of the agency.

Mr. Harvey moved to Indian-
apolis in 1969 after retiring
from the agency, where he had
worked for 22 years. He worked
for the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation from 1940 to 1947.

LLOGAGE - Notification of Designation as a Participant in
the Organization Retirement and Disability System

Action: As indicated

Ref: Book Dispatch 5096 & OIRS-7586

1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement and Disability System and have been so designated effective 21 November 1965.

2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons, the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such a determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this technical requirement may be satisfied, you are hereby notified of your right to appeal. An appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of this dispatch or acceptance of designation will be assumed, Any questions that you may have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to Book Dispatch 5096 should be forwarded to Headquarters.

3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the benefits of the Civil service Retirement system, however, there are a few situations in which an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service system, because of this, the policy decision has been made that a participant in the Organization system who would receive a higher annuity under the Civil service system may, not later than one year prior to his retirement, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil service system. Thus, you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

Mr. Harvey has continued to minage the Agency's activities in Twly with the same enthusiasm and drive which characterized the description of his approach to the Station Chief role in his past Fitness Report.

In his efforts to reorient the Rome Station's FI program toward Soviet-Satellite targets Mr. Harvey has-devoted considerable energy to acquiring the basic information needed for this task. This has been well reported and the responsibilities for corry- ing out this shift in operational approach have been precisely delegated. It is still early to assess the results operationally but the reorientation has been well organ ized. As an early indication of the trend this is taking, several successful technical operations have been established which are well on target..

To accomplish the objectives of the CA responsibilities of the Rome Station Mr. Harvey has acquired the most competent officers with this highly specialized skill and has staunchly supported their efforts to prosecute this program which remains extensive.. He has considerably improved the Station relationship with Embassy officers, including the Ambassador, by devoting greater effort to this necessary phase of the Station Chief's role and the Ambassador, during a recent trip to Washington, made special mention of the degree of confidence he had in the Station's reporting and in the extent to which it has kept him properly informed.

During the period under review Mr. Harvey nequired a Deputy Station Chief - for whose arrival he had waited more than 6 months. He has delegated general management of the Station's activities to this officer, who has applied himself diligently to this task and the results have been promising. Mr. Harvey has been receptive to headquarters guidance, is extremely prompt and thorough in replying to his correspondence. (cont'd)

Section C (cont'd)

Some administrative details, such as the reports on the performance of.. officers whose evaluation he was reluctant to make, Mr. Harvey has had a tendency to postpone despite repeated efforts to provoke him into timely response.

I have rated Mr. Harvey's overall performance outstanding in recognition of his superior supervisory ability, his unusual skill in expressing his views and his determination to accomplish his basic objectives regardless of the obstacles which he encounters. The Rome Station is complex, is engaged in some highly sensitive operations which must be guided with a strong hand and by an officer with a degree of professionalism which Mr. Harvey is well able to supply as a result of his extensive operational experience.

3. BY REVIEWING OFFICIAL

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on duties No. 2, 3 and 4. I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than "strong," with justification. I also think, however, that duty No. 1, involving the overall administration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more appropriately be rated "proficient," or perhaps "strong."

I concur in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on duties No. 2, 3 and 4. I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than "strong," with justification. I also think, however, that duty No. 1, involving the overall administration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more appropriately be rated "proficient," or perhaps "strong."

Amplify or explain ratings given in Section B to provide best basis for determining future personnel action. Manner of performance of managerial or supervisory duties must be described, if applicable.

Mr. Harvey has continued to manage the Agency's activities in with the same enthusiasm and drive which characterized the description of his approach to the Station Chief role in his past Fitness Report.

In his efforts to reorient the Rome Station's FI program toward Soviet-Satellite targets Mr. Harvey has devoted considerable energy to acquiring the basic information needed for this task. This has been well reported and the responsibilities for carrying out this shift in operational approach have been precisely delegated. It is still early to assess the results operationally but the reorientation has been well organized. As an early indication of the trend this is taking, several successful technical operations have been established which are well on target.

To accomplish the objectives of the CA responsibilities of the Rome Station Mr. Harvey has acquired the most competent officers with this highly specialized skill and has staunchly supported their efforts to prosecute this program which remains extensive. He has considerably improved the Station relationship with Embassy officers, including the Ambassador, by devoting greater effort to this necessary phase of the Station Chief's role and the Ambassador, during a recent trip to Washington, made special mention of the degree of confidence he had in the Station's reporting and in the extent to which it has kept him properly informed.

During the period under review Mr. Harvey acquired a Deputy Station Chief - for whose arrival he had waited more than 6 months. He has delegated general management of the Station's activities to this officer, who has applied himself diligently to this task and the results have been promising. Mr. Harvey has been receptive to headquarters guidance, is extremely prompt and thorough in replying to his correspondence. (cont'd)

Some administrative details, such as the reports on the performance of officers whose evaluation he was reluctant to make, Mr. Harvey has had a tendency to postpone despite repeated efforts to provoke him into timely response.

I have rated Mr. Harvey's overall performance outstanding in recognition of his superior supervisory ability, his unusual skill in expressing his views and his determination to accomplish his basic objectives regardless of the obstacles which he encounters. The Rome Station is complex, is engaged in some highly sensitive operations which must be guided with a strong hand and by an officer with a degree of professionalism which Mr. Harvey is well able to supply as a result of his extensive operational experience.

AUG 11 1964

Mr. Harvey's management of the Agency's program in Italy has to date been characterized by the forcefulness and drive which have gained for him in previous assignments a reputation for dynamiam. He has undertaken to reorient the Rome Station's FI program toward Soviet-satellite targets and any delay in this reorientation has been due fully to our inability for administrative reasons to supply the personnel he desires on the time schedule which he would prefer.

Although not by inclination oriented toward the objectives of CA, he has preserved and guided the most complex CA program in Western Europe with understanding and skill. To accomplish this it has been necessary for Mr. Harvey to learn the intricacies of an extremely complex local political situation. This he has set about to do with confidence. His accumulated experience in earlier assignments has equipped Mr. Harvey with a self-assurance and confidence which I have rarely seen equalled in any other officer. The continuance of ideal relationships with the key Embassy officials in Rome has been somewhat handicapped by the sudden death of the principal officer in the Embassy who was knowledgeable of our program and the impossibility of bringing into knowledge of our activity the next lower level echelon of Embassy officials for reasons beyond Mr. Harvey's control. This handicap has been overcome over the past year and Mr. Harvey is currently supervising extremely sensitive political operations and contacts to the satisfaction of the Ambassador and his headquarters.

He delegates responsibilities skillfully to those officers under his command who are best qualified and by his own outstanding performance, which is always at its best under heavy stress, he earns an intense loyalty from these personnel. He demonstrates cost-consciousness and outstanding supervisory ability.

# MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: Fitness Report - Mr. William K. Harvey

1. This Fitness Report covers the period from 1 April 1962 to 15 January 1963 during which Mr. Harvey was Chief, Task Force W.

2. As a senior officer in the Clandestine Services, Mr. Harvey has behind him a long record of professional accomplishment achieved during tours in Washington as well as seven years in Berlin. He is thoroughly grounded in the tradecraft of clandestine activities, and has brought to each and every assignment an intelligent, thorough, and uncommonly conscientious approach. His qualities of leadership are attested to by the loyalty and devotion of those colleagues who have worked under his direction. If anything, there has tended to grow up within the Clandestine Services a coterie of officers who have come to regard themselves as "Harvey men", a development which Mr. Harvey himself has not encouraged but which demonstrates the strong emphasis on first-class tradecraft which he has insisted upon in each assignment.

3. As Chief, Task Force W, Mr. Harvey had the task of organizing and developing a large operational team devoted to the acquisition of intelligence and the handling of special operations directed at Cuba. He was obliged to work within a complicated bureaucratic framework, a fact which made the clearing of actions a laborious and time-consuming exercise. Under his direction, the Task Force grew substantially in sire and in professional competence with the result that when the Cuban crisis arrived in October intelligence assets were in place to make a significant contribution to the overall intelligence picture. Mr. Harvey devoted considerable ingenuity, long hours of personal tire, and great energy to this enterprise, and, although certain aspects of the intra-governmental coordination of the operations had rough sledding, his net achievement was the establishment of an effective, going concern with momentum which carries on to the present.

4. Mr. Harvey, after a strong performance as Chief, TFW, has been assigned as Chief of Station, Rome, and is now preparing himself to take over at that post in the coming months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

SUBJECT: William K. Harvey- Memorandum in lieu of fitness report for period 30 March 1960 -
10 May 1962

1. It is difficult to prepare a fitness report on this outstanding officer, largely because forms do not lend themselves to measuring his many unique characteristics. His strengths are in professional knowledge and competence in the operational field, in a toughness of mind and firmness of attitude, while the latter in past years have moved him into positions that were sometimes stronger than superior officers, with a responsibility for adjustments necessary in matters of policy in relation to Agency position in the community, were able to handle easily, his own closeness to policy positions of the Agency within the U.S. community in the last two years has found him with a real ability to handle policy matters and to adjust to necessities, without losing his firmness and his independence of thought.

2. He is sometimes accounted to be less than outgiving of information about operational matters in which he is engaged, yet it should be remembered that this characteristic has been part and parcel of a sound operational attitude in his career. He has a wide knowledge of personalities within the officer corps of the DD/P and is for the most part a good selector of officers to accomplish necessary tasks. He handles people well. He has a tremendous energy and is a loyal officer both to his superiors and to the purposes of the Clandestine Services of CIA.

3. He is one of the few distinctly outstanding officers in the DD/P.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

The following statement relates to the performance of William K. Harvey, GS 18, Chief of FI, Division D.

This officer has held a series of responsible positions in DD/P and its predecessor clandestine intelligence organization for well over ten years. He excels in the field of clandestine operations in general and especially so in that phase of clandestine staff and operational activities concerned with the procurement, handling and exploitation of highly sensitive and critical intelligence and operational materials.

His performance generally over the recent years has proved him to be one of the outstanding officers of the DD/P organization. He has demonstrated clearly superior performance both in staff responsibility at Headquarters and as Chief of Base in a very important field station where he was directly engaged in supervising and carrying on operations successfully against targets of the highest priority.

In the period under review, June 1959 to March 1960, he took over and directed functioning of one of DD/Ps most sensitive components charged with achievement by special means against targets of the highest importance. This included carrying on negotiations and liaison with other components of CIA and other Agencies and Departments of the U. S. Government concerned with his special field. His performance of this responsibility in many respects has been outstanding. He has continued to demonstrate his fitness to handle a wide range of positions of major responsibility within the clandestine service.

Among his outstanding characteristics are: thorough understanding of his profession and ability to make this clear to persons of high level whose knowledge of the Clandestine Services is general. He is firm, tenacious, and on occasions strongly aggressive in pursuit of his point of view. While this may sometimes make for difficulty on the part of those in higher echelons who wish to dispose of a complicated problem easily and quickly, this officer's persistence in carefully


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

presenting his arguments and in holding to them until their
fact and logic prevail or until policy factors override, makes
him a highly valuable asset to CIA.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

ATTENTION: Chief, Records and Services Division

FROM: Chief of Station, Germany

SUBJECT: Fitness Report - William K. Harvey
November 1957 - January 1959

1. Subject's abilities and performance are too generally known to require detailed comment. One of the very senior officers in KUDOVE he has been chief of what is probably the largest and most productive overseas Base of KUBARK for approximately seven years. During this period Subject has been personally responsible for a number of operational successes, some of which have been of national importance. Possessed of driving energy, determination and initiative, he has few equals in professional experience and competence. Throughout his administration of the Pace he has established and maintained exceedingly high standards of accomplishment, discipline and endeavor. Subject's Judgement, on occasion, is impulsive and proposals of the Base have been, from time to time, advanced and defended with greater vehemence and more exhaustively than the occasion, objectively speaking, required. Subject's basic self-discipline, good sense and loyalty, however, have prevented any such incidents, which are in large measure manifestations of the highly charged atmosphere and insistent operational pressures of Berlin, from developing into serious friction with the German Station or Washington headquarters.

2. It has been a pleasure to serve with this officer and, during his assignment, he has consistently rendered dedicated and effective service of the very highest order.

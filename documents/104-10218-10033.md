He is a very interesting character. His grandfather was Ambassador to Russia before the revolution, and he speaks extremely good Russian. He is a very sharp man who knows a lot of Soviets, and has excellent rapport with them because of his language and open manner. In his diplomatic pose, he doesn't seem to be anti-Soviet, but Source does not know his true feelings on that score. He is not anti-American, although he sometimes considers some American actions stupid. He is married, but his wife is often out of Moscow. He is able to stand a lot of liquor.

C.O. comment: AEPASSIVE stated that the Ambassador had some of his primary education in Russia and confirmed his expertise in the language and knowledgeability, but stated definitely that the ambassador is 100% anti-Soviet.

Peggy Tanner, secretary-archivist in the Danish embassy, is TANNER's wife. Terribly intelligent and good-hearted.individual. Both SCURCE and SOURCE's husband like then a lot. Remarkable thing about TANNER is that he never gets mad and is always smiling, even when things are most trying. Appears to be a very good, happy marriage. Both are first class people. Neither is Jewish. Transferred to Paris in the late spring of 1965.

NEW YORK TIMES

Mr. Theodore SHABAD

Position (Jan 65): Member, New York Times Bureau in Moscow, USSR

Most Jewish type of Jew in the entire Moscow press corps (exactly what SOURCE means by this hard to pind down - but would appear she means he keeps to his own co-religionists, and does not mix with others.) Lives in the same entryway as SOURCE. Did not like TANNER (Bureau Chief) and TANNER felt the same way about him. Has a stupid wife who talks too much at parties.

DATE ACQUIRED: September 1966.

Shabad's wife had a nervous breakdown and left Moscow.

USITED STATES

America House Club

SOURCE comments this is little more than a brothel where the lower echelons of the foreign diplomatic colony arrange trysts. There is a great deal of passing whiskey and cigaretts here, particularly among the foreign service personnel (maids, etc) of members of the diplomatic corps. At least within the French embassy the general feeling is that one should stay away from the place, 'since no diplomats of status go there, except on rare occasions (an especially good film). The enlisted American military personnel are known to use the facilities of the club to shack up with foreigners.

DATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966

*   The tone of the Club has improved greatly owing to security measures which have been introduced in controlling the people who may enter. It has now become chic and even ambassadors go there.

Mr. Marshall BREMENT

Position (Jan 65): Second secretary, US Embassy in Moscow, USSR

DATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966

He drinks and flirts. His wife is very jealous. He loves girls but Source does not think he goes around with Soviet girls.

Mr. Alan LOGAN

Position (Jan 65): Second secretary, US embassy, Moscow, USSR

A too serious type, wife never smiles. Very impressed with his position in the embassy - a "heavy" person. Both drink a good deal and only after they've had a few drinks do they let their hair down. His wife is French. SOURCE sees them at a number of American and British parties. Frequently present at African parties, since he is embassy officer responsible for African affairs. Wife is a bore.

DATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966

Source and her husband think LOGAN is an intelligence officer because the Soviets are very interested in him and publicized him as a spy for his interests in Africans in Moscow. After this article, the Africans stopped seeing LOGAN. He was very well liked however.

Position (Jan 65); Second secretary, US embassy in Moscow, USSR

They are the most socially adept members of the US embassy. They entertain well and their parties are fun. They both dance well. She serves wonderful buffets. She is French. Has visited SOURCE's father in Paris on one occasion. SOURCE has had the Provenchers to her apartment about 15 times (since Oct 62). SOURCE speculates Provencher may be an intelligence officer based on the fact that he has "too good" an apartment for his rank and more care is taken of him than of Mr. Logan in the political section..

DATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966

Source says her husband has changed his mind about PROVENCHER'S being an intelligence officer. Possibly he is one, but not in Moscow.

UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL (UPI)

Mr. Henry SHAPIRO
Position (Jan'65): Chief, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL Bureau in Moscow, USSR

SOURCE and SOURCE's husband like S. He is Jewish, sharp and quick, speaks excellent Russian. Knows a tremendous amount about Russian, very well informed. SOURCE speculates SHAPIRO may have helped the Russians in the past (she means the RIS) but does not think he has to now that he has established himself. SOURCE comments that SHAPIRO, like all Western press people have to be extremely careful what they file, otherwise they will be thrown out of the SU. This is very true in SHAPIRO's case, since he married to Soviet national who might not be able to leave with him if he were thrown out. Most noteable thing about SHAPIRO is his very extensive contacts in the dip circuit - Henry literally knows everybody worth knowing. On very good terms with past US ambassador (Thompson). Probably because of religious bonds, he is also on very good terms with current Israeli ambassador.

DATE ACQUIRED : September 1966.

Shapiro hates to spend money. He is very hard on his assistants, and very quick-tempered. He hates Edmund Stevens and his wife. He is close to the Austrian ambassador (Walter Wodak), the Italian ambassador (Federico Sensi) and the Norwegian ambassador (Frithjof Jacobsen). Recently Shapiro decided to do a story on the prostitutes who hang out at the Hotel National. He sent someone to interview some of these girls. As a result he was attacked in Pravda. Shapiro was terribly upset at this, almost crying. He is normally a very careful man. He knows all the Soviet journalists well, and possibly cooperates with them.

NEWSDAY

Mr. Edmund STEVENS
Position (Jan 65): Correspondent for NEWSDAY (USA) in Moscow, USSR

Neither SOURCE nor SOURCE's husband like. Drinks a lot, especially early in the morning - often drunk, and when so tends to make stupid remarks. However, terribly well informed about what is going on in the Soviet Union, in fact one of the best informed Western correspondents in Moscow. He has a find collection of modern paintings. SOURCE believes he probably works for the KGB, since he openly involved in black marketing, selling of ikons, and always seems to have more than enough money. He is the type who would sell his sould for cash. Daughter now in Rome, trying to become a movie actress. She was formerly a student at the Bolshoi Theater, studying ballet. She was something of a whore and slept with a number of Russians.

Edmund Stevens

Date Acquired: September 1966

STEVENS' wife told Peter GROSE of the New York Times that she was buying up paintings from Soviet artists and reselling them for a profit. Source considers Mrs. STEVENS a real bitch. STEVENS argues with her a lot. Source thinks he is no longer capable of having a sex life. Source has no doubts that he works for the KGB.

STEVENS' contacts in the foreign colony are extensive. He sees most of the important ambassadors, including KOHLER (US), HARRISON (UK), and SENSI (Italy). Among the many Americans he sees are GUTHRIE and ARMITAGE.

The only Soviet contacts of the STEVENS whom Source knows are figures from the artistic world: musicians MOISSEYEV and KAGAN, and the ballerina PLISETSKAYA.

UNITED STATES

US EMBASSY LOSCOW

General Comments:

Embassy officers all believe they are very important people by virtue of the fact that the Department sent them to Hoscow to represent the States. They try to impress everybody with their position and with their knowledge of Soviet affairs (which is not too good in the first place). They tend to live a getto-like existence, do not wis with other members of the dip set. Stay at home or in the embassy and do not get out around in the city. From a social point of view they are for the most part boring - only wish to talk business and office politics. No lightness of sense for "things gay." Heavy. Do not have many of the social graces, do not dance well, do not play cards well, etc. Wives are poor dressers and can not cook.

However, neither SOURCE nor her husband trusts the JAFFES completely - in their view something about them does not add up. JAFFE good newspaper man - knows how to ask questions that will get news. SOURCE feels she has to watch what she says to JAFFE, lest he uncover some of her husbands "sources" for news. JAFFE does a good job, knows the ropes of his profession and is a thoroughly competent journalist. Knows a great many Russians and now has very good contacts with the North Vietnamese - this rather unusual for an American correspondent in Moscow. Both are Jewish.

Their food at dinners was indifferent though of good quality. They did serve good French wines. One got the impression Mrs. STOESSEL did not take too many pains in planning and serving her dinners. She has a terrible cook. SOURCE entertained the STOESSELS in her home on about 10 occasions (from Oct 62 to the time the STOESSELS left).

Wife dresses badly, even worse than Mrs. Kohler.

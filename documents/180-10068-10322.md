# Assassination Records Review Board
Final Determination Notification

AGENCY : HSCA
RECORD NUMBER : 180-10068-10322
RECORD SERIES : STAFF PAYROLL RECORDS
AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995

Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 14
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors
including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the
absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United
States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 5

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could
reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of
privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Next, I was assigned to Harrisburg to cover the State
Legislature for a year and a half, worked on a team investigating
political payoffs and contributions . Then became "idea man"
for about a year. My best idea was to go to Europe and cover
the American troops during peacetime. Then I asked for and got
an assignment to Vietnam where I wrote a series of articles just
as the United States was getting heavily involved. Also wrote
a series about the peace-keeping forces in Cyprus.

Assigned as an assistant city editor to the copy desk,
filling in as deputy city editor. Headed a Bulletin investigative
reporting team that "broke" the FHA scandal in Philadelphia and
resulted in a federal grand jury.

Was sent to a city editor's seminar at American Press
Institute, then at Columbia University, and a short while later
was appointed deputy city editor in charge of assigning most
news stories. In that capacity I also helped train young writers
and reporters. Then assigned to the national desk, which handles
Washington, national and international news Started a weekly
column called World in Conflict.

Outside the Bulletin, I did some freelance work. Most
notably I was Philadelphia area correspondent for Time and
Fortune in 1957, worked part time at the N. Y. Daily News in
1968, wrote a number of articles for Philadelphia magainze.

Honors and awards: First prize for court reporting from the
Pennsylvania Newspaper Publishers Association, National Certificate
of Merit, Amvets, 1965, for the Vietnam series. Served as treasurer,
Pen and Pencil club and vice president and director, Phila.

Dear Dick:

I've been following the progress of the House Select Committee on Assassinations and its chief counsel as well as newspaper and wire service stories permit.

I gather, at least from a Newhouse News Service report, that the committee unanimously has agreed to support your request for a staff of 170 but that the actual funding will not follow until after January 1.

If that's the case, and you can use me now, I'd like to come to Washington and get involved as early as possible. I think I can be more effective in the role of press liaison officer if I arrive on the scene before the great bulk of the staff.

I have received a formal letter from Bulletin management confirming an extended leave of absence. But this does not preclude a short-term leave. Even if Congress ultimately refuses to fund the investigations fully and they are cut short, I feel I could return to the Bulletin without loss of face or funds. The experience of working for even a few weeks or months with the committee would be worth the effort.

Also, even though I would move to Washington immediately, Shirley and Sharon would remain in Philadelphia to June 30.

I , therefore, would not get involved with a long-term lease until the summer. So, if the investigations are terminated early, there would be little financial hardship on my part.

I understand that you are extremely busy at this point, preparing a budget and interviewing prospective staff members. But I would appreciate a call at your convenience.

I am somewhat anxious since several of the AP stories mention "a spokesman for Sprague." I recall that you mentioned a temporary press secretary, aide to Rep. Thomas N. Downing. My concern is that he may become permanent.

Best regards,

![Signature of Burt Chandler]

Dear Dick:

Here is my resume.

I'm also happy to tell you that The Bulletin has granted me an extended leave of absence. In fact, management, I am told, was "thrilled" with the idea.

The leave was granted in record time. This was a surprise. I thought it would take weeks of negotiation. That's why i went ahead and requested it now instead of waiting.

Of course, I explained in writing to The Bulletin that if for some reason the House does not provide sufficient funds for the dual investigation, the deal is off.

Now that The Bulletin has been apprised of the situation, I feel very little notice is required. This means I could start as your press secretary soon after things are worked out with the House committee.

I hope that is soon. I am anxious to get involved as early as possible.

Meanwhile, I'm reading extensively in the Kennedy-King literature. I'm also meeting with an old friend, the press officer for the Federal Energy Administration here, to get some ideas about dealing with the media from the other side of the fence.

I will be in Washington, Monday and Tuesday, Nov. 8 and 9,

to attend information seminars with my daughter, Sharon, at
the three universities. As I told you, she plans to go to
Georgetown, American or George Washington.

If it's all right with you, I'd like to stop into
the temporary offices of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations when I'm down there.

Meanwhile, best regards,

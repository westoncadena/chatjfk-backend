SUBJ: DCD CASE 65805 - BRUCE BERKMANS

REF: MAINWARING/FRENCH TELECON OF 9 SEPTEMBER 1976, SAME SUBJECT

1. FOR THE RECORD, THE PRIMARY PURPOSE FOR BRUCE BERKMANS' REQUEST THAT I SEE HIM WAS TO ENABLE HIM TO REFER A POSSIBLE APPLICANT FOR STAFF EMPLOYMENT TO THE AGENCY. FWILL INFORMALLY RAISE THIS MATTER WITH THE PERSONNEL RECRUITER WHEN HE IS NEXT IN THE MIAMI FIELD OFFICE. BERKMANS HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS MATTER AND WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO PLAY THE ROLLE OF A HELPFUL INDIVIDUAL.

2. HE ALSO REVIEWED SOME PROJECTS THAT HIS ORGNIZATION WILL BE INVOLVED IN BOTH LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. AS OF THIS DATE IT IS TO EARLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE MIGHT HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THESE MATTERS. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO REPORTABLE INTEL OR OPERATIONAL MATERIALS.

3. BERKMANS ALSO DISCUSSED HIS COMPANY'S APPROACH TO EXECUTIVE PROTECTION AGAINST THE THREAT OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM. THIS MAY BE STILL ANOTHER AREA IN WHICH HE MIGHT OCCASIONALLY VOLUNTEER A USEFUL ITEM.

4. AS NOTED EARLIER, SINCE HIS DECISION TO REFRAIN FROM ANY LITIGATION INVOLVING THE AGENCY, HE SEEMS TOTALLY RELAXED MY PERSONAL APPRAISAL NOW IS THAT HE WILL POSE NO PROBLEMS FOR US IN THE FUTURE DESPITE THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF A FEW YEARS AGO.

REF: DCD/HEADQUARTERS 15734

1. I MET AGAIN ON 2 JULY 1976 WITH BRUCE BERKMANS. IMMEDIATELY HE REITERATED WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME ON THE TELEPHONE: AFTER CONSULTATIONS WITH HIS ATTORNEY AND CONSIDERABLE REFLECTION HE HAS DECIDED THAT HE WILL NOT SUE THE AGENCY OR ANY STAFFERS OR FORMER STAFFERS. HE ATTRIBUTES THIS DECISION TO WHAT HE CALLED THE INORDINATE COSTS IN BOTH TIME AND MONEY. HE ALSO VOLUNTEERED HIS FEELING THAT THE AGENCY WAS BEING KICKED FROM EVERY SIDE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO ADD TO THE PROBLEM.

2. BERKMANS WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE COMPOSED AND RELAXED AT THIS SECOND MEETING ALMOST AS IF HE WERE RELIEVED AT FINALLY HAVING COME TO A DECISION. HE THEN REPEATED WHAT APPEARS NOW TO BE A SINCERE OFFER TO ACT ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND IN A NONOPERATIONAL CAPACITY AS A NORMAL DCD CONTACT. HE MENTIONED VOLUNTARILY THAT HE HAD SOUGHT AND OBTAINED THE CONSENT OF HIS BOSS GEORGE WACKENHUI IN THIS RESPECT.

3. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT BERKMANS IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS FOREIGN PROJECTS WHICH COULD BE OF INFORMATIONAL INTEREST TO US. I WAS, NONETHELESS, DELIBERATELY VAGUE AND NONCOMMITTAL WITH REGARD TO HIS OFFER. I AM, HOWEVER, LESS WARY OF SOME SORT OF RELATIONSHIP THAN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN BASED PURELY ON OUR FIRST INTERVIEW. IN ANY EVENT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE WILL HEAR FROM BRUCE BERKMANS AGAIN. E2 IMPORT CL BY 911668

MEMORANDUM FOR: DCD/OSB

23 June 1976

ATTENTION: Mr. Jon French.

SUBJECT: Contact with Former Staff Agent

1. This will confirm our green line telephone conversation of 22 June 1976 concerning a recommendation that DCD contact Mr. Bruce Berckmans Jr., (201-309117), a former staff agent under the LPGLOBE program. Mr. Bercbians recently telephoned an Agency staff officer with whom he is acquainted, indicating that he had information of interest and needed to talk with some one from the Agency. Mr. Berekmans is currently employed by the Wackenhut Corporation in the Miami area.

2. We discussed this case with Mr. Anthony Goldin, Assistant General Counsel/DDO, who felt that a representa tive of the Agency should meet with Mr. Berckmans to see what he had on his mind. Mr. Goldin said we would not be in violation of any Agency regulations or guidelines since Mr. Berekmans was the one requesting the meeting. Mr. Goldin recommended that contact be made through an overt employée (DCD) rather than through the LA/Miami Station.

3. Upon learning of your two immediate intel reports on 22 June, from private investigator sources, concerning plans for possible assassination of Caribbean leaders, we felt there may be a connection between these reports and Mr. Berckmans' information. It is for that reason that we suggested thật DCD might want to move rapidly on this matter.

4. As mentioned on the green line, Mr. Berckmans' address is 3941 Midway St., Miami, Florida; his telephone number is (area code 305) 443-2260.

   REQUESTING THAT I READ A MULTIPAGE LETTER WHICH HE IS THINKING
   OF SENDING TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. IT IS A DETAILED
   STATEMENT OF GRIEVANCES STEMNING FROM HIS FORCED RESIGNATION
   AND INDICATES THAT HE IS CONSIDERING A SUIT AGAINST THE AGENCY.
   HE HAS IN FACT RETAINED COUNCIL, APPARENTLY ANOTHER FORMER
   AGENCY STAFFER, BUT THEY HAVE NOT YET DECIDED WHETHER TO
   PROCEED WITH LEGAL ACTION. OTHER ELEMENTS SHOULD PROBABLY BE
   INFORMED.

2. THE PRECEDING NOT WITHSTANDING, BERCKMANS, WHO IS
   FOND OF SAYING THAT HE RESIGNED FROM THE AGENCY BUT NOT THE
   UNITED STATES, OFFERED TO SERVE AS A FAIRLY TYPICAL DCD
   CONTACT WITH RESPECT TO THE INFORMATION HE DERIVES IN HIS
   REGULAR WACKENHUT DUTIES. BERCKMANS UNDOUBTEDLY HAS MANY
   USEFUL CONTACTS ESPECIALLY IN LATIN AMERICA AND SOON IN
   THE MIDDLE EAST. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS MIGHT
   BE A USEFUL INFORMATIONAL RELATIONSHIP.

3. I TOLD BERCKMANS, HOWEVER, THAT IN VIEW OF THE
   CIRCUMSTANCES, DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH | ABOVE I FELT IT
   INAPPROPRIATE FOR US TO MAINTAIN ANY SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIP
   AT THIS TIME. SHOULD HE DECIDE NOT TO PROCEED WITH HIS
   SUIT AND OTHER THINGS FALL INTO PLACE, PERHAPS A FUTURE
   USEFUL CONTACT COULD BE ESTABLISHED.

4. IN DESCRIBING HIS DUTIES BERCKMANS DID DROP ONE MINOR
   PIECE OF INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL AGAINST THE CURRENT

1. Forwarded as Attachment One under separate cover are seven contact reports prepared by source B. Aviation on recent developments of the LIRING-3 Operation dated 27 and 28 July, 1, 3 (two reports), 5 and 9 August 1967 (two reports). One of the reports dated 3-August is a monthly resume of operational activities for the south of July. It is forwarded together with the other reports rather than separately to give as complete a picture as possible of LIRING-3's dealings with Moises OROZCO Leal, the circumstances in which the two men met and the reporting of these dealings by LIRING-3 to ROWTON. Forwarded as Attachment Two, also under separate cover, are photo copies of a two page typewritten message left by OROZCO at LIKING-3's apartment on 1 August. Another copy of this message is being forwarded Guatemala City seperately.

## SECRET/KAPOK

HMA-32778 :

2. There is little question that LIRING-3 seized the opportunity given him by the sudden apperition of OROZCO on the scene to cover vis a vis his wife a few days of misbehaving. Instead of proceeding to Tapachula to receive from the FAR new contract instructions in Mexico City (an awkward arrangement to say the least), LIRING-3 remained at the safe house he uses in the capital to receive the visit (as indicated by LIFEAT) of Berta VICISSER his "regular" mistress, Silvia DURAN (of Lee Earvey OSWALD fame) and possibly a certain Yolanda (who appears for the first time in this operation and whose phone number is not in the Station reversed Mexico City telephone directory) Pinned down on the fact that he was in Mexico. City during the period of 19 to 21 July, LIRING-3 admitted that he was but felt that he had to tell another lie racher than aduit his misbehavior. This lie was that he did not want to appear dependant on Sergio VALDEZ in the eyes of ROWTON and so wade his first meeting with OROZCO "more intriguing" by inventing the trip to Tapachula. To add credence to the Tapachula story, LIRING-3 previously asked his wife to impress ROWTON with her concern for his, telling ROWTON that he had disappeared for three days without telling her where he went. This she did very convincingly with much sobbing and crying. The LIROSIN LP which continues to experience technical difficulties now and then did not operate properly that day (it's recorder broke down) but, as luck will have it LIROSIN live monitored conversation between LIKING-3 and his wife during which the latter reported that her tears seemed to have convinced

LIRING-3 coacerned the mention of the alias which ROWTON uses with LIRING-3 and 4 to various persons with whom LIRING-3 is in touch. LIFEAT coverage had indicated, for example, that LIRDIG-3 mentioned FOTO in alies to Sergio VALDEZ. This LIRING-3 denied. He produced on 3 August 1967 a written review of all the people of interest to ROWTON with whom he has been in contact indicating whether or not he mentioned O-TON's alias to them. This review is attached to one of ROWTON's reports dated 9 August.

3. What happened between OROZCO, LIRING-3, Sergio VALDEZ and Raul MORENO is explained in detail in ROWTOH's reports forwarded with this dispatch. A few additional points should probably be made here. First of all, part of the first meeting between LIRING-3 and ORCZCO at LIRING_3's sefehouse was live monitored by LIROSIN when the latter returned home from his regular bartending job in the early hours of the morning. LIROSIN heard enough (his recorder vas once more inoperative) to basically confira LIRING-3's report of his meeting with OROZCO to ROWTON. Secondly, neither VALDEZ nor MORENO vere present during the night of 31 July1 August when LIRING-3 told OROZCO that the latter was in fact a deserter from the FAR, refusing to indicate how he knew this (ROWTON had passed LIRING-3 information on OROZCO received by the Station from both LIREBEL-1 and 2). The two men arrived at LIRING-3's apartment in the early morning hours when OROZCO had admitted everything and thus do not know what prompted him to tell the truth. Thirdly, LURING-3 nsists that he told OROZCO nothing about his plastic flower business and it's contemplated use to cover activities in support of the Guatemalan rebels. According to him, CROZCO already knew this as well as other details of his dealings with the FAR. LIRING-3 presumes that OROZCO learned this from the higher-ups of the FAR guerrillas while in the hills. OROZCO mistakenly apparently thought that LIRING-3 was in the actual arms procurement business whereas his discussions with the FAR have been limited up to now to the eventual transportation of FAR acquired supplies from Northern Mexico to Guatemala (with the FAR assuming the responsibility of smuggling these supplies over the Guatemalan border). LIRING-3's plastic flower business designed to cover support activities on behalf of the FAR, is not, as a matter of fact operative yet. Thus OROZCO was badly informed of LIRING-3's activities. How OROZCO hoped to obtain arms from LIRING-3, had the latter been able to deliver some at the Guatemalan border area, in view of the fact (as he later admitted) that he was stone broke, is a matter of conjecture. A desperate man may do desperate things and LIRING-3 could have found himself in serious trouble. Judging from the FAR's shooting habits it is a good thing in any case that OROZCO was not armed during the argument at LIRING-3's apartment the night of 31 July to 1 August, particularly when VALDEZ started to threaten him.

4. This Station believes that the LIRING-3 Operation has reached a critical point as a result of the OROZCO affair. Both the Cubans and the FAR (via Ernesto CAPUANO Del Vecchio) have been notified by LIRING-3 of OROZCO's conduct and statements (a copy of OROZCO’s message forwarded as Attachment Two was given CAPUANO). If the FAR is at all interested in LIRING-3 he will somehow hear from the Guatemalan guerrillas and negociacions concerning arms and equipment will he rearmed. LIPING-3 has not heard from "GARCIA" since June and does not even know if the latter is in Mexico. It is the Station's opinion that he probably will hear nothing directly from the Cubans.

5. Headquarters will note, per ROWTOH's report dated 28 July, the relative case with which LIRIFG-3 claims to be obtaining a false passport and other identity papers. The Cuban's passports that LIRING-3 purchased in Nuevo Laredo, mentioned in the same report, vere issued in 1953 and 1959 and may be of marginal value. They will nevertheless be forwarded to Headquarters together with other documentation held by the bearers of these passports.

27 July, 1967

1.  LIRING/3 reported to Rowton at brief preliminary debriefing that during Rowton absence a Guatemalan (unidentified) telephoned him a safehouse and instructed him go to Tapachula on 19 July and await contact in lobby of local moviehouse. LIRING/3 stated that he took trip and was approached in lobby by same xxxxx young Guatemalan woman (with criental features) whom he had met in Guatemala City during his last trip. This woman simply informed him that a cozarade would contact him (L/3) as his home in next few days and disuuss future operations. 6/3 continued that he returned to Mexico 6ity next day and was contacted at his hoze by Guatemalan aged about 45, mustache, glasses, balding head, slightly hooked nose, wearing hat ixxxtxzRi who later stated his true name is Moises Crozco Leal and that he has been in Mexico past twenty years.

2. At meeting next day in safehouse Crozco informed 1/3 that he ordered by Montes group to establish contact with 1/3 in order expedite first shipment of arms and ammo which urgently needed. Then 1/3 mentioned possiblity airlift from San Cristóbal area through small privately chartered plane, Orozco intensely interested and acceded to 1/3 request that he first meet with "responsible high-level" FAR representatives. Crozco stated that in his opinion 1/3 should discuss whole operation with Montes himself and volunteered to ar ange meeting in near future.

3. LIRING/3 states that he is awaiting further instructions from Crozco and is prepared for trip to Chiapas once final armangements made.

4. Re Garcia 1/3 reported that he has not reappeared and when he queried Orozco abcut him, ixxx Orozco stated be personally not acquainted with him, since strict compartmentation being enforced. Also in course & conversation Drozco stated that only part of the medicines procured by L/3 had arrived at their dexxtination and its presumed that remainder was captured by Guatemalan army. He added that FAR needed a doctor urgently for about ten days and would appreciate L/3 a ranging this if feasible. L/3 suggested to Rowton that Raúl Moreno, who is in third year of medical studies, night qualify if Rowton could not come up with fully qualified doctor.

28 July 1957

Subject: Wallace B. Roxton Meeting with LIII.0/3.

1. On the morning of 27 July, 1957, the day after his return to Mexico City, Roxton contacted LIRING/3 at his home and arranged for a meeting at the safehouse at 1130 that same morning. 2/3 commented that he was greatly relieved that Roxton had returned safely since many things had happened during his absence and 1/3 had felt uncertain about what he should do in the event Roxton had been delayed any longer.

2. At the 1130 meeting at the safehouse, LIRING/3 reported that he and LIRING/4 had accompanied 1/3's half brother in his car to Sabinas, Coat., related that immediately on arrival he had his half-brother introduce him as planned to the judge in Nueva Rosita, a small village near Sabinas. L/3 reported to Rowton that the judge is named Francisco Mario Valdez Hernández and is actually a "Juez Menor" but also a notario publico and an "agente del Ministério Público", and, as such, has authority to issue important documents. According to L/3, judge Valdez, who gave the appearance of a homosexual, spoke openly about his ability and willingness to issue false documents and arrange for a passport for 1/3 in the alias Alberto Zárate. He promised to take care of the matter for the sum of 2,000 pesos, but accepted a down payment of 1,500 pesos and gave 1/3 a receipt for this amount "para el areglo de un pasaporte mexicezo", addressed to Alberto Zárate Vidal. In addition LIRING/3's half-brother persuaded the judge to arrange for the issuance to Alberto Zárate of an identity card showing that Zárate was an "actuario" of the Ministry of Labor, and for a driver's license, so that Zárate would have additional documents attesting to his identity.

3. LIRING/3 commented that he was certain that he could arrange for false papers for Rowton in the event the latter felt he could use such papers. 1/3 continued that he and 1/4 then proceeded to Nuevo Loredo and picked up the three Cuban passports that his half-brother had purchased on his behalf for the sum of 500 pesos. L/3 explained that although the persons to whom the passports were issued were dead they might conceivably be of use to Rowton in the future. He added that the hotel clerk who sold the documents to his half-brother had originally asked 1,500 pesos but apparently was glad to get the 500 when it was offered in cash on the table.

4. LIRING/3 continued that he and L/4 returned to Mexico City on 14 July

taking the bus at Torreón. LIRING/3 then announced jubilantly that a few days after his return, while he was visiting the safehouse in the hope of Rowton's return or at least a telephone call, he received a telephone call from an anonymous man, obviously a Guatemalan, who asked whether he could make a trip to Tapachula in order to meet with a friend. Then L/3 indicated that he could make the trip, the person instructed him to wait in the lobby of the Figueroa movie house until he was approached by the "friend". LIRING/3 told Rowton that he then proceeded by train to Tapachula (on 19 July) and waited in the lobby as instructed. To his great surprise, he was approached by the same Guatemalan young woman who had met him in Guatemala City in late January, 1967, and told that a certain: "Valentín" would contact him at his home in Mexico City in the near future and that this person was to be his new contact with FAR. LIRING/3 continued that

to Mexico City on 21 July in order to await the arrival of "Valentín". According to LIRING/3 this occurred in a rather strange way. Then he returned home he found a note under the door with a brief text stating that someone had passed by to see him. The note was signed with a five-pointed star rather crudely drawn in the place of a signature. L/3 stated that he was completely puzzled at this, but on reflexion felt that the five-pointed star meant 1700 and he therefore went to the safehouse at 1700 that day to await further contact. According to L/3, a person did telephone him shortly after he arrived and identified himself as "Valentín". He asked L/3 to await another call at 1030 the following day so that a meeting could be arranged. L/3 continued that he finally succeeded in meeting with "Valentín" and brought him to the safehouse on the evening of 25 July. He stated that he talked with this person until 0400 the following morning.

5. LIRING/3 reported that "Valentín", who identified himself by true name as Moisés Orozco Leal, Calle Tenis 88, Apt 5, Zona 21, Country Club, Col. Churubusco, Mexico City, D.F. Orozco stated to L/3 that he had been in Mexico some twenty years and had been engaged in propaganda work for the FAR. He added that recently he had received instructions to contact L/3 and talk with him "very frankly" concerning the procurement problem. He explained to L/3 that Far had had very disappointing experiences in the past and was in desperate need of secure and efficient channels for the procurement of arms and ammunition from the U.S. and Mexico. He stated that FAR had the cash necessary to purchase the arms and hoped that LIRING/3's commercial network could handle the procurement and transport. He indicated to L/3 that FAR had checked him out with favorable results both locally and with

the Cubans. In the course of conversation "Valentin" mentioned that Coc-
tora Mercedes Fereira, whom 2/3 had met in "avaza, was currently in Hexi-
co. "Valentín" states that it was a very critical tize for PAR and that
everyone hoped that something would be rsolved in Havana with regard to
concrete aid from the Cubans. Za indicated that in the past both the Cubans
and the Soviets had done more talking that producing in both material and
hard cash. In speaking of the most inmediate needs, "Valentic" stated that
FAR needed a dochter argently to train the revolutionaries in first aid,
and he asked 1/3 whether he could recommend a doctor that might be silling
to visit FAR headquarters for about ten days for this purpose. 1/3 told
Eowton that he rozised to look into the matter sconest, alling that he hać
in mind his friend Rail Coreno Conchee, who was a medical student and pro-
bably qualified to give first aid instruction.

5. LIRING/3 continued that he expressed his w٩٦٦٩٠٠٠
   arns procurecent effort, but would prefer to be able to talk irectly with
   FAR leaders to get first-hand information as to their needs, and arrange
   secure methods of payment. Then 1/3 referred to the delinquent account
   (medicine and radio tubes) Walentin" relpied that unfortunately only part
   of the medicine had arrived intact, the other part presumedly having been
   captured by the Guatemalan aray. He promised that 1/3 would be paid afr
   for the material furnished and apologized for not having the money with his
   he added that he receives com francial assistence from FAR and has to live
   as best he can from his own resources. In reply to 13's query, "Valentín"
   stated that he did not personally know "Gardia", since Far insisted on con-
   partmentation, and there had been no need for him to meet "Carcia" in the
   past. He then lectured 1/3 or security, stating that FAR prinicipal :ro-
   blem to date had been within the organization itself result from laxness
   on the part of revcluticmarinis and outright betrayal by some members. He
   added that LIRING/3 had been assigned the battle-name "Rafael" and that
   henceforth he should use that name whenever dealing with FAR members.

6. LIRING/3 told Rowten that, in the course of conversation regarding possib-
   le supply channels, ta zenticed the possibility of air-drops from scall
   privately chartered planes, using the Raúl Moreno as a pilot. According to
   1/3, "Valentin" showed immediate interest in this, commenting that he vas
   certain FAR would be most interested. He then stated that he felt 1/3 was
   an important enough asset to meet directly with César Kontes tiaself and
   he promised to look into the possibility of arranging a personal interview.
   1/3 replied that he would welcome this opportunity since it would clarify

the entire picture for his and enable him to render the most efficient service to FAR. "Valentin" promised to have some specific word on this at their next meeting which he requested for 28 July, promising to come to L/3's home between 1500 and 1700. "Valentin" explained that although the safehouse appeared to be an excellent meeting place, it was FAR policy not to use the same apartment or place of meeting more than once.

7. Rowton met with LIRING/3 again at 1430 on 29 July, 1967, at the safehouse The second meeting had been scheduled for 1900 on 22 July, but on arrival at the safehouse, Rowton found a note from L/3 stating that he would not be able to make the 1900 meeting but would see Rowton at 1430 the following day. The only explanation in the note for the delay was "cosas muy importantes han sucedido". When Rowton met with LIRING/3 that same day at 1430, the latter explained that "Valentín" had left a note at his home saying the meeting would be delayed, and then appeared unannounced when L/3 was not at home and talked briefly with LIRING/4. L/3 stated that he alarmed DIRNG/4 by stating that he ("Valentín") had a wounded man that must be taken care of urgently and asked L/4 to pass on the message to L/3 in the hope that L/3 could look into the possibility of locating a good trusted doctor. "Valentin" promised to come back to the house as soon as he could. According to L/3, "Valentin" reappeared unannounced at about 1000 on 29 July, and showed L/3 a telegram which he had just received from Guatemala City. The telegram contained the text "If you are interested in further details concerning the business, present yourself here", and was addressed to "Valentin" in his true name and address. L/3 stated that he could not recall the sender's name or address but he assumed that it would be an alias in any case.

8. According to L/3, "Valentin" explained to him that the telegram meant that a meeting with Cesar Montes could be arranged and that L/3 should accordingly prepare himself for the trip. In reply to L/3's query, "Valentin" stated that this took priority over the operation involving the wounded comrade, who was expected in Mexico City in about 7-8 days. "Valentin" then stated that he and L/3 would have to make a trip to Tapachula as soon as feasible and in order to receive from a FAR contact a sealed envelope containing the name of the first contact in Guatemala City. He added that he himself would not know what was in the envelope and would himself proceed on into Guatemala with the FAR contact who delivered the letter. He added that L/3 would then have to return to Mexico City and fly into Guatemala City under commercial cover, since it would be too dangerous to


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 16

proceed on to Guatemala City from Tapachula by air (the airport being small and all travelers being subject to the curiosity and scrutiny of the local officials). Valentin then stated that L/3 should be able to pass through the Guatemala City airport without difficulty provided he kept his eye out for a certain José Linares, an ex-Chief of Police who worked for the North-American Embassy and had a complete file on all suspect persons who might enter or leave the airport. "Valentin" described Linares as a man of short stature, thin, grey hair combed in a high peak in front, usually dressed in a double-breasted jacket. "Valentin" added that Linares was considered the most dangerous man at the airport, although he is not an official but simply a secret agent of the North Americans.

9. "Valentin" then, according to L/3, stated that the latter should procure the following items at once so that he could bring them to Tapachula with him:

1.  Khaki shirt and trousers (pantalón y camisa de lona muy gruesos)
2.  Leather combat boots (zapatos de campaña)
3.  Browning or Walter 9mm automatic weapon with 3 clips and 50 rounds of ammunition.
4.  Detonators with wick or electric fuse
5.  Gauze for medical treatment
6.  Three pills of most potent poison available.

"Valentin" explained that the Browning automatic was the best since it could be converted easily into a "machinegun" with its clip of 13 cartridges. The Walter was also good since it could be fitted with a silencer. "Valentin" also explained that the poison capsules were desirable to be taken in the event of capture by the army to avoid the possibility of someone confessing under torture. He added that one was for the use of L/3 and the other two for the comrades who would be his escorts.

10. "Valentin" further explained that L/3 should open the sealed envelope he had received in Tapachula when he was aboard the plane enroute to Guatemala City, memorize the name and address and then destroy the paper. He added quickly that he realized L/3 could open the envelope any time after he received it in Tapachula, and he was free to do so, but it was hoped for security reasons that he would open it only after he had left Mexico City airport. "Valentin" added that he himself had no idea of that name would appear on the paper, but in any case he was sure that it would be the name of a person not directly involved in revolutionary activities.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 17

6. 
LIWING/3 was to pay a friendly visit to this person, making no reference to politicians, but simply using a prearranged code word in the conversation. This recognition signal would lead to the first meeting with the comrades (probably two) who would escort LIWING/3 to César Montes.

11. LIWING/3 stated that he had another meeting with "Valentín" at 2200 that same evening (29 July) at the Café Literario where he hopes to obtain more detail regarding the timing of the trips. L/3 said that he preferred to make the first trip (to Tapachula) on 1 August since LIWING/4 was greatly upset over the recent developments and had to be calmed down. He added that L/4 was very pessimistic over L/2's chances of returning from such a trip alive and he would have to reassure her that he intended to take all possible precautions.

12. Inasmuch as Rowton's careful review of LIWING traffic for the period 22-24 July failed to reveal any telephone call from anyone asking L/3 to make the trip to Tapachula, and in fact revealed traffic indicating that LIWING/3 was in Mexico City during the period 19-21 July, when he claimed to be in Tapachula, Rowton stated that he did not believe L/3's story regarding his initial contact with "Valentín" and his trip to Tapachula. Since Rowton's telephone answering service reported repeated messages from "señor Juarez" and L/3 himself in true name, he felt he could use this rather than intimate in any way that L/3's (safehouse) phone was tapped. LIWING/3 became thoroughly upset, as he had done on the previous occasion when Rowton had impugned his veracity, and assured Rowton with tears in his eyes that he had always been "fundamentally" honest, although he might have exaggerated in the matter of details and exact dates. L/3 was so emotionally disturbed that he felt it unwise to press the matter further at that time and proposed to L/3 that he (Rowton) meet with LIWING/4 that evening at 2200, when he would be meeting with "Valentín" again. Rowton turned down L/3's invitation to be present at the Café Literario so that he could get a look at "Valentín" himself, since Rowton hoped that the meeting would be covered in any case by the Station team (which had L/3 under surveillance since the previous afternoon).

13. LIWING/4 came to the safehouse at 2200 and Rowton was able to talk privately with her for about two hours. She arrived in a highly emotional state, alleging that she was not aware of what was happening and was sure that L/3 was heading for disaster. She exclaimed that "risking capital was one thing, but risking one's life was another," and that although she agreed with the principle of the revolution, she could not accept the terrible.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

consequences of revolutionary activities that bad suidenyly pecore a reality for her. She complained that 1/3 kept her in the dark about any things and tout she could not understand his willingness to that his life and the happiness of his fasily "sc precipitously". Then cuton questioned her discreetly as to 13's trip to Tapachula, she stated in uncontrolatle sobs (they appeared to Kwton quite genuine) Ithat he suifenyl left the preceding week, saying he was going to Chiages and dis- appeared for 3-4 days. She said she was so use she could not remember anything but the feeling of abandonment. She trencczplained that although Foxton was the only person she could tura to in a crisis like the one she went through last week, she could not locate in anywhere. She called his telephone (answering service) repeatedly and then in desperation called LIRING/7 in the hose that he would now something on di not know which Farris" she was referring to). CTETS/4 then stated that she realized suddenyl that if 1/3 were to disappear she would be sub- ject to desertation to Cuba, a fate which she apparently genuinely dreaded. Foxton assured her that he would do everything possible to see that she was taken care of in this eventuality, but she protested that 2/3 was thel cnly person she could ope to find happiness with and Forton could zot bring him back if anything happened to him.

14. Forten then stated that before 1/3 could take such a trip with serious risks involved, he would have to study the situation thoroughly. Es ex- plained that at the moment he had serious doubts regarding the contacts that have trought 1/3 to this point. 1/4 replied that she hersel had seen the latest contact ("Malentin") caly once when he came to the scuse and gave kar the message regarding the wounded person. hen Foxton queried her again concerring the trip to Tapachula, she stated that 2/3 had told her upon his return that he had asked someone else to make daily calls to low- too's answering service, and upbraided her for calling. (This would ex- plain what appeared to be 1/3's daily calls during the period 19-21 July, but it would not explain 1/3's conversations with Berte Higisser and Ser- gio Valdez of 20/7/57 and his remark to Serta sigisser on 21/7/67 that he did not go out of town after all".)

15. Rowten felt that, although his meeting with 1/4 was not particularly productive, it served its purpose in advising 1/3 indirectly that he did. not accept 1/3's story of the trip to Tapachula and his initial contact with Valentin".

# 1 August, 1967

1.  At meeting with Rowton 1700 34 July LIRING/3 reported that Moises Crozco Leal, who claimed to be L/3's new FAR liaison for procurement of arms, currently staying in his apartment on Calzada Tacubaya. L/3 explained to Rowton that at 2200 29 July meeting with Crozco, latter stated that he had instructions from FAR headquarters to escort L/3 to Tapachula for contact instructions and instructed L/3 procure immediately Browning or Walter SM automatic with 52 three clips and at least 50 cartridges plus detonators with normal or electric fuse and three poison tablets of highest possible potency which he would needs on trip from Guatemala City to Montes headquarters. Crozco, however, insisted that L/3 bring these items with him to Tapachula and added that he would ensure that they were safely delivered to Guatemala City for eventual pick-up by L/3.

2.  At end of meeting Crozco asked L/3 to put him up for the night at his home "since it was very late and in any case he wanted to discuss their travel plans further". L/3 did so without the least suspicion Crozco's true motives, and appeared to Rowton to have accepted Crozco's bona fides although he admitted that he had never heard of Crozco before latter's unexpected approach to him 25 July. L/3 stressed to Rowton that Crozco revealed an astounding knowledge Guatemalan revolution, Cuba, as well as L/3's past activities and dates his trips to Guatemala.

3.  Rowton stated to L/3 that his preliminary checks revealed that Crozco in all probability a deserter from FAR who actually using L/3's apartment as a hideout. Rowton confessed he could not understand why Crozco would want to return to Guatemala without or without LIRING/3, but urged L/3 to attempt to get the truth from Crozco posing as sympathetic but indicating that he was aware of Crozco's true status in the hope that Crozco could be moved to a safehouse and made available for thorough interrogation. L/3 agreed and arrangements made for Rowton/L/3 meeting at midnight 1 August.

4.  Then L/3 appeared at CC30 he reported enthusiastically that he had succeeded in breaking Crozco down but that he had had to call on his friends Sergio-Valdez and Raúl Moreno. Crozco stated that he had been sent to mountains to organize guerrilla bands but found everyone "stupid" and his task impossible. He added that David Casasola who was with him was undisciplined and made mistakes that led to capture of many of his men and probably to his own capture. Crozco continued insisting that he was the

only intelliging revolutionary, referring to "the FAR Party" and at one point calling Montes a "cabrón". When he asked 1/3 who had given him the information that he was a deserter and 1/3 refused to divulge his source, Crozco, according to 1/3, exclaimed: "It was Roberto; I know". Crozco then stated that he intended to form his own revolutionary movement which be named "First of May" and had approached 1/3 for support since he at the moment had no financial or material means. 1/3 told Roxton that it was then that he realized that Crozco intended to use the supplies listed para one store for his own use and that once he turned them over to Crozco he would never see them or Crozco again.

5. In reply to I/3's query as to how Crozco had gotten to him, Sergio Valdez (who joined 1/3 at the end of the session) explained in the presence of Crozco that Alberto Domingo had referred him to him and that he knew nothing of Crozco's background. At this point Valdez threatened Crozco with physical violence exclaiming to 1/3 that they must dispose of him at once so that he could not reveal vital secrets of the revolution. I/3 claimed to Roxton that he managed to calm Valdez down and get him out of the apartment. I/3 stated that he left both Valdez and Moreno "on guard" outside the apartment house in the event Crozco tried to escape before he could confer with Roxton.

6. In view of this highly explosive development Roxton instructed 1/3 to return to the apartment and attempt to persuade Crozco to accompany him to a hotel where Roxton could arrange some sort of protective surveillance until Crozco thoroughly interrogated. I/3 insisted that Crozco be kept incommunicado in view of the information he possesses about I/3, Valdez and Moreno. Roxton promised to do the best he could but insisted that Crozco be removed from the I/3's apartment as soon as possible, I/3 promised to make every effort and asked Roxton meet with him again at 0300 to discuss results his effort.

7. At 0400 Roxton met I/3 at the safehouse (where AIMING/4 had moved with their child) and I/3 reported that Crozco could not be persuaded to leave the apartment. Although he feigned calmness, I/3 realized that he was terrorized of what might await him the moment he stepped out of the apartment house. Crozco promised to talk to I/3 again at 1000 that same morning when he had more time to think things over. I/3 stated that he left Valdez and Moreno on guard outside the apartment house (in Moreno's car) on the possible chance that Crozco would make a run for it. I/3 stated that "under no circumstances" would Crozco be allowed to escape.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 21

8. Rowton, not excluding the possiblity of Crozco's comiting suicide in 1/3's apartment or attracting attention of the neighbors, recommended that 1/3, Horeno and Valdez enter the spartzent soonest and remain inside with Crozco until Bouton could work out some plan to remove him from the apartment carly izexiz that same scrning. 2/3 promised to try but was not at all sure that he could ccavince Crozco to open the door (which he had bolted from the inside). In any case he assured Bowton that he and his two friends would rezain or quard cutside ac that they could Burveil or seize Crozce the moment he left the premises. L/3 stated that he was quite certain that Crozco was unarmed and without funds and could easily be controlled by the thrzzonix Korena and Valdez, thus percitting hin (L/3) to communicate with Rowton.

9. Alternatives in this sensitive situation appear to be following:

(a) Rowtor instruct 1/3 deliver Orozco to specified place where he can be turned over to "istoleros" Mired by Roxton for pur- pose of getting Crozco off hands of 1/3 and his friends and detaining his long enough for interrogation. 1/3 assured Howton that he able make delivery and agrees desirability thorough interrogation by Rowton or person designated by hin. Delivery could possibly be arranged withot presence Valdez and Moreno,

(b) LIRING/3 reveal entire affair to and/or a FR (617 via Ernesto Capoano de Vecchio) and let decision rest with them, interrogating Crozco as best he could in the meantire in his apartment.

(c) Let Crozco escape, after giving him enough money to make his way out of town or to another hideout. permit lengthy interrogation but would

10. Alernative (a) would/involve enventual disposal of Crozco that would be acceptable Koreno and Valdez (/3 would accept Roxton final decision). 1/3 could allege subsequently that Crozco disposed of by Fowton pistoleros and report this to LIRING and FAR. Alternative (b) would mean loss to ACFACT of valuable debriefing if this deezed desirable. Alternative (c) according to LIRING/3 probably not feasible since Valdez and Moreno fanatic enough to kill Crozco themselves rather than see hin escape.

11. L/3 insists that he has not revealed Roator's coaching in this affair to either Valdez or Foreno.

3 August, 1957

Subject: LIRING/3 Report on Developments in Hoiss Orozco Case.

1. During the early morning tours of 1 August, 1957, Rowton remained in constant contact with L/3, either through brief meetings with him or through LIRING/4 who acted as a cut-out at the phone of the safehouse. When Rowton telephoned L/4 at the safehouse at about 0730 on 1 August, she stated that L/3 had called a few minutes before and passed the message that "things were a little better, but he needed help". Rowton knew that L/3 and Sergio Valdez together with Raul Moreno were surveilling the Tacubaya apartment house in order to pick up Orozco if and when he tried to leave the premises. L/3 had told Rowton at an earlier meeting (0400) that morning that when Orozco refused to accompany him peacefully to a hotel, he gave Orozco two alternatives. First he stated (bluffing) that he had a direct channel to FAR and would query FAR about Orozco and bring with him a FAR representative at 1000 that morning and if Orozco had a clear conscience he would have nothing to worry about; secondly, if Orozco did not desire this he could take 300$ pesos which L/3 put in an envelope and leave the apartment for some other place of refuge. L/3 explained to Rowton that he hoped Orozco would take the second alternative so that he and Valdez and Moreno could follow him or seize him as he left the apartment. L/3 asked Rowton to assist in this operation by providing a few pistoleros. Rowton, feeling that he might be able to arrange to take Orozco off L/3's hands once he was out of the apartment (provided the Station could provide a safehouse and several unilateral agents to guard Orozco and eventually interrogate him) promised to hire several pistoleros who would be unwitting of the true situation to help L/3 and his friends. L/3 also asked for a weapon which he said might be necessary if Orozco gave his any trouble. Rowton, of course, refused to comply, saying that since Orozco was unarmed it was unnecessary at that time.

2. When Rowton talked again to L/3 on the phone (from the safehouse) the latter reported that things were still quite difficult. He explained that Orozco was still in the apartment and refused to answer the doorbell, obviously terrorized that L/3 had already notified the FAR of his whereabouts L/3 reported in addition that Raul Moreno had taken off in his car, apparently too tired to continue the surveillance; he and Sergio Valdez were consequently left alone without a car to surveil Orozco in the event he left the apartment. L/3 again appealed to Rowton for help. Rowton stalled since


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 23

2. 
he was unable to confirm whether the Station had any unilateral assets to assist or in fact was interested in taking over Crozco from 1/3 until after 0900 that morning. When Barton talked to 1/3 again on the phone at about 0915, 1/3 reported that Crozco had left the apartment at 0830 and proceeded directly via pesero to his mother's house (Cenis 188/5) in Colźnia Country Club and that 2/3 and ergio Valiez had succeeded in surveilling his there and were at that moment watching the house from near- by. About 20 minutes later 1/3 reported that Crozco had left the house and was at that moment in a nearby barbershop. 13 added that he and Valdez could not carry on the surveillance much longer since they were becoming conscicuous ( as later reported, a police car (unmarked) was spotted by Valdez in the vicinity and night have approachedi them if the house was actually under surveillance by the Kezican police).

3. Acwton therefore reported to the Station that he had instructed 1/3 to rezain on surveillance for about 30 minutes more and that unless Station assets could take over the surveillance would have to be abandoned. Howton was informed that a decision bai been made to request the Mexican police to arrest Crozco at the home of his mother and that therefore L/3 could be taken of the case. Rowton zet with 1/3 again at the safehouse at about 1030 and the latter reported that he and Sergio Valdez had been forced to abandon the surveillance effort. Eowton alleged that in the meant ze he kad rounded up three "pistoleros" and sent them to the house but shortly thereafter had received from them a "danger signal", indicating that the house was being watched by the Mexican police and that they could not become involved. As a result they had left the area and could not be of any further use. ( Eowton felt constrained to invent this story since he was aware that Crocco's arrest was icinent and in crder to throw the blame off himself when the report reached 1/3 and Valdez).

4. Roston met with 1/3 that afternoon at 1700 at a small coffeeshop on Reforma and denied to L/3 that he had any knowledge of what had happened to Crozco in the meantime. L/3 reported that he ant Valdez were attempting to make plans as to the best course of action. Roxton advised L/3 to contact Jacobo Rodriquez Padilla and through to attempt to contact a FAR representative in Mexico City (possibly the lawyer Ernesto Capoano). L/3 agreed that this was essential since he and Valdez aud come to the conclusion that Crozco must somehow be "clialanted" before he fel; into the hands of the Kexican police since he new too much, especially about 1/3's


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 24

3. 
commercial cover plans and activities and his past connections with FIR. 1/3 promised to meet with Jacobo the following morning and press him for contact with the FAR. In the meantime Horton continued to feign ignorance of the arrest of Crozco (which took place about 1000 on 1 August, 1967).

5. Rowton met again with 1/3 at his Tacubaya apartment at 1200 on 2 August. 1/3 reported that he had talked with Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla at 1200 that xxx day in the Café literario but with disappointing results. Jacobo as usual appeared very fearful of involving himself in any way politically, and when 1/3 informed be that he had to see someone from FAR urgently and it occurred to him that the lawyer Ernesto Capoano might be able to arrange the contact, Jacobo replied that he could not vouch for Capoano at all as far as political matters were concerned. He stated that Capoano was generally helpful for Guatemalans seeking papers and legalizing their status (for which he gave his services gratis) but he was not sure that Capoano would stick out his neck for 1/3. According to 1/3 he then dropped the matter, without disclosing to Jacobo that he was interested in Crozco, feeling that it would be too risky to bring Capoano into the picture (although Jacobo had offerred to arrange a meeting with him for L/3).

C. L/3 continued that he felt his only other alternative was to talk the matter over zk with Cepeda in/LIRING office. He therefore went directly there after having talked with Jacobo, and, not finding Cepeda in, went to the office of Curbelo. He managed to see Curbelo privately and related to him the entire affair. He explained that originally he had had a very discreet contact with FAR but that, unexpectedly this contact had disappeared ("Garcia"). Recently however, equally unexpectedly, a new contact in the person of Moisés Crozco Leal had appeared claiming that he was a bona fide FAR representative and had been referred to 1/3 by Alberto Domingo of Siempre. 1/3 purposely stressed this, commenting that he assumed that alberto was in touch with LIRING and therefore a person to be trusted. 1/3 then informed Curbelo that he found several loop-holes in Crozco's story and decided to check on him. He contacted a friend in Guatemala and discovered to his amazement that Orozco had deserted from FAR and was actually in hiding in Mexico. 1/3 revealed to Curbelo that Crozco had locked himself in L/3's apartment the preceding right after he had confessed to 1/3 his true status. L/3 concluded that as far as he knew Crozco was currently in hiding at his mother's home. 1/3 then stated that he needed desperately to communicate these facts to FAR so that appropriate action could be taken to eliminate Crozco before he fell into the hands of the Mexican police


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 25

and revealed very sensitive information about FAR as well as about his own(L/3's) involvement. 1/3 commented to Boston that Curbelo appeared thrcoughly shaken by this and his hand treabled as he made notes. De replied to 1/3 that he would comicate this development infeccely to FAR Cuba inthe hope that he would receive some guidance to pass along to L/3.

7. 1/3 then reported that he and Sergio Valdes (apparently both were disgusted with Fail Moreno for having left them holding the bag and did not recontact him again) had decided that it was essential to décover whether Crozco had been arrested so that they could plan some sort of action to "eliminate" him before he couldcounted to Puntemala. 1/3 reported that Valdez had sent his girl-friendAle garmenURBINA TORREthe graTORBE (Plaza Miravalle) to the home of moonle -athoniine auecer urozco was still there or arrested in the reantime. 1/3 later (at; 2200) that evening reported that no one had answered the door at the apartment and hence the woman friend of Valdez had been unable to learn anything about the fate of Orozco. 1/3 added that he and Valdez had struck upon another plan which they hoped would flush out the true facts. In the meantime he asked Rowten to attempt to determine whether Crozco had been arrested. When Rowton telephoned L/3 the following morning at 0900 as he had promised de agains denied any knowledge and suggested that L/3 go ahead with the plan and report to Rowton that evening at 1800. (Reuton did not wish to have prior knowledge of the plan since he felt it better for 1/3 and Valdez to proceed on their own in a spontaneous manner so that 2/3 would have a well backstopped story to give Curbelo when he met with him again.)

3 August, 1967

Subject: Monthly Report of Developments in the LIRING/3 Operation.

1. During the month of July, 1967, the most important development in the LIRING/3 operation was the approach made to LIRING/3 by Moisés Crozco Leal, who purportedly conveyed instructions to L/3 from the FAR of Guatemala for a personal meeting with César Montes in the mountains of Guatemala. This new contact was reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 at the first meeting follow-ing Rowton's return from CCT in Georgetown, Guyana (26 July, 1967). Wien Station traces revealed that Moisés Crozco had actually deserted the FAR forces some time after May, 1967, and that FAR was actively looking for him; most probably to eliminate him and thus prevent his revealing sensitive in-formation to the mexicans and/or Guatemalans regarding FAR plans and acti-vities, Rowton warned LIRING/3 against taking Crozco's statements and claims seriously and suggested that he question him carefully concerning his past connections with FAR. L/3 did so at his 31 July, 1967, meeting with Crozco, who was then living in L/3's apartment (on Calzada Tacubaya), and informed Rowton later that evening that he had "broken" Crozco, and that the latter had admit-ted that he had deserted the FAR forces and claimed to be in the process of forming his own guerrilla movement to be called "Primer del Mayo".

2. In consultation with Rowton through the early morning hours of 1 August, LIRING/3 with the help of his friends Sergio Valdez and Raúl Moreno, attempt-ed to persuade Crozco to leave L/3's apartment and remain in hiding in a near-by hotel (Which Norris K. Umphlett had rented in an alias "Antonio Sanchez" at Rowton's request). Crozco, however, refused to leave L/3's apartment with them by sneaked out at 0830 when he apparently thought that L/3 was not in the vicinity. L/3 and Sergio Valdez, however, were watching the apartment house and manged to surveil Crozco to the home of his mother in Colonia Country Club. L/3, however, on Rowton's instructions, aboandoned the surveillance of the house at about 0930 that morning. L/3 subsequently reported the affair to Curbelo of the LIRING office in the hope of getting word to FAR of the where-abouts of Crozco and of the ruse he attempted to play on L/3. The latter said that he str-ssed to Curbelo that it was Alberto Domingo of Siempre who had ori-ginally sent Crozco to LIRING/3 (through Sergio Valdez).

3. LIRING/3 continued to monitor the activities of his friend Sergio Valdez who during the month set up a company (Colrluz) in the workshop of his Mexi-can firend, señorita Alejandra Urbina Torres, at Plaza Miravalle in Mexico

City. In view of the response of the Tenecuela Station (discuracing Rowton from directing 1/3 into Venzuelan guerrilla cctivites with Corgio Valdez and Raúl Horeno) Scwton instructed 1/3 to main frenvolvement with them in this aspect of the operation. He agreed, an ever, with 1/3 that the res ccm-pany gave hin zuch-recei affitionel financial cover, especially in the eyes of the FERUMENS in the likely event that they would question him more closely fusing a future trip iste their area.

*NO FA NO MEXI OSA-*

4. Puping the conth, on a tri to Jabiras, Coch., // cucceeded through his half-brother in meeting Judge Francisco Mario Valdez of Huera Rosita who :20-nised to arrange for the issuance to 2/3 in the alias Alberto Cerate Tidal of a (false) passport. LIRIC/3 Feels that the possession of such a false focu-ment will enhance his potential in the eyes of the FERUMENS as well as FAR.

5. During his trip to northern Mexico IRC/3 also managed to "purchase" the passports of three (deceased) Cubans who had left the documents together with other papers at the hotel in Nuevo Corečo where they had stayed prior to their supposedly clandestine entry into the C.S. 2/3 prccured these documents with Fortor's prior approval on the asumption that they might prove useful to Rowton at soze future date.

6. In connection with the Moisés Crozco affair, Rowton uncovered an important instance of deception ca the part of both LIRING/3 and LIES/4. A review of LIFEAT interecepts revealed that 1/3 was in the safehouse during the perica 19-21 July, when he had claimed to Rowtch that he was on a trip to Tapachule to receive contact instructions for his first meeting with Crozco. LIENG/3 apparently asked 1/4 to backstop his story when Routen queried her separately, since she did so (although claiming ignorance of the purpose of the trip). 1/3 subsequently admitted to howtos that he had not made the trip to Tapachula but had actually net Orozco through Sergi: Valdez (who had been referre, to his by Alberto Domingo of Siempre) and that he had not wanted to reveal this to howton until he could figure out how Valdez fitted into the picture". Since Forter and the Station felt that this was an ther opportunity to Scolar IRING/3, a request was repeated to Ecadquarters for a Spanish-speaking operator. The request could not be complied with at the time and howton has had to continue checking LIRING/3's reports as carefully as he can without benefit of the technical in-terrogation.

Subject: Analysis of LIFEAAT Traffic Relating to LIRING/3 Operation. for the period 29 June to 1 August,1987.

1. During this period the most significant operational support provided by LIFEAT intercepts occurred during the period 17 July to I August, the period of LIRING/3's contact with Moisés Crozco Leal. On 27 July, the first meeting Rowton had with L/3 after Rowton's return from JDJ to Gu- jana, L/3 reported that he had been contacted in a mysterious manner by a FAR representative who identified himself by true name as Crozco. He related that he had received a telephone call requesting him to travel to Tapachula, and that he had made the trip 19-21 July, and received contact instructions to meet with a certain "Valentin" in
   Intercepts revealed, however, that L/3 was physically in Mexico City during the period 19-21 July. SIM 33(8.2) reveals that L/3 telephoned sra. Berta Wigisser and made a date for 1930 on 21/7/67 at the safehouse apartment. He commented that he did not go out of town after all. Furthermore Rowton's telephone answering service reported to him regular calls from L/3 asking for Rowton daily during the period he was allegedly out of town. This gave Rowton sufficient evidence to challenge L/3's story at his meeting on 29 July. In order to protect the security of LIFEAT Rowton used the evidence of his telephone answering service and his own intuition and logic to dis- count L/3's story of his original contact with Crozco. LIRING/3 finally confessed that he had made up the story because of the involvement of his friend Sergio Valdez (who it now appears met Crozco through Alberto Do- mingo and introduced him to L/3). LIRING/3 felt that reporting the true facts to Rowton would not have been as intriguing in Rowton's eyes and would have made him appear dependent on Valdez for this productive aspect of the operation. On the morning of 31 July, LIRING/3 justified his action by stating that he continued to feel under extreme psychological pressure to "produce" for Rowton since he felt deeply obliged to him for the con- fidence and financial support he had been giving him. He now states that he realizes that he can repay Rowton only by reporting accurately and fully all developments in his dealings with FAR and other revolutionary groups.

2. All other LIFEAT intercepts relating to the Crozco affair check out with reports given to Rowton by LIRING/3, including the latter's effort to con- tact Capoano through Jacobo Ledriquez Padilla (SIM-35(42). In SIM-33(10.2) it is apparent that L/3 has discussed "señor Harris" or at least some con- tact he has with Sergio Valdez, since he states that "he has not yet

returned. L/3 kas adritted to Porton that he has revealed to Jerato Valdez and Enrique, Chorales that he has a businessman who finances him in certain commercial ventures, but swears that he has never revealed Howton's alias to anyone ( this can most effectivley by checked in an SQCWIK examination).

3. intercepts confirm the reporta f/4 that she has made every effort to reintain social contact with Arti Cagero and Yolanda Dísz as well as Cukrbelo in the hope of keeping the door cento future re-employment in IERTAG. LIVING/4's recrts to Lovton arpaar reliable with the exception of the one relating to the alleged trip to Japachula, when 2/4 backstopped L/3's deception (although vaguely since she insisted that she did not know where he was during the verira 19-21. dicates that 1/4 is basically loyal to 1/3 and cannot be trusted to provide independent information conerning his movements and activities in the future.

LIFEAT intercerts of conversations between L/3 and his half-brother in Sabinas also confarm 1/3's reports to Boston concerning the false passport and birth-certificate for hisself in the alias Alberto Zárate.

5. Additional control information was provided in JAM-29(4.7) concerzirg 1/3's affair (azercus) with Silvia Jurán, as well as with a new women, Yolanda, with whom he attempted to make a date (34-35(9). This wozer, whose husband's first name is Rolando, has telephone 43-25-59, and tas not previcusly appeared in the 1,13 operation. Rowton has not confronted 2/3 with any data provided by of this nature in the hope of using it in an eventual 3032 interview.

# August, 1967

Subject: LIRING/3 Report of Contact with Ernesto Capoano.

1. Rowton met with LIRING/3 at 1700 at the Tacubaya apartment and remained with him until about 1900. LIRING/3 reported that he had tele- phoned Ernesto Capoano at his office on 4/3/67, after having obtained the phone number from César Tejeda Fonseca, the husband of the daughter of Ortis Rubio (ex-President). L/3 stated that he did not identify him- self to Capoano, but stated simply that he wanted to talk with him re- garding a sensitive matter. According to L/3 Capoano said quickly: "Don't mention any names, but give me some idea of what it's all about". L/3 continued that he replied simply that it concerned "the medicine". At the mention of this, Capoano requested that the caller telephone him again at 1600 on 7/6/67 for an appointment, explaining that he had to leave town over the week-end. L/3 reported Capoano's number as 48-62-09.

2. LIRING/3 continued to Rowton that when he called again on 7/8/67 as requested, still not identifying himself, Capoano asked to meet him in front of Gobernación at 1200. Each gave a general description of the other for recognition. Then, however, L/3 appeared in front of Gobernación at the time appointed, he saw no sign of anyone answering the description of Capoano (about 45 years old, wearing dark glasses, with green suit), nor was he approached by anyone. After waiting about 30 minutes in the vicinity L/3 told Rowton that he left. L/3 then stated that he planned to drop in to Capoano's home that same evening since obviously the phone call had not smoked him out. He gave the address of Capoano as Calle Bucareli 128, apt. C-7, which he stated he received from César Tejeda.

3. When Rowton met with L/3 again at 1800 on 8 August, the latter reported that finally he had managed to contact Capoano at his home (and office). He reported that at about 1930 he rang the bell and was shown into a spa- cious and nice elegant apartment and asked to take a seat in what served as a waiting room. After about twenty minutes Capoano appeared, introduced himself, and led L/3 into his office.

4. The following is a verbatim account of the conversation between Capoano and LIRING/3, as recalled by Rowton from L/3's report:

L/3: I have come to see you on a rather delicate matter that is of great concern to me personally. Can we talk safely here?

Cap: Yes, I think it is private enough here in my office. (Cap. then closed blinds) We can talk in a low voice, just to be


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

sure. what is it you wish to talk to me anut?

1/3:
It concerns a person with who have recently been in cpatact.
I must explain that I have certain commercial affairs in Cuate-
zala and travel there acre or lens regularly. I have also had
contacts of a rather felicate acture with elements therel and 2130
a contact here in Mexics vity until recently. This particular con-
tact was struct cut off for asons I am not aware of, and appa-
rently take up by the person have come to talk to you about.

Cap:
Who is this persca?

1/3:
I shall tell you later. In any case I Lave come to you since this
rerson mentioned your name and I feel that you might be in a posi-
tich to give me scue advice. I stress again that I feel my commercia
iced by this lost certant!

Cap:
So you are the person who called me last Friday.

2/3:
Well, I wanted to reach you in the most discreet manner.

Cap:
You did very well. as I told you when you called. I avoid mentioning
nates on the telephone, since I am sure that my phone is tapped. I
as afraid that in all probability ay mail is being intercepted. For
your information I was at Gobernación, just to take a look at you,
Fut I did not approach you feeling that surely you would come to my
hoze eventually.

1/3:
Fine. How let me give you an account of what has happened to me. As
I said, this new contact set with me several tices and asked for a
certain kind of help, claiming to represent certain elements in Gua-
temala and mentioning names and facts that concerned my om previous
activities there. at first I accepted him at face value, but later
be made certain comments that disturbed me. He criticized the most
important faction from that area and suddenly askeli ne to arran e
for a trip to Tapachula so that he could enter without formality.
He also akked me to put him up in my home and requested that I pro-
vide certain things that appeared strange.

Cap:
Did he ask for a revolver?

L/3: Yes, but a special ore a Browning automatic with three clips and
fifty cartridges, canvas clothes and, most surprising three poison
pills. He said there items were to be for my own use once I entered
the territory of Guatemala. All this appcarei strange to me in the
light of a previous contacts. The other people he never asked for
: such things and always had a place of their own to live in while in


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 32

3. 
Mexico City. I therefore queried him carefully, and, to make a long story short, he broke down (se abrió) *told* things that convinced me that he did not represent the main faction and had in fact deserted from it some time ago. After this he insisted on remaining in my home and I was forced to give in the following alternative. I alleged that I had another contact with his people and that I planned to consult with this contact and bring him along with me the following day at 1000 so that the three of us to continue the conversation. Then the person showed obvious alarm at this, I said that he could, however, if he choose, leave my home of his own free will and I gave him some money - 300 pesos - in an envelope, just in case he was without funds. I felt very concerned about my commercial affairs and wanted to separate myself from this person as soon as possible. I had no desire to do him any harm, despite the fact that by that time I realized that he had tried to trick me and even place my life in jeopardy. In any event he left the apartment on his own the following morning, leaving my keys, the envelope with the money, and a letter for me on the table

Cap: A letter? This is very important. Can you tell me who this man is?

L/3: Yes. His name is Moisés Crozco Leal, and he has lived many years in Mexico.

Cap: Ah, yes, I know this man. He was arrested recently by the Mexican police and released Friday. I have been informed of this by his family.

L/3: Then things are worse than I imagined. Who knows what he has revealed to the Mexicans about my business connections.

Cap: Please do not be too worried. I have been given to understand that Crozco, who is a valiant person, conducted himself in a commendable manner. I doubt that he revealed anything about you. Now the important thing for me to tell you is that I have certain very indirect delicate contacts with them there ("arrita") and I am in a position to check on this person.

L/3: I am still worried since he possesses so much detailed knowledge. I was planning-another trip-to-Guatemala City, but now I don't know what to do.

Cap: Please do not move until you have heard from me.

L/3: Fine, then here is my full name, telephone number and my references.

Cap: I really don't need references.

L/3: But I shall give them to you anyway, since I want to be aboveboard with you in all this. (L/3 then writes out names of César Tejeda and Jacobo Rodriques Padilla).

Cap: So you know César Tejada Fonseca and Jacobo. Fine. Now the important


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 33

4. 
thing is the letter. Could you give me a copy as soon as possible?
this is very important. You have done a very wise thing in coming
to see me about all this much wiser than you could realize.

L/3: The letter is typewritten on my typewritter and unsigned, but I'm
sure anyone who knows Crozco could recognize the style.

Cap: Yes. Could you send it by hand with Jaccuc? Whatever you do, please
do not telephone and talk about anything sensitive, or use names.

1/3: I could send my wife tomorrow morning, or possibly even later tonight.

Cap: Alright, but send it as soon as possible.

1/3: Just one other thing. I or anxious to get in touch with an old
friend of mine, Dra. Fereiro. I understand that she is in town, and
I might be able to contact her through you. That I suggest is this,
that you give her my name and telephone number and ask her to call
me at her convenience.

Cap: Fine. I'll do what I can. In any case I'll be in touch with you. Again
please don't leave town until you have talked with me again on this
matter.

5. Roxton made a date with 1/3 for 1030 the following day (9/3/67) to pass
   to 1/3 a copy of the Crozco letter. It will be recalled that he gave the
   original of the letter to Abelaric Curbelo. Incidentally 1/3 states that
   no mention of the Cubans was made during his conversation with Capoano.

Subject: L/3 Report of Knowledge of Rowton Alias.

1. On the evening of 8 August, 1967, L/3 gave Rowton the attached typewritten statement of the persons who might be aware of Rowton's alias, as per Rowton request to L/3 at their previous meeting.

2. L/3 has explained that he feels safe and secure from a security standpoint in his relationship with Rowton, since at present he actually does know or has known a fair number of Greeks in Mexico and Central America, including Pandelis Economou, Gazdelis, Letsakis (all of whom he has met) and Stylianos Frevolis, Angel Arvanitis, with whom he is in indirect business contact through Rowton. He feels that if Rowton's name (alias) comes up either in conversation with the Cubans or Guatemalans, he can cover it under the umbrella of his Greek commercial contacts without difficulty.

3. L/3 cannot recall either Sergio Martinez or Hugo del Pino ever bringing up Rowton name or querying him about Rowton's current activities. He recalls Martinez on one occasion many months ago simply asking him to give "señor Harris" his regards.

1. WITH ROWION INFO THAT MOISES OROZCO MAY NOT HAVE BEEN TELLING
   TRUTH ABOUT OROZCO'S ALLEGED CONTACTS WITH FAR GUERRILLAS (INFO BASED

DN LIREBEL-1 AND LIREBEL-2'S STATEMENTS PER REF) LIRING-3 SUCCESSFULLY

(CONFRONTED AND *"BROKE"* OROZCO AT HIS APARTMENT NIGHT 31 JULY IN

PRESENCE SERGIO VALDEZ AND RAUL MORENO. OROZCO ADMITTED HE RECENTLY

SENT GUATEMALA TO ORGANIZE GUERRILLA AREA BUT SA ID HE UNABLE ACCOM-

PLISH HIS TASK DUE STUPIDITY FAR REPS. OROZCO DEMANDED TO KNOW

SOURCE LIRING-3 INFORMATION. WHEN LIRING-3 REFUSED SAYING ONLY HE

IN CONTACT WITH FAR, OROZCO SAID *"IT MUST HAVE BEEN ROBERTO"*. HE

WENT ON TO THROW INSULIS ON CESAR MONTES AND OTHER FAR REPS (MENTION-

ING WAR NAMES) SAYING THAT DAVID CASSASOLA WHO WITH HIM IN GUATEMALA

WAS UNDISCIPLINED AND RESPONSIBLE FOR CAPTURE OF MANYOF THIS MEN AND

PROBABLY HIS OWN. OROZCO CLAIMED HE ONLY TRUE GUAT REVOLUTIONARY

AND ADMITTED HE HAD HOPED ENLIST LIRING-3'S HELP IN OBTAINING ARMS

WITH WHICH HE HOPED REARM FAR FOLLOWERS LOYAL TO HIM AND FORM OWN

BEVOLUTIONARY GROUP. OROZCO WAS GIVEN LIRING-3'S PHONE NUMBER BY

PAGE TWO MEXICO CITY 2331 SECRET

VALDEZ WHEN LATTER RECOMMENDED TO OROZCO AS FAR MEMBER BY ALBERTO
DOMINGO OF REVIEW POLITICA THOUGHT OROZCO WOULD BE GOOD CHANNEL TO
GUAT GUERRILLAS. VALDEZ BECAME VERY ANGRY DURING ABOVE CONFRONTA-
TION, CALLED OROZCO A TRAITOR AND THREATENED TO KILL HIM. OROZCO
BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT CLEARLY INDICATED HE VERY MUCH AFRAID FAR
GUNNING FOR HIM.

2. AT 0403, VALDEZ, MORENO AND LIRING-3 DEPARTED, BUT OROZCO
   APPARENTLY TERRORIZED REFUSED LEAVE LIRING-3'S APARTMENT BUT
   PROMISED HAVE NEW DISCUSSION AT 1000 HOURS. LIRING-3, AFRAID OROZCO
   MIGHT COMMIT SUICIDE HIS APARTMENT TRIED REENTER HIS PLACE A LITTLE
   LATER BUT FOUND OROZCO UNWILLING OPEN UP. LIRING-3 AND VALDEZ THEN
   SPENT REST OF NIGHT IN FRONT LIRING-3'S APARTMENT TO MAKE SURE
   OROZCO "WOULD NOT ESCAPE". AT ROWTON SUGGESTION, LIRING-3 HIRED
   A TAXI WHICH WAITED NEARBY. BETWEEN 0800 AND 0900 1 AUG OROZCO LEFT
   LIRING-3'S APARTMENT AND WENT TO HIS MOTHER'S ADDRESS FOLLOWED BY
   LIRING-3 AND VALDEZ IN TAXI.

3. AFTER REVIEWING ABOVE CASE STATION DECIDED CALL LITEMPO'S
   AND HAVE THEM PLACE OROZCO UNDER ARREST. STATION FELT LITEMPOS COULD

WAIT ANYLONGER RETURNED TO LIRING-3'S APARTMENT BEFORE ARRIVAL OF
LITEMPO 'S WHO TOOK OROZCO IN CUSTODY. LIRING-3 WAS THEN IN-
STRUCTED ATTEMPT MAKE URGENT CONTACT WITH FAR TO FINGER OROZ CO VIA
JACOBO PADILLA (WHO FIRST INTRODUCED LIRING-3 TO FAR). LIRING-3
NATURALLY NOI TOLDOF OROZCO'S ARREST BYLITEMPOS. STATION DOES NOT
BELIEVE OROZCO'S ARREST WILL JEOPARDIZE FUTURE LIRING-3 OP.

4. ALTHOUGH LITEMPO'S FOUND OROZCO'S PAPERS IN ORDER ARTICLE
   33 OFMEXICAN CONSTITUTION ALLOWS DEPORTATION OF FOREIGNERS WHOSE
   POESENCE IN MEXICO IS DECIMACLE。
   THUS IF GUAT GOVT INSTRUCTED it's
   AMBASSADOR IN MEXICO CITY TO PRESS CHARGES AGAINST OROZCO AS DANGEROUS
   REVOLUTIONARY AND ASK FOR HIS RETURN FOR TRIAL, LITENPOS WOULD VERY
   PROBABLY QUIETLY TURN OROZCO OVER TO GUATS. WOFACT WOULD THEN HOPE-
   FULLY HAVE OPPORTUNITY INTERROGATE OROZCO AT LENGTH ON HIS PECENT
   GUERRILLA ACTIVITIES IN GUAT. JUDGING FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE GUATS
   WOULD PROBABLY QUIETLY DO AWAY WITH OROZCO AFTER INTERROGATION.

5. IN VIEW OF ABOVE RECOMMEND GUAT STATION CONTACT LIAISON
   IMMEDIATELY AND TAKE STEPS HAVE OROZCO TURNED OVER TO GUAT REPS
   AND TAKEN TO GUATEMALA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO FACE REVOLUTIONARY

ANY EVENT, IF HE CAN BE DRAWN INTO CONVERSATION RO-TO
COULD TAILOR PITCH TO REACTION AND MAKE CLEAR TO JOERIN
THAT IT TO HIS BEST INTEREST LISTEN TO AND COOPERATE WITH ROUTON.

E. MAKE PITCH TO JULIAN LOPEZ DIAZ, WHEN
QUERIED IN NOV 65 AS TO *WHO* WOULD GO AFTER IF HAD TO CHOOSE ONE EMBASSY STAFFER, [LIONISH-1] PICKED OUT LOPEZ. ASKED TO ELABORATE ON REASONS, HE EXPLAINED
LOPEZ APPEARS LIKE BETTER THINGS OF LIFE, QUICKLY PUT EMBASSY CADILLAC INTO USE AFTER HE ARRIVED IN MEXI, DRESSES WELL, GIVES IMPRESSION OF WISHING TO BE "GRAN SENOR." ON 22 MAR, IN LIGHT OF CASTRO BRITANICAL PURGE, [LITA/L-7](2-101663) WAS ASKED WHO SHE FELT WAS MOST DEVOTED TO "DOLCE VITA" AMONG EMBASSY STAFFERS. SHE PICKED JULIAN LOPEZ FOR SAME REASONS SET FORTH EARLIER AND INDEPENDENTLY BY LIONISH-1. STATION HAS NOT YET FORMULATED PLANS FOR METHOD OF APPROACHING LOPEZ.

WATCHED BY SECURITY PEOPLE, ETC. EXPANDED VERSION WOULD
BUILD ON ACTUAL STATEMENTS OF WIFE TO INCLUDE SIMILAR
STATEMENTS SUPPOSEDLY MADE BY HERNANDEZ HIMSELF IN SECRET
MEETINGS WITH LICCO IN SEPT 64. THESE PURPORTED STATE-
MENTS WOULD HAVE HERNANDEZ DISILLUSIONED "OLD COMMUNIST,"
STILL ESSENTIALLY FAITHFUL TO MARXIST THEORY BUT DISMAYED
AT CASTRO COMMUNISM IN PRACTICE. IN ADDITION TO BEING
VIRTUAL PRISONER, UNDER EVER WATCHFUL EYE OF SECURITY
PERSONNEL, WOULD HAVE HIM ADMIT SADLY TO LICLOD THAT HE
ALSO PRISONER IN SENSE THAT ALTHOUGH HE DISILLUSIONED HE
FINDS SELF LOCKED UP TO AS ONE OF FOREMOST APOSTLES OF
COMMUNISM IN MEXI BY MEXI COMMUNISTS SUCH AS RECTOR

INDIVIDUAL. EXPLAIN THAT WHILE IN MEXI IN SEPT 64 HAD
CONTACTS WITH HERNANDEZ AND WIFE BUT BOTH MADE HIM SWEAR
NEVER TO REVEAL WHAT THEY TOLD HIM. NOW REALIZES IS
BREAKING PLEDGE TO WELL-MEANING FRIENDS BUT IN VIEW OF
RECENT TURN OF EVENTS IN CUBA FEELS MUST TELL WHAT HE

TELLING HERNANDEZ OF PLAN ASKING HIS FORGIVENESS FOR
BREAKING CONFIDENCE BUT IMPLORING HIM TO UNDERSTAND
LICLOD HIGH MOTIVES. WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE HIM MAIL SUCH A
LETTER. BELIEVE LICLOD, PROPERLY REHEARSED, AND USING HIS
EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF HERNANDEZ BACKGROUND (SEE MEXI 2752

Acting Chief of Station, Mexico City

RECT LITAMIL-7

Subject's Station file has just been reviewed for purging, and it was noted that his OA is still active and no final dispatch has been written closing this file, even though we are no longer in contact with Subject. Since Gerald D. FAHLANGER was the last Case Officer in contact with LITAMIL-7, it is requested that Headquarters have FAHLANGER (now assigned Headquarters) prepare a memorandum describing his last relationship with LIFAMIL-7 and requesting that his OA be cancelled and file be closed. The Station plans no further contact with LITAMIL-7. Contact was dropped with LITAMIL-7 by mutual consent; he was not a paid agent and was not anxious to play an aggressive role against the PBRUMEN target. See MEXICO CITY 4955 of 26 March 1969.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: LITAMIL-7

1.  According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER. LITAMIL-7. who is a female, was a secretary in the Mexico City PBRUMAN Embassy for more than 30 years. She was originally recruited by former Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Although Subject was never a very productive asset, she did provide information on activities of the installation and individuals working therein. In approximately 1969-70, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy, ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss of access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with the personnel, including the ambassador. For this reason the Station maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly upon retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty to them. This was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when she was working in the embassy.

2.  Subject met FAHLANGER, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx- imately six times in her home. The last time she was told that in view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the embassy, our relations with her would be termina ed. However, if she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work part or full time, we would, of course, consider contact again. This, of course, never happened.

3.  While Subject was not paid a regular salary, she did receive spot payments for the information she submitted. She also received occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday. The

E. LITAMIL-7: LITANIL-7, the Station's cely 201-330173
physical penetration of LIRING, was finally retired
by LIRING. This had been in the wind for some time.
The problem was that according to Mexican laws
I.TRING had to pay a salary for
every year worked, and she had worked for LIRING 38
years. She was notified on 28 March that on
instructions from the Foreign Ministry her employment
with LIRING was being terminated effective 31 March
1968. On 28 March, all her phone books, keys, et
cetera vere takea avay, and her appearance on
29 Earch vas a mere formality. Her termination pay

($6,000 U.S.) is being given in three installments,
with the last one the end of April. LITANIL-7 gavo
her Case Officer no advance notice of her release,
probably for fear of compromising her retirement
benefits. Station will, however, continue to main-
tain casual contact with her after she receives the
last installment of her severance pay. She may be
of help in the future in identifying LIRING visitors
or newcomers. Now that LITAMIL-7 is gone, the Statica
plans to activate LISAMPAN/CHARLIE, which, it is
hoped, will become a regular source of information
on LIRING.

Action Required: FYI

Reference: MEXICO CITY-5139, 5 April 1968

Summary: During the period of this report, LITAMIL-7 was met on a weekly basis. Most of the meetings with LITAMIL-7 were conducted in the presence of LITAMIL-3, who has known The into reporting information on the daily LIRING activities. Unfortunately, LITAMIL-7 has reported only routine information, much of which the Station already obtained through other means. In many cases, however, her information served to support information the Station suspected or needed to confirm. The following were factors that contributed to LITAMIL-7's apathy and reluctance to collect and report information of value. First, there was the problem of her health. Although she did have high blood pressure, most of her preoccupation over this condition was psychosomatic. It appeared that it provided her with a crutch to justify her inability to service Station requirements. Second, and this was probably the most significant factor behind her reluctance to collaborate fully, she was aware of the LIRING attitude towards retention of foreiga employees is that office. in January 1998, LIRING released all local employees except LITAMIL-7, and as the months vent by it became increasingly evident that it was only a matter of time before she would be released also.

SECRET ZMMA - 34598

Imminent termination was given by the fact that she was given less duties as the months passed, until at the very end she did little more than put in her time. with the spectre of unemployment looming over the horizon, LITAMIL-7 was reluctant to take any risk that might have compromised ner situation at LIRING. At stake was a sizable termination payment which the PBRUMKNers vere obligated to pay her according to local employment regulations. Obviously, she would do nothing to jeopardize this payment, which amounted to approximately $6,000 (U.S.). A further deterrent to her collaboration with the Station, even after her release by LIBING on 31 March, was the LIRING arrangement to make the termination payment in three increments, the last to be made at the end of April 1968. In view of this latest development in this operation, the Station has terminated the weekly meetings between the Station Case Officer and LITAMIL-7.

1. Introduction: During the period covered by this report, LITAMIL-7 was met and debriefed on a weekly basis. Her information was very limited and usually dealt with internal activities of a routine nature in LIRING. As pointed out above, her suervisors isolate mer som all our LIC BUGL suutine administrative duties. Consequently, she lost access to virtually everything that may have been of interest to the Station. The Station asked her to bring out the book of addresses and telephone numbers which she had compiled over the years, but she refused for fear that it would be missed Curing the afternoon when she was not on Guty. The Station then asked that she begin to copy the contents of the book a few pages each day. She agreed, but before she began this process the book disappeared, and all efforts to find it failed. She then began to compile a new book of addresses and telephone numbers, which she intended to bring out, but one of the LIRING officers asked for it on the day she was fired. In the end, the sum total of LITAMIL-7 LIRING information during the first three months of 1968 vas the identification of several photographs of LIRING employees, the tentative identification of offices and rooms in LIRING (tentative because she had not been in the second floor area since 1961, thus much of the identification was from memory), and finally, LITAMIL-7 confirmed telephone numbers assigned to specific LIRING personnel and furnished telephone numbers of individuals and companies servicing LIRING maintenance requirements (dry cleaners, pharmacy, typewriter repairmen, etc.). LITAMIL-7 volunteered to provide additional information on LIRING to the Station provided it was within her capability, and after she received her final severance payment from LIRING.

2. Finance: LITAMIL-7 received no salary and no ternina- tion bonus from the Station.

3. Security: Since all contact with LITANIL-7 was maintained through LITAMIL-3, LITAMIL-7 does not have a Station telephone number. She does not know the true names of any of the Station Case Officers who handled her. All meetings with her were held in her home, thus no safehouses were used, and she was never seen with Case Officers in public. She had no telephone, so no contacts were made with her by phone. From the security point of view, the LITAMIL-7 operation enjoyed a long life, January 1961 through March 1968. Taking into account her fear and apprehension, plus the fact that she maintained good relations with LITAMIL-3, this record is all the more remarkable. From the intelligence point of view, it is unfortunate that her production was so zinizal.

HYMA - 34598

4. Future of the Operation: Although for all intents and purposes the LITAMIL-7 operation has come to an end, the Station intends to maintain a casual contact with her. It is very likely that she may know new personnel assigned to LIRING and may be able to furnish information on these individuals. There may also be developments in LIRING which, on the basis of her lengthy service in LIRING, she might be able to assess and clarify. Since LITAMIL-7 vas not a salaried agent for the Station, the operation cost nothing more than the investment of Case Officer time, and an occasional gift of flowers. In view of her intense pride, there is little reason to believe that she will accept money in the future. If she is able to provide information to the Station it will probably be done without any thought of compensation.

into LIRING during the period immediately after the publicized death of "Che" Guevara and the roll-up of the commo system of the revolutionaries in Bolivia. They were especially useful in monitoring the reaction of LIRING-2 who was very closely tied to this commo net and against whom the Station was planning an operation.

C. Through LITAINT-2, two denigation leaflets were produced attacking the LIRING staff in Mexico. One on the LIRING representative in Veracruz produced a reaction in the form of a reward being offered for the apprehension of the perpetrators of this material.

She furnished interesting information on the goings-on at LIRING at the time of the AERON crash including the presence of General Lazaro CARDENAS. Later the same month, she obtained from one of the LIRING officers propaganda records produced by the Cultural Ministry which she lent us for copying. She was the first to report that a former LIRING intelligence officer had gained a high level position in the PERUVIAN Ministry of Culture.

Chief of Station, Mexico City

SUBJECT:

O PBRUMEN/LIRAVINE/Procurement of Certificate of Papal Blessing for LITAMIL-7

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

1.  LITAMIL-7, an aging spinster, is a penetration agent of the Mexico Station inside the PBRUMEN Embassy. She has recently been seriously ill on two occasions and has been shabbily treated by her employers while the Station has lavished attention on her. As a result of this contrast in demonstrated concern for her wellbeing, LITAMIL-7 has shown a determination to be of much more active service to the Station than in the past.

2.  LITAMIL-7 is a devout and practicing Roman Catholic. To do the Gracimle understanding that certificates of Papal blessing can be obtained without too much difficulty in Rome. If this is the case, and the Rome Station can securely obtain such a certificate, it is believed that its presentation to her would cinch her already demonstrated determination to help the Station with its anti-AMTHUG work.

3.  A blessing of LITAMIL-7's home or prayer for her continued health or any other appropriate form of certificate would be much appreciated. Please T/A any costs to the Mexico Station. LITAMIL-7's identity follows by separate cover attachment.

This report was not disseminated. Information marginal, no intel value to customers.

Ng notes that the station has apparently raised LIIL-7 from F to B. We feel that a more proper evaluation for this source (from whose little of disseminable value has been received) would be C. If in the future her reporting warrants further upgrading to B, the station should at that time make a recommendation.

Sbe info from an arcs is concicered to be quite low-lovel and fragantary. Snclosing for dotails.

After this careful review, ve fail to find any Justification for raising her to a 2 ve wish to point out that source's car to information does not affect her rating. That would be re louted in the appraisal of content. LI-ANIL-7 is considered a ** source by Acadquarters.

Re HMM 7251. Supdata.

The complete production of LIFANIL-7 has been reviewed by Headquarters. Of the 10 reports submitted from September 1962 through Fay 1963, of which 1-7 was the source of the complete, or a specific part of the report, 5 were not disseminated. In addition to those which were disseminatea, & assess used aaro received in ops casies vnien was 120.

The info fron this source is considered to be quite low-level and fragmentary, including few details.

After this careful review, we fail to find any justification for raising her to a "Be.

he wish to point out that source's access to information does not affect her rating. That would be relected in the appraisal of content.

LITANIL-7 is considered a "C" source by Headquarters.

# Summary

## LITAMIL-7

Field has submitted a total of 11 reports, of which 9 LITAMIL-7 was given as source for all, or a specific part of the report. 1 she was outsource, and in she was one of 6 sources and her contribution not specified. Plus that, info from was taken from 2 Ops cables for use in dissem.

Of the 11, 5 were 20 DISSEM. (one still on my desk, probably no dissem.)

RE The info submitted by her is all pretty low level. Matter of fact, pretty much what would be considered overt in any normal embassy or consulate. She obviously not matters to come to our attention, but no indication she makes any effort to fill in the fragmentary info she submits.

I just can't see why the field considers her a B (except that they seem to consider all their sources a A.). It will be used that they considered her a A from the very moment they ever submitted from her. If they have justification for raising her, why don't they spell it out.

If this low-level informant is considered a B reporting agent - maybe we better devise some super evals for the GOOD sources.

Needless to say, I think C is very generous.

I doubt whether the AO or JO in lexi ever evaluated her stuff.

Now - what is your opinion, Wayne? If you think she XXXXXX is worth a B, its certainly OK by me (it probably would be the easy way out). However, looking at the over-all, seems wrong to give her a B unless she really deserves it -

to determine. I don't think they even have a source card in her -
at least not one giving her a "B" - that's certain.

Perhaps the field's argument in the supdate swayed them. It said,
"Source LIAA II-7 who station officially considers 3 source. Most
info submitted by L-7 is obtained directly from Cuban Embassy
records. In present case L-7 personally read cable rec'd in data."

That still doesn't qualify her for a B - that would up the

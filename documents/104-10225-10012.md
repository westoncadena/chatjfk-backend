LX 4629

<8. Miguel Angel DIAZ Isalque: I showed P the letter from DIAZ to the PO Box 982 Coral Gables box; F said he did not know that address and had no idea how DIAZ might have got it. I told P it was a sensitive address which we did not want to have blown, asked him to contact DIAZ, ostensibly because KALBING (who long ago was having P prime DIAZ for a trip to Madrid, which never came off) had sent regards and an explanation of why the "adrid thing fell thru) P is to make no mention of the Coral Gables address or the letter, but assuming DIAZ will bring it up, to try to discover how DIAZ got that address, while also discovering what it is DIAZ had in mind when he wrote the letter. P thinks he has DIAZ' phone number, if necessary can use the ploy of having seen DIAZ' TV ad for his furniture store.>

SUBJECT: Contact Report on Miguel TAI Izalque. (D)

1. (Back ground). (D) was an agent of ours during the early/mid 1960s and put his life on the line many times for us in different assignments. In c. Dec 1963, he was examined and approved by INS to become an American citizen. He paid the $325.00 Court fee and expected to be called shortly thereafter for the Naturalization Court ceremony. To date, he has not been Naturalized and INS has refused - according to (ct - to satisfactorily explain the reason for this unusual delay. (D asked us in c. February 1975 to help determine the cause for the INS delay. This came back saying he should make one more attempt with INS before this would check with her: INS liaison.)

2. On 21 and 27 March, I met with (D) and informed him of the His suggestion that he check once again with INS. (D) informs me he went back to INS and has been given the same evasive/vague explanation: "Your case is under investigation. We'll call you when its finished.". (or words to that effect.)

3. (D)has extensive business relations in both Costa Rica and Venezuela. He desparately needs a US passport to travel freely.

4. As far as I know, (D) has been a loyal/daring agent who has always been ready to cooperate (and still does). If we possibly can -consistent with current policy- offer a hand to this man, at this time, we will be creating a great amount of goodwill with (D). God know we need to hang on to as many good and old friends as we can.

5. IF -for some reason- D's case with INS is murky, and he is ineligible to be an ANCIT, then we should know that, too.

6. Before beating this dead horse any further, let me sum up. If its a bureaucratic snafu by INS, lets help (D) If, on the other hand, INS has legitimate case against (D) lets find out the details for the sake of our security.

7. I promised/to pass the word to our people up North and hopefully have some word on the status of his case soon.

Henry S. PACHANKIS.

# Contact Report on Hiquel Diaz Isalque.

1.  Kiquel was mot for lunch at the Marriott Hotel on 12 February, to ascertain why he wanted to see me and how he came into possession of the sensitive office accommodation address.

2.  Getting hold of Miguel was difficult and had to be done in a roundabout way. I could not tip my hand and admit I had received his letter. I had to write to his home address and enclose a stamped, self addressed envelope to my new PO Box.

3.  As always, our meeting was most pleasant and comfortable. Our association goes back many years and I have always had the greatest respect for his talents and motivation.

4.  Kiquel stated he had been trying to reach me and thought he could do it through:

Orlando Orizon Casas

1613 NW 14th Court

Ft. Lauderdale, Fla
tel: 703-1346.

Orlando worked inside for the organization in the 1960s, had been imprisoned and finally released in c. 1970. I had debriefed him at that time and serviced some other requests he had to make to the Organization in subsequent months. Orlando's wife and Miguel's wife are related. Orlando
had been receiving Organization assistance while he was in prison and evidently received her funds through the reference PO Box. Riquel wanted to get in touch with me and asked orlando if he had a way of communicating with the organization. Orlando then supplied Siquel with the Po Box.

5.  I did not press Figuel for any further details. I believe this answers most of our questions. I denied having received Eiquel's letter and Riquel reasoned that it was "probably one of those old addresses which isn't i use anymore."

6.  Miguel's interest in sening me was for the following:

A. On 25 October 1973, he was interviewed by INS for his US citizen's application, and reapplied at the US District Court in Miami. He has never again been called back. This is usually a routine, fast process.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 8

8. Miguel has been to INS in Miami on several occasions to inquire to the delay in giving him (and his wife and daughter) their US citizenship. He has always been told that "nothing is wrong" and that he will be called soon. But over a year's wait is not normal and something must be wrong.

9. In view of Miguel's past relationship with us he wonders if this is holding up his citizenship. He asks us to inquire with the responsible authorities and let him know the present status of the case.

10. Would the Office please contact INS so we can assist Miguel in some way and find out why he has not been called to take his citizen's oath? Thanks in advance.

5. The details are:

Miquel DIAZ Isalgue A 11 264 049
Has US District Court receipt # 82427, dated Oct 25, 1973 for $25.00.

wife: Fabiola Fura DE LA PORTILLA de DIAZ A 12 445 501
Has US District Court receipt under the name of Fabiola Fura DIAZ, # 82426, date 25 Oct 1973, for $ 25.00.

daughter: Maria Rosa DIAZ A 12 445 502.

7. Operationally, Miquel is always ready and willing to cooperate and collaborate. When I was last asked to contact Miquel over a year ago he was asked if he would be available to re-contact CLPCZ-1 in Madrid. Although his answer was in the affirmative, there was never any followup.

8. Miguel now has business ventures in both Costa Rica and Venezuela. He claims to have well placed frienis in the Costa Rican government. He has recently began importing appliances into Venezuela. His contact there is: 201-07566656

Antonio BUSTILLO (mit unknown) Caucasian male. DOB: c. 1931 in Guantanamo, oriente, Cuba.

BUSTILLO is the "right hand man" of Venezuelan Minister, and confidant of Carlos Andres PEREZ: 201-0104034

Orlando GARCIA (mit unknown) Caucasian male. DOB: c. 1924 in Havana, Cuba.

9. Miguel led me to understand that he is available in whatever task we might need him. I have promised to pass this on to the office. I have just scratched the surface not knowing


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 9

what interest, if any, the office has. Put, with the impending re-establishment of God diplomatic relations with both Costa Rica and Venezuela, Rigel might be useful to us in developing access dents to the new Cuban mission versonnel, or any other assignment we might roufre along these lines. Please advise.

17. I promised Miquel that I would pass on his remment to the office and get back to him just as soon as i had some answer.

PS: For the record: Miquel is not looking for a job. He appears affluent and quite busy with his business ventures. But, fam almost certain he would contribute his services for the cause, if we need him, with complete dedication.

Henry S. PACHANKIS.

REF MADRID 17403/(IN730839)

1. THROUGH QUEYE SURVEILLANCE IT WAS DETERMINED ON 16 OCTOBER THAT AMWOLF/! LEFT THE CONSULATE ALONE AND WENT TO HIS APARTMENT. ON THE BASIS OF THIS ALERT, POSITIONED ANCHALK/5 NEAR GARAGE WHERE AMWOLF/1 PARYS HIS CAR.

2. AT 1656 HOURS 16 OCTOBER WHEN AMWOLF/1 LEFT THE GARAGE, AMCHALY/5 WAS ABLE TO STOP HIM HALF A BLOCK FROM HIS APARTMENT AND CARRIED ON A SIX MINUTE CONVERSATION. INITIALLY AMWOLF/1 WAS COLD, VISUALLY UPSET BUT LATER BECAME JOVIAL. AT FIRST INSISTED THAT AMCHALK/5 COME TO THE CONSULATE OR CALL HIM TO SET UP MEETING. HOWEVER, ANCHALK/5 INSISTED THEY TALK THEN AND AMWOLF/1 AGREED. AFTER AMCHALK/5 MADE THE PITCH, AMWOLF/I REACTED BY SAYING "THESE 'JOHNIES' HAVE EVERYTHING AND NOW THEY REALLY STEPPED ON ME". AMWOLF/1 ENDED THE CONVERSATION BY AGAIN AKSING AMCHALK/5 TO COME TO CONSULATE OR CALL HIM SO THEY COULD HAVE ANOTHER TALK. AMWOLF/1 RETURNED TO THE CAR WHERE HIS WIFE WAS WAITING AND STARTED THE MOTOR AND THEN STOPPED AGAIN AND GOT OUT. HE THEN HAD AMCHALK/5 COME OVER AND INTRODUCED HIS

WIFE TELLING HER THAT HE HAD JUST BEEN PITCHED ON BEHALF OF

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH WHAT HAPPENED.

3. ANCHALK/5 COMMENTED TO CASE OFFICER THAT HE DID NOT THINK
   AMWOLF/1 WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALK/5 BELIEVES WE SHOULD
   WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER
   MEETING OR TELEPHONE CALL. STATION AGREES WE SHOULD WAIT A FEW
   DAYS BUT THAT A TELEPHONE CALL SHOULD PRECEDE ANY MEETING. IF THE
   TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES A CONTINUED NEGATIVE REACTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED
   WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HQS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE
   WILL GET SOME REACTION FROM QUTINID IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
   ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT AFTER THE ENCOUNTER, AMWOLF/1 WENT TO THE
   EMBASSY BUT DID NOT REMAIN. SURVEILLANCE WAS NOT ABLE TO LOCATE
   HIM AT THE CONSULATE.

1.  I met AMCHALK-5 at the airport and spent three hours with him between flights. I passed him the note from C/COG for delivery to his contact in Madrid station. This note confirmed what I told AMCHALK-5 orally concerning the amount of money that could be offered AMWOLF-1 for his defection er recruitment.

2.  I briefed AMCHALK-5 on the contact arrangements and operational plan proposed by Madrid. AMCHALK-5 is still confident that he will have success in his contact with AMWOLF-1.

MEMORANDUM FORE Record

SUBJECT : Meeting with AMCHALK-5

TIME AND PLACE: Miami, 3 and 4 OCTOBER

1. I met AMCHALK-5 at 1430 hours at the Rusty Pelican Restuarant. I told him we would like to have him travel immediatoly in order to arrive in Madrid by 9 October. ANCHALK-5 said he could make it with no problem. He wasn't sure his wife would be able to go on such short notice, but that didn't matter. I briefed him on the contact arrangements sent from Madrid and described WIBALDA to him. I told him WIBALDA'S name is "ROBERTO." AMCHALK-5 said he would make the 0330 hours contact on 10 October, but of course if something goes wrong that he will go to all the alternate meetings. He will be wearing a white sports jacket, white shirt, blue tie, blue slacks and black shoes.

2. I told AMCHALK-5 that WIBALDA would have the letter for AMGHOST-1 for hia to take to the meeting, and I told him again not to use the letter unless his recruitmont pitch had no results. If he does pass the letter, I suggested that he flex it to prove to AMWOLF-1 that it does not contain a bomb.

3. I told AMCHALK-5 that it looked good for a surprige contact with AMWOLF-1 on 10 October and because ho would be going to lunch with a woman not connected with his offico. AMCHALK-5 was pleased to hear this sesa because he feels he must make the contact unannounced for it to be effective. He said that if the October 10 contact was missed, there would probably be another luncheon the following week. AMCHALK-5 is willing to stay in Madrid as long as nесеввагу..

4. AMCHALK-5 was sorry to hear that I won't be going to Madrid because he wants to be sure that he is given as much flexibility as possible, and not forced to handle the approach in a manner that he would not be comfortable with. I told him

![signature of AMCHALK-S]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 26

-2-

that IBALDA understood the situation, and that I was sure it would all go well. AMCHALK-5 assured me that he has no intention of letting himself get into a physically dangerous situation during the contact.

5. If the contact is made next wook, AMCHALK-5 will be back before the PACHANKIS is. I said we would want to debrief his in Miami and that either I would see him or PACHANKIS would. I said that if, PACHANKIS talks to him, he can tell PACILANKIS the congleto details of the operation unless I phoned him otherwise.

6. We arranged to meet again at 1900 hours when AMCHALK-5 wogld have his itinerary, and I could pass him the money he needed. AMCHALK-5 doesn't want to be paid for this job, but I insisted again that we would pay all his expenses, and I told him to save his totel bill and other receipts. We met at 1900 hours at the Vizcaya bar and then drove around in AMCHALK-5's car. I passed hia 81,500 for which he signed a receipt. AMCHALK-5 had gotten reservations and will leave Miami for New York on 7 October and - thes fly to Lisbon that same night. He will spend 8 and 9 October in Lisbon where he will rent a car and drive to Madrid, arriving in the evening on 9. October. He has reservations in the Agumar Hotel for 9 October, and he will make the first contact at 0930 hours on 10 October.

7. I wished ANCHALK-5 good luck. He is much more optomistic about his chances with AMWOLF-1 than I am, but it is good to work with a man with enthusiaam. Just in case AMCHALK-5 should be successful, we should be prepared to support him. I suggest that ve cacie Madrid telling them what and how much we are willing to offer should AMWOLF-1 be interested in defecting. I told AMCHALK-5 that he could promise asylum, but I did not tell him how much money he could offer as an inducement for either recruitment in place or defection.

that WIBALDA understood the situation, and that I was sure it

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, TH/COS

FROM : Thomas k. Keogh, Jr.

SUBJECT : Proposal to Continue fttempt to Establish Channel/Dialogue With AMGHOST-1 (201-810126)

1. As a follow-up Measure to our attempt to establish a chennel to ANGHOST-1 by using 1-2 on 10 August in Montreal, I propose that we establich an operation with the same end; on this occasion, however, I propose that at this stage we use AMOLF-1 a cur secure channel to AMGHOST-1.

2. The dramatis perrerae in this operation are: (a) ANCHALK-5 (201-30737, reliable, or asset has been involved with, and and who kno AIGHOST-1; and (b) AMWOLF-1, Deputy Chief of Center, Cuban Intelligence Services (CUYS), Madrid,

3. Timing of this operation would be for that period in September in which ACHALK-5 visits Europe,

4. The place for the meeting between AMCHALK-S and ARAOL would be in Madrid, Spain, at a place mutually convenient to both. The meeting would be established either by telephone or by personal contact.

5. The purpose of this operation is to establish a channel of communications/dialogue with ANGHOST-1.

6. This operation involves ANCHALK-5's passing of a sealed envelope with a messare in it for MOLE-1's unopened transmittal to AMGHOST-1. ANCHALK-5's instructions would be to pass the sealed and unopened communication to AMACLF-1. ANCHALK-5 would then tell LF-1 that the message must be transmitted directly without tampering or being opened to ANGHOST-1. ANCHALK-5 would add that HOST-1 is waiting for this communication. AYI: Director 149293, dated 13 June 1971, paragraph 2 noted 'that A'WOLF-1 was contact man in DGI effort recruit AMCHALK-5 in June 1967."

"SEGRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 34

7. The message to AMCHALK-5 follows:

M.

We arranged to meet "PUSHKIN" recently but you apparently called the meeting off. We can understand your hesitancy to meet with us in that place and at that time. We do, however, wish to meet with you anytime, any place of mutual agreement via any secure channel of your personal confidence. As you can see, in this instance, we have selected an officer whose loyalty to you is unquestioned. We intended to tell "PUSHKIN" of possible pitfalls in your path. We still wish you to know of these dangers. We realize that you are a true revolutionary in every sense of the word. We have no quarrel with you as a true revolutionary nor with the system that has established itself over the years. We will not countenance nor do we believe that you will countenance continued foreign intervention in your system wherein lies the major danger to your futre. We would also like to make you an offer which would be difficult for you to refuse. To contact one of our reliable officers concerning this opening of a two-way channel of communications, contact or have your selected man contact DIAZ in which you showed some interest in 1967 and he will then contact us. He will then relay the time and meeting date to us, and we will then open our dialogue using only trusted personnel.

Greetings,

L.

8. I believe that our chances for success in this operation are reasonably good for the following reasons:
   (a) ANCHALK-5 is sufficiently courageous to meet AMWOLF-1 in the Cuban Ambassador's office in Madrid, if necessary;
   (b) AMWOLF-1 is a trusted colleague and follower of AMGHOST-1. For this reason and in the belief that ANGHOST-1 was awaiting the message, he would find a way to deliver the message unopened to AMGHOST-1; (c) AMGHOST-1 from all available reporting, background material, SI traffic, we have reason to believe that AMGHOST-1 is not held in the confidence of the Soviets nor does he respect their presence in Cuba, a presence which can only be interpreted as promising difficulties for ANGHOST-1; and (d) Bona fides for the originator are contained in a copy of a letter from AMGHOST-2 to her relatives which she signs with the name "PUSHKIN."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 35

9. I request authorization to commence this operation immediately with appropriate alterations as required.

IT WAS NOT ANTICIPATED THAT SUCH CONTACT WOULD BE MADE PRIOR TO LATE DECEMBER AND POSSIBLY NOT UNTIL JANUARY 1970, SINCE THE RELEASE OF FERNANDO ROJAS BY FIDEL CASTRO WAS A CONTINGENT FACTOR. AS FAR AS WE KNOW ROJAS HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HOWEVER WHICH MAY MEAN THE RELEASE IS IN PROCESS. ROJAS'S WIFE WHO LIVES IN MACON, GEORGIA, RECEIVED A LETTER WRITTEN BY ROJAS AND DATED 19 DECEMBER. ROJAS SAID IN HIS LETTER THAT HE HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER PRISON FROM LA CABANA AND THAT HE AND OTHER PRISONERS WERE DEALING WITH A DELEGATE FROM THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR CONCERNING VISITS BY CLOSE RELATIVES IN EXILE.

Dismissal of ANCHALK-5

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

Action Required: As indicated

References: A. WH/MIAMI 5683
B. UFGA-29702, 12 March 1968

1.  ANCHALK-5 was advised on 17 October 1969 that his services with RVROCK had not been in sufficient demand to justify his retention on the payroll beyond 30 November 1969. Accordingly, on 31 October 1969 AMCHALK-5 executed a termination secrecy oath and quitclaim which are forwarded as separate cover attachments hereto. The agent was paid his salary through 30 November plus a bonus equivalent to one month's salary.

2.  During the afternoon of 31 October 1969 and following the meeting that morning with AMCHALK-5 which was to have been the final meeting; AMCHALK-5 initiated contact with writer and advised that he had, upon returning to his office from the morning meeting, received a letter from Cuba. This letter was in response to one which he had sent to an old accommodation address. Reference A and subsequent correspondence describe the letter received by ANCHALK-5 and developments which followed. Although AMCHALK-5 was reimbursed for cost of his transportation to Canada and was paid per diem for the duration of his travel, he has collaborated with the Station since 30 November 1969 on a voluntary basis without compensation.

3.  Since severance of AMCHALK-5 from the Station payroll had been imminent for some time and he was not being used operationally, no request was submitted for renewal or up-dating

# TERMINATION SECRECY OAΤΗ

Miguel A. Diaz am about to terminate my association with Organization. I realize that, by virtue of my duties with the Organization, I have been the recipient of information and intelligence which concerns the present and future security of our country. I am aware that the unauthorized disclosure of such information is prohibited by the espionage laws of our government which specifically requires the protection of intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, I SOLEMNLY SWEAR, WITHOUT MENTAL RESERVATION OR PURPOSE OF EVASION, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF DURESS, AS FOLLOWS:

1.  I will never divulge, publish, or reveal by writing, word, conduct, or otherwise any information relating to the national defense and security and particularly information of this nature relating to intelligence sources, methods, personnel, fiscal data, or security measures to anyone, including.,. but not limited to, any future governmental or private employer, private citizen, or government employee or official without the express written consent of the Chief of the Organization or his authorized representative.

2.  I have been invited to submit in writing any monetary claims I may have against the Organization or our government, which may in any way necessitate the disclosure of information described herein. I have been advised that any such claims will receive full legal consideration. In the event, however.. that I am not satisfied with the decisions of the Organization concerning any present or future claims I may submit, I will not take any other action to obtain satisfaction without prior written notice to the Organization, and then only in accordance with such legal and security advice as the Organization will promptly furnish me.

3.  I do not have any documents or materials in my possession, classified or unclassified, which are the property of, or in custodial responsibility of the Organization, having come into my possession as a result of my duties with the Organization or otherwise.

4.  During my exit processing and during my period of employment with the Organization I have been given an opportunity to report all information about the Organization, its personnel, and its operations which I consider should receive official cognizance. Hence, I am not aware of any information which it is my duty, in the national interest, to disclose to the Organization, nor am I aware of any violations or breaches of security which I have not officially reported, except as set forth on the reverse side of this sheet or on other attachments.

5.  I have been advised that, in the event I am called upon by the properly constituted authorities to testify or provide information which I am pledged hereby not to disclose, I will notify the Organization immediately; I will also advise said authorities of my secrecy commitments to our government and will request that my right or need to testify be established before I am required to do so.

6. I am aware of the provisions and penalties of the espionage laws of our government and am fully aware that any violation on my part of certain matters sworn to by me under this oath may subject me to prosecution under the terms of these laws, and that violation of other portions of this oath are subject to appropriate action, including such dissemination of the violation as the circumstances warrant.

I have read and understand the contents of this oath and volentarily affix my signature hereto with the full knowledge that this oath was executed for the mutual benefit of myself and our government, and that it will be retained in the files of the Organization for its future use or for reference by me at any time in the future that I may be requested or ordered to testify or disclose any of the matters included within the scope of this oath.

Operations Against AMROST Representatives in Canada

Reference: A. UFAN 671, 1 December 1969
B. UFAN 673, 1 December 1969

1. After his return to Ottawa from Montreal for the ANCHALK/S -ANCHOS meeting, ZOLTAN had a number of extended discussions with SHADOVE Headquarters' officers on the general subject of operations atras AMROST in Montreal. They had one complaint about the ANCHAL/S meeting that we believe in logical and warranted on their part. At our request they had more or less reserved the services of their tee surveillance teams in Montreal to cover the ARCHALK/S operation. This was based on our early request which in turn was based on the Headquarters' called request that SHABOVE give as much coverage as possible to the meeting. When it turned out that it would be impractical to cover the meeting at all with surveillance, SHABOVE felt that they had "reserved" their team for nothing. As you may know, SHABOVE vas espect especially pressed during that period. The Grey Cup football goo -an event that corres to our love Lovl - was scheduled for the following weekend and they expected trouble from militant separatists, etc. In other words, they were not too happy that we asked for support and then did not use it.

2. Looking back over various records, we find that this situation is not entirely new. Wo do, however, want to avoid this in the future. In future cases we will have to reach a firנו decision on what we want SHABOVE to do for us voli before we go to them and ask for support. Once this support is essered, then we should follow through and use it. If not, SHABOVE vill soon stop offering to help us in this way. In order to get an operation such on this organized and presented to EMABOVE, we suggest that Headquarters make their views known well in advance. If a change is desired after the operation is launched as happened in the case of the ANCHALK75-ANGHOST Resting in Montreal, our liaison relation- ship with SALONS will surely suffer. We will watch this in the

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH

3. On a more hopeful note, the [missing] officers in Ottawa
   are enthusiastic about the possibilities of launching operations
   against the ANCHOR group in Montreal. [missing] explained that
   ROOKIE intended to worsen matters in the front room for agent
   contacts that could be of use in Montreal. They were
   especially interested in enabling what they have termed the
   low-level entry opportunity for JUMBO types in Montreal. This
   contact would be known to the ANCHOR representative as a [missing]
   person who could, if approached, aid them in defecting to
   [missing] Our present idea is that in the event you
   need to be in Montreal, [missing] paying a commercial office
   there and making periodic trips to check on it should be enough.
   In this way we would not have to turn the agent over to [missing]
   to handle. His contact with us could be via New York or Miami.
   We would, of course, have to keep [missing] completely informed
   on his travels in and out of Montreal, and any contact that he had
   with ANCHOR would have to be copied to them. As you know
   there is considerable travel between Miami and Montreal especially
   in the winter months and a suitable cover for an agent to open an
   office there should not pose too great a problem. We have noticed
   that orange juice is imported from the Miami area in (great
   quantities). Possibly a small office to do market research on
   this commodity could be used as a suitable cover. As it is now
   the ANCHOR representatives in Montreal would probably not know
   how to go about defecting. We recall that [missing] had problems
   in this regard before he finally decided to make his move.

4. SHADOVE said that they would like to see a simple
   provocation against ANCHOR in Montreal. They suggested that we
   select an agent to go there and simply walk into their office,
   explain that he is not satisfied with his lot in Miami, and ask
   for help. We are not sure where this would get us but it does
   show that SHADOVE is willing to entertain more aggressive ideas
   than we have given them credit for in the past.

5. We have for some time been attempting to pull our files
   together to determine just what we have in terms of ANCHOR
   representation in the country. This has been difficult since
   our files are not in good order. For this reason we are glad to
   learn, while KOLTER was visiting Headquarters on 12 December 1969,
   that the Headquarters desk is doing a study of ANCHOR and other
   PERU officers in EMADO. When this is received we would like to
   put it into a form of a target notebook. We will give this to
   SHADOVE and let them add what they can. With this start we
   should be able to jointly keep it up to date and complete.

6. We appreciate the references and will pass SHADOVE the
   material that is of interest to them.

MICROFILMED
[FC 4-1969
DOC. MICRO. SER.

1. ON 26 NOVEMBER NEDECKER AND OTTAWA STATION CASE OFFICER NOLTHAM MET WITH SMADOVE OFFICERS DON BATSTONE AND NORMAN CYR OF THE MONTREAL COUNTER-SUBVERSIVE SECTION. THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING ARRANGED BY NOLTHAM WAS TO BRIEF SMADOVE ON THE AMCHALK-5 OPERATION, DISCUSS THE CUBAN PROBLEM AS IT RELATED TO CANADA AND TO GENERAL ACQUAINT SMADOVE WITH WH/MIAMI INTERESTS. PRIOR TO MEETING WITH SMADOVE NEDECKER AND NOLTHAM AGREED THAT FRANKNESS WAS CALLED FOR AND THAT WITHIN SECURITY LIMITATIONS WE WOULD ATTEMPT TO ENGENDER INCREASED INTEREST ON THE PART OF SMADOVE FOR THE CUBAN TARGET.

2. THE OBVIOUS GOOD RAPPORT ESTABLISHED BY THE OTTAWA STATION HELPED IN ESTABLISHING A FREE AND EASY DISCUSSION. NEDECKER FULLY REVIEWED THE AMCHALK-5 CASE AND ALSO THE GENERAL PROBLEM OF WORKING AGAINST THE CUBAN TARGET EMPHASIZING OUR INTEREST IN INCREASE OPERATIONS AGAINST DSI PERSONNEL. WHILE THE SMADOVE OFFICERS EXHIBITED A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST IT WAS APPARENT THEY HAD LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TARGET. THEY DID ASK

SECACT RYBAT TELEPOUCH

PROFESSIONALLY PERTINENT QUESTIONS AN IMPRESSED DETECTOR
AS KNOWING THEIR BUSINESS. IN QUESTIONING THEM THEY 17-
VEALED THAT SMABOVE HAD FORTY TO FIFTY MEN IN THEIR COUNTER-
SUBVERSIVE SECTION IN MONTREAL BUT THAT ONLY TEN PERCENT OF
THEIR EFFORT WAS DIRECTED AT THE CUBAN TARGET. THIS WAS
STATED HESITATINGLY AND IT IS DOUBTED THAT THEY SPEND THAT
MUCH TIME ON THE TARGET. THEY DID ADMIT CONCERN AND DID
MENTION THEIR WORRY ABOUT CUBAN-QUEBEC NATIONALIST TIES.
NO SPECIFICS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS DISCUSSED. IT WAS
APPARENT FROM THE OUTSET THAT THEY BOWED TO HEADQUARTERS
IN OTTAWA IN DISCUSSING ANY OPERATIONS.

3. MR. CYR WAS CLEARLY THE PERSON MORE CONCERNED
   WITH THE CUBAN TARGET. HE TOOK NOLTHAM AND BEBECKER ON A
   TOUR OF CUBAN INSTALLATION SITES AND THE AREA WHICH ARAUZ
   HAD EXPLORED IN PREPARATION FOR HIS MEETING WITH ANCHALK-S.
   HE LATER EXHIBITED A HIGH DEGREE OF FRIENDLINESS AND TOOK
   US TO SMABOVE HEADQUARTERS FOR CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS AND
   DRINKS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE MEETINGS WITH CYR IN PARTI-
   CULAR WERE PROFITABLE AND THAT RVROCK COULD GET FURTHER
   COOPERATION OF AN OPERATIONAL NATURE IF SMABOVE HEADQUARTERS
   WOULD OPEN THE WAY FOR JOINT OPERATION IN MONTREAL. SINCE
   MONTREAL HAS PROBABLY THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF CUBAN
   OFFICIALS IN THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF HAVANA THE FIELD IS RIPE.

4. KEBECKER TOLD BOLTHAM THAT UPON HIS RETURN TO MIAMI
   HE WOULD LOOK FOR MIAMI AGENT OR ASSETS THAT HAS CONTACT
   IN CANADA AND WOULD WORK TOWARD THE OBJECTIVE OF FULMER.
   INTERESTING SMABOVE IN THE TARGET - A MOST TEMPTING ONE.
   IT WAS SUGGESTED IN THE INTERIM THAT PERHAPS COS, .1.A.A
   INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT ANEW WITH SMABOVE AND GET THEIR
   REACTION TO JOINT OPERATIONS AGAINST THE TARGET.

IT WAS ASR250 THAT REQUIREMENTS ON TO OTTAWA F DISCUSSION WITH SMACT.

6. NOLTHAM TOLD NEBECKER THAT THE NEWLY ARRIVED CEYLONESA AMBASSADOR TO OTTAWA WAS ALSO ACCREDITED 1 CUBA ANG THAT HE HAD COOPERATED IN THE PAST WITH AVROCK. AILE THE STATION IN UITANA HAD NOT YET RECONTACTED THE AMBASSADOR THEY WERE PLANNING TO DO SU IN THE FUTURE. A BRIEF CISCUSSION WAS HELD ON THE POSSIBLE UTILIZATION OF THIS PEREST. MOLTHAM WAS REQUESTED TO KEEP CUBA IN MIND DURING THE FORTHCOMING MEETINGS WITH THE CEYLONESE AND PARTICULARLY ANY INFORMATION REGARDING HIS TRAVEL TO CUBA. HE WAS TOLD THAT WHIYAMI WOULD LIKE TO MEET WITH HIM PRIOR TO ANY TRAVEL TO CUBA.

7. A COPY OF THIS MESSAGE AND THE REFERENCE IS BEING GIVEN TO THE CANADIAN DESK FOR TRANSMITTAL TO OTTAWA. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK BOTH THE OTTAWA STATICS AND SNASOVE F TEE OTTAWA STATIO THEIR COOPERATION ON THE ANCHALK CASE. IS AUTHORIZED TO PASS TO THE SMABOVES THE COMMENTS ON AMAZ REGARDING THE CUBAN SITUATION AND TELL THEY OF THE MOLLIS OPERANDI OF THE CONTACT. WE REQUEST HOWEVER THAT THE DETAILS REGARDING THE FREEING OF ROJAS AND FUTURE CONTACT ARRANGE-MENTS NOT REPEAT NOT SE PASSED. IT IS BELIEVE. THAT IT IS SUFFICIENT TO TELL THEM THAT THE COI SAIL THAT THE ANCHALK-5 OFFER OF COOPERATION LAS ACCEPTED CONDITIONED UPON APPROVAL OF HAVANA AND THAT HE WOULD BE CONTACTED SOMETIME AFTER CHI.ISTMAS.

CALLED. HE SAID HE WAS AT THE HOTEL CAPRI /FOUR BLOCKS FROM THE HOTEL AT WHICH A-5 WAS STAYING AND AS 15 KNOWN THE ALTERNATE LOCATION FOR A-5'S RESIDENCE IN MONTREAL AS RECEIVED IN THE LETTER OF INSTRUCTION./ ALBERTO INLISTED THAT A-S MEET HIM AT THE BAR OF THE CAPRI AFTER A-S ASKED HIM TO COME TO HIS HOTEL. THIS WAS IN KEEPING WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN A-5 PRIOR TO HIS DEPARTURE FROM MIAMI TO ACCURE THE INITIATIVE. A-S AFTER APPROPRIATE JELAYS ACQUIERCEC. HE SAID THAT HE RECOGNIZED THE VOICE OF ALBERTS AS BEING THAT OF GUILLERMO WHOM AMGHOST-I HAS SERT TO SPAIN FOR A MECTING WITH A-5 SEVERAL YEARS AGO. TWENTY MINUTES LATER A-5 ENTERED, THE CAPRI BAR AND NET GUILLERMO /EDUARDO ARAUZ/.

UPON ENTERING BAR WHICH WAS EMPTY EXCEPT FOR GUILLERMO HE NOTED ONE OTHER PERSON IN A CORRER BOOTH WATCHING HIM. THIS THROUGH A DEVICE HE LATER DISCOVERED TO BE ANOTHER CUIS OFFICER.

FOR THE PLOY OF A-5.

3. ACCORDING TO A-5 THE MEETING WITH GUILLERMO. IT TURNEO-
   OUT WAS FRANK AND FRIENDLY THOUGH RESERVED. EARLY IN THE
   MEETING GUILLERMO BLUNTLY QUERIED A-5 AS TO THE REASON HE
   HAD REQUESTED CONTACT. A-5 FOLLOWED THE SCENARIO AS PREVI-
   OUSLY AGREED UPON IN MIAMI. HE CLEARLY EXPLAINED THAT CIRCUM-
   STANCES IN MIAMI AND FOR HIM PERSONALLY WERE MUCH DIFFERENT
   THAN WHEN THEY HAD MET IN SPAIN SEVERAL YEARS AGO. HE SAID
   THAT HE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS HAS BEEN TERMINATED BY ALROCK,
   THAT HIS MOTHER WAS NOW DEAD AND THAT HE HAD PERSONALLY
   LOST HOPE THAT CUBA COULD BE LIBERATED. HE POINTED OUT HOW-
   EVER THAT HE STILL OPPOSED FIDEL CASTRO AND NOW MERELY
   WANTED TO HELP NEGOTIATE THE RELEASE FROM PRISON OF HIS
   FRIENDS. GUILLERMO WAS NOT SURPRISED OR DISTURBED BY THIS
   APPROACH. GUILLERMO COUNTERED WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THE
   CUBAN REVOLUTION HAD SUCCEEDED AND THE ENTIRE MATTER OF RE-
   TAINING PRISONERS WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN HAVANA ANYWAY.
   AS CONVERSATION CONTINUED GUILLERMO SAID THAT WHILE HE
   NATURALLY WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THE OFFER OF COOPERATION
   OF A-5 WITH AMGHOST-1 HE FELT QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE RELEASE
   OF FERNANDO DE ROSAS PENICHE, A RELATIVE OF A-5'S COULD BE
   ARRANGED EITHER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE OR SHORTLY AFTER CHRISTMAS,
   BUT THAT THE RELEASE OF PERSONS SUCH AS COMANDANTE GUIN WAS
   NOT CONVENIENT AT THIS TIME. TO THIS AGAIN KEEPING WITH
   THE PREARRANGED SCENARIO A-5 SAID THAT FIDEL WAS AN INGRATE
   SINCE GUIN HAD GIVEN FIDEL MUCH HELP IN MEXICO PRIOR TO THE
   INITIATION OF ACTION AGAINST BATISTA. GUILLERMO REPEATEDLY
   BRISTLED WHEN FIDEL WAS ATTACKED. ONLY WHEN FIDEL WAS
   ATTACKED DID THE MEETING TAKE ON A LESS THAN FRIENDLY TONE.

4. TAKING THE INITIATIVE A-5 ASKED GUILLERMO WHY HE
   SECRET RYBAT TELEPOUCH UFAN-671 PAGE THREE


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 105

SECRET RYBAT TELEPOUCH

HAD WAITED SO LONG TO ANSWER HIS LETTER SENT IN JULY. GUILLERMO PARRIED THIS QUERY BY ASKING A-5 WHY HE HAD NOT SENT THE RESPONSE CABLE TO HAVANA SOONER. A-5 SAID THAT HE HAD SENT THE REPLY AS SOON AS HE KNEW HE COULD TRAVEL TO MONTREAL SINCE THIS WAS HIS BUSY BUSINESS REASON. GUILLERMO NEVER DID ANSWER WHY CUIS HAD DELAYED ANSWERING A-5'S LETTER. HOWEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE CONVERSATION GUILLERMO SHOWED A-5 HIS PASSPORT WHICH SHOWED THAT HE HAS ONLY RECEIVED A VISA FOR CANADA TWENTY FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO HIS TRAVEL TO CANADA. PASSPORT SHOWED ENTRY DATE OF 14 NOVEMBER.

A-5 ASKED GUILLERMO IF AMGHOST-1 HAS SENT HIM. GUILLERMO REPLIED AFFIRMATIVELY AND SAID HOWEVER THAT THERE WAS ONE MAN WHICH HE DID NOT IDENTIFY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND AMGHOST-1.

A-5 ASKED WHETHER GUILLERMO HAD EVER GIVEN THE PACKAGE WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIM IN SPAIN TO ANCHOST-1. GUILLERMO AGAIN REPLIED AFFIRMATIVELY.

5. SINCE A-5 OFFERED TO COOPERATE REGARDING THE SUPPLY OF INFORMATION IN MIAMI WITHOUT IMPLICATING INDIVIDUALS, THE CONVERSATION GRAVITATED TO THE CHE GUEVARA ADVENTURE IN SOLIVIA. GUILLERMO QUESTIONED A-5 REGARDING HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PARTICIPATING OF ANCHALK-1 IN THE ACTION AGAINST GUEVARA. A-5 TOLD GUILLERMO ONLY THAT HE HAD HEARD THAT AMCHALK-1 HAD PARTICIPATED IN THE OPERATION AGAINST GUEVARA BUT THAT THIS WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE AMONGST MARY EXILES--WHICH IS TRUE. GUILLERMO CONFIRMED THAT HE KNEW THIS TO BE THE CASE. IN ORDER TO WARM THE MEETING A-5 SAID THAT HE SUSPECTED CHE AS A DEDICATED MAN DESPITE HIS DISAGREEMENT WITH HIS PHILOSOPHY AND ACTIONS. GUILLERMO SAID. THAT HE KNEW THAT CHE HAD BEEN MURDERED BY BOLIVIANS AND THAT NO AMERICANS OR CUBAN EXILES HAD ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN THE

SECRET RYBAT TELEPOUCH UFA-571 PAGE FOUR


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

SCCCI RYSAT TELEPOUCH

EXECUTION. ALONG THIS LINE GUILLERMO SAID THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO INCLINATION TO ASSASSINATE OR PHYSICALLY INJURE ANYONE SINCE THEY NO LONGER NEEDED TO ENGAGE IN THIS TYPE OF ACTION AND THAT A-5 NEED NOT FEAR ANY ATTEMPT ON HIM OR HIS FAMILY. GUILLERMO SAID THAT THE GREAT PREOCCUPATION OF THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT WAS ECONOMIC. IN THIS CONNECTION GUILLERMO SAID THAT THE CANADIANS WERE GREAT FRIENDS OF CUBA AND HAD HELPED AND WOULD CONTINUE TO HELP THEM. NO ELABORATION WAS MADE AS TO HOW THE CANADIANS WERE DOING THIS AND IN PURSUIT OF HIS MISSION A-5 DID NOT PROBE. GUILLERMO DID SAY THAT THE CUBANS HAD ABOUT FORTY-FIVE PEOPLE IN MONTREAL ALONE.

6. GUILLERMO SAID THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HAD CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTIVITIES OF CUBAN EXILES AND QUERIED A-5 TO HIS KNOWLEDGE OF MANUEL VILLAFANA WHO THEY KNEW TO BE IN COLOMBIA, PEDRO DIAZ TORRES IN MIAMI /DIAZ WAS INFIL GUIDE INTO NORTH NATANZAS, PEPIN NARANJO AND OTTO GINER. GUILLERMO WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN WHAT GINER WAS DOING IN SOUTH AMERICA PRIOR TO HIS DEATH IN AN AIR CRASH.

A-5 ANSWERED THAT HE THOUGHT HE WAS MIXED UP IN NARCOTICS TRAFFIC. REGARDING THE OTHERS HE SAID HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR ACTIVITIES. THE ONLY IMMEDIATE TASK GIVEN A-5 WAS TO PROVIDE CUIS WITH A HISTORY OF AVROCK ACTIVITIES AGAINST CUBA FROM 1959 TO THE PRESENT. GUILLERMO SAID HE WANTED IT IN FOUR PARTS, 1959-61, 1961-63, 1963-65, 1966 TO PRESENT. A-5 REPLIED HE WOULD ATTEMPT THIS BUT IN KEEPING WITH SCENARIO HE WOULD NOT IMPLICATE INDIVIDUALS AND THAT HE WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANYTHING IF THE CUBANS DID NOT SHOW GOOD WILL AND MEET HIS DEMANDS. HE ALSO SAID THAT UPON THE RELEASE OF ROJAS HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE WILLING TO TALK AGAIN.

7. GUILLERMO INVITED A-5 TO CUBA SAYING HIS OLD

SECRET RYBAT TELEPOUCH.

FRIENDS WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM AND THEY WOULD WELCOME HIM, THAT HE HAD LEFT CUBA TOO SOON AND THAT HE WOULD BE PART OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IF HE WOULD RETURN AND SEE THE PROGRESS MADE. A-5 THEN SAID THAT ACCORDING TO INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO HIM THE ECONOMY WAS IN SHAMBLES AND PEOPLE WERE STARVING. GUILLERMO ALLOWED AS HOW THEY DID HAVE PROBLEMS BUT WAS NO HUNGER. CHILDREN INCLUDING HIS OWN WERE VERY WELL FED AND THAT A REAL SPIRIT OF DEDICATION EXISTED IN THE COUNTRY. GUILLERMO SAID HE WAS RETURNING TO CUBA SOON AND WOULD THEN GO TO CUT CANE. GUILLERMO SUGGESTED THAT IF A-5 WOULD LIKE TO SEE CUBA RAMON DONESTEVEZ OF MIAMI OR OTHERS COULD EASILY BRING HIM TO THE ISLAND. HE ASSURED A-5 HE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE AT WILL. HE ADDED THAT WHILE THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT COULD CARE LESS ABOUT RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES THEY WERE NOT INTERESTED IN EXACERBATING TENSIONS SINCE THEIR GREAT PREOCCUPATION WAS THE SUGAR HARVEST. GUILLERMO SPOKE HIGHLY OF PRESIDENT NIXON AS A STATESMAN, INDICATING THIS WAS A WIDELY HELD VIEWPOINT. ONLY ONE THREAT WAS MADE DURING THE MEETING AND THAT WAS THAT ANY ATTEMPTS AGAINST CUBA BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE WOULD BE DEALT WITH HARSHLY. A-5 UNCLEAR AS TO THE REASON FOR THIS STATEMENT BUT SPECULATES THAT CUBAN GOVERNMENT WILL SPARE NO EFFORTS TO REACH THEIR ULTIMATE IN PRODUCTION.

3. REGARDING SECURITY GUILLERMO SAID THAT HE HAD WALKED EIGHT KILOMETERS THE DAY OF THE MEETING INORDER TO DETERMINE SURVEILLANCE SINCE HE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD BEEN WATCHED SHORTLY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL. HE FELT CONFIDENT THAT HE NOW WAS NOT BEING WATCHED. ACTUALLY THE SMABOVES TOLD NEBECKER AND NOLTHAM THAT HE WAS NOT. GUILLERMO OFFERED TO SEND A GIRL WITH A BOX OF CUBAN CIGARS TO THE HOTEL OF A-5. A-5

SECRET RYJAT TELEPOUCH

DECLINED SAYING THAT HE WANTED THE RELATIONSHIP WITH CUIE T BE HELD AS TIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT IT WAS PILOT THAT THE CANADIANS MIGHT HAVE THE CUBANS IN MONTREAL PENETRATED. GUILLERMO SCOFFED AT THIS AND AGAIN SAID THE CANADIANS WERE FRIENDS. A-5 RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL WAS NOT FURTHER CONTACTED AND DEPARTED FOR NEW YORK CITY AT 1320 27 NOVEMBER IN PREPARATION FOR MEETING WITH NEBECKER. HE WAS TOLD THAT NO FURTHER CONTACT WOULD BE MADE WITH HIM UNTIL CUIE HAS HEARD FROM HIS USING THE CHANNEL ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE LETTER FROM BRONX.

A-5 WAS INSTRUCTED TO WRITE TO THE HAVANA ADDRESS TO WHICH HE SENT CABLE ACKNOWLEDGING MEETING IN MONTREAL. A-5 SUGGESTED THAT THEY MIGHT HOLD NEXT MEETING IN MEXICO BUT THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY RULED OUT BY GUILLERMO CITING THE DIFFICULTIES CAUSED BY THE LISACA CASE. HE ALSO RULED OUT SPAIN BECAUSE HE SAID HE WAS KNOWN THERE. KINGSTON WAS CHOSEN AS THE NEXT MEETING PLACE. A-5 TOLD GUILLERMO THAT DUE TO PRECE OF BUSINESS HE COULD NOT MEET IN KINGSTON BEFORE CHRISTMAS BUT DEPENDING ON THE RELEASE OF ROJAS HY WOULD WRITE WHEN HE COULD MAKE THE MEETING AND THEN AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.

For record. Has been answered, as you know.

1. CONFUSION REIGNS. REQUEST HQS AND WH/MIAMI GET TOGETHER AS WE DESIRE PROCEED ACCORDING TO SHABOVE SUGGESTIONS MADE IN OTTAWA 6720 AND HEADQUARTERS POSITION IN REFERENCE A.

2. AT 2300 THIS MORNING NOLTHAM DISCRETELY ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE IF ANCHALK/5 AT HOTEL BUT WAS UNABLE TO CONFIRM HE ACTUALLY IN HOTEL. IN VIEW OF REF C INSTRUCTED HOLTHAM HOLD OFF ANY CONTACT WITH ANCHALK/5 AND PLACE BURDEN SQUARELY IN NEBECKER'S LAP. WE HAVE TO HOPE AND PRAY THAT DEI DOES NOT CONTACT AND ARRANGE MEETING WITH AMCHALK/5 BEFORE NEBECKER CONTACTS. BELIEVE HOLTHAM AND NEBECKER ON THE SCENE CAN COME UP WITH SOME MEANS OF CONTACTING SUBJECT WITHOUT BLOWING WHOLE OPERATION OUT OF THE WATER. REGARDLESS HE MUST BE CONTACTED AND ARRANGEMENTS MADE TO DETERMINE MEETING PLACE SO SMABOVE CAN GIVE PROTECTIVE COVERAGE. TO ATTEMPT TO PROCEED OTHERWISE IS SHEER FOLLY. CONTINUOUS SURVEILLANCE BY SMABOVES NOT POSSIBLE.

3. MONTREAL UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES IS A RATHER EXPLOSIVE PLACE. THIS WEEK IT WILL BE MORE THAN EVER AS THE TOWN PREPARES TO RECEIVE THE BOISTEROUS FANS FOR THE BIG GREY CUP GAME ON SATURDAY. THE TOWN WILL BE LOADED WITH FREE-WHEELING DRUNKS AND FRANKLY WILL BE THE IDEAL TIME TO PULL A KIDNAPPING WHICH COULD BE CARRIED OFF EASILY. SMABOVE IN MONTREAL BEING MOST COOPERATIVE BUT UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING UNLESS WE PROVIDE MEETING PLACE BEFORE HAND. AS OTTAWA 6728 POINTS OUT MEETING PLACE MIGHT WELL BE NOTRE DAME DE GRACE PARK.

4. AS HEADQUARTERS AWARE WE HAVE A LOT RIDING ON THIS SO-CALLED OPERATION. NOT ONLY POSSIBLE THREAT TO AMCHALK/5 BUT A MATTER OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SMABOVE. IF THIS "JOINT OPS" GOES SOUR IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF OUR SHORT-COMINGS AND PERHAPS RUIN FOREVER OUR CHANCES FOR ANY FUTURE VENTURES. IN OTHER WORDS RVROCK PROFESSIONALISM, AT LEAST IN THE EYES OF THE SMABOVES, IS AT STAKE. THEREFORE, I WOULD RATHER ABORT THAN PROCEED ON A HOPE AND PRAYER. NEBECKER MUST CONTACT AECHALK REGARDLESS WHETHER BLOWS OPERATION OR NOT.

Ref B says that NOLTHAM, Ottawa Station Officer, will contact AMCHALK-5 at his hotel in Montreal to try delay operation. It adds that NOLTHAM and NEBECKER (DCOS WH/Miami) will consult with SMABOVE to assure coverage of meeting. Ref C requests no contact between NOLTHAM and AMCHALK-5 for fear that operation would be exposed to DGI. Ref D requests that operation proceed only if protective coverage can be given to AMCHALK-5-DGI meeting and that NEBECKER initiate contact with AMCHALK-5 upon arrival Montreal.

MEMORANDUM:

SUBJECT:

13 November 1969

Chief,

OI/CI/O/AM

ACHALK/5 - One Agent versus DGI

In a Counterintelligence Operation

1.  The attached cable comes from Santiago, Chile, reflecting information on a counterintelligence operation in Montreal, Canada, set up in order to control domestic DGI traffic. If there are points within the cable that have not been mentioned in the cable points, which are going to be considered as higher priority than planned.

In Cuba
Physical Danger to Close Relatives

2.  It is believed ACHALK/5 still has close relatives in Cuba. The DGI's first letter to ACHALK/5 in 1967 carried an implied threat to these relatives. The writer does not know what happened to the relatives after ACHALK/5 double crossed the DGI in the 1967 meeting, but they are surely going to be in jeopardy again if they are there, because the DGI, in the writer's opinion, will eventually discover this second double cross.

3.  Furthermore, the DGI initiated an operation to assassinate ACHALK/1 who participated in Bolivia in the GUEVARA roll-up. The DGI just might consider ACHALK/5 as great an enemy as ACHALK/1.

4.  It is my recollection that when Achmed Abdallah and Fiallo, two DGI officers, met ACHALK/5 in Madrid, they were armed; moreover they clearly displayed their holsters to ACHALK/5.

AMCHALK/5's Participation in Sensitive Operations

5. ACHALK/5 has been involved in Miami-based CIA Cuban operations since 1961. The ACHILK Project (outline)

THIS APPARENT FROM STATEMENTS ALLUDING TO CUBAN SUPPORT OF SUBVERSIVES AND MILITANT SEPARATISTS IN QUEBEC BY HIGH GOC OFFICIALS AND IN FACT BY CHIEF/SMABOVE HIMSELF. THESE STATEMENTS WERE CARRIED IN PRESS AS APPARENT ATTEMPT BY GOC TO THROW BLAME FROM MONTREAL RIOTS ON OUTSIDE INFLUENCES.

THIS WILL BE MOST PLAUSIBLE TO DGI SINCE THEY UNDOUBTEDLY AWARE OF TALK IN EXILE COMMUNITY OF MASS TERMINATIONS.

TO Chief, Western Hemisphere Division;
Chief of Station, Madrid

FROM Chief of Station, WH/Miami

SUBJECT Serafin PINEIRO Losada, aka "Fifo"
Transmittal of Correspondence

Attached for the information of addressees are copies of a letter purportedly written by Serafin Pineiro Losada to Argelio Martinez del Toro, former mayor of Matanzas now resident in Miami. The original letter has been returned to AMCHALK-5. Most of the letter seems devoted to complaint that Serafin has been unjustly accused of being a member of the G-2. Of interest is the writer's reference to the death of "Pepito" (probably Jose Pineiro Losada, 201-735948) some three years ago.

5. AMCHALK-5 may also be terminated within this fiscal year. He has managed to develop a successful, full-time business and is only slightly involved in operational activity. We are holding off on his termination because of the potentially interesting operational situation discussed in paragraph 12 of reference. AMCHALK-5 thinks the black marketeers referred to may be on the verge of another trip to Hiami. It might be interesting from the JMROD standpoint to "piggyback" that channel and send in an incriminating package to a JMRCO target. AMCHALK-5 as the source of the package is already well identified through the ANGHOST operation as affiliated with RVROCK. There are the two possibilities that the couriers themselves would open the package, inspect the contents and turn the whole package over to the DSE or that they would deliver it unopened to the target. In the latter case the target might other turn it over to the DSE, destroy it, or make use of the contents for his own benefit. Content of the package would of course have to be tailored to the target but it might purport to be an agent re-supply cache. Many possible avenues would have to be explored; for the moment vo would appreciate consideration of the proposal by the Desk and JMROD staff. One of the first items to be resolved is whether or not there is an inherent "blow back" feature of the situation which could cause too much embarranament if exposed to press play. Specifically, is there a case for an allegation that RVROCK was using the international organization with which the "couriers" are affiliated for "subversive" purposes? The answer to that question probably lios somewhere in between what the contents of the package consists of and to what longths the Cubans would be willing to go to "burn" the "loyal comrade" couriers.

Disposition of Unused Airline Ticket

References: A. DIRECTOR 64936
E. UFAS-172, 23 Septomber 1968

Attached is a letter received from Pan American World Airways in response to one written by AMCHALK-5 in an unsuccessful attempt to secure a refund on the unused portion of an airline ticket. Although Pan American avers that the ticket has no value the fact remains that a person could use it to fly from Miami to New York during the period of validity (expiring 20 April 1969). The Station will hold the ticket until expiration in event that an opportunity arises where it can be used by an individual performing official travel.

Answer to WH/Miami 3326 which wan prompted by PARIS 7580

1. When AMBEDEW-1 was working for the counter revolutionary section, he became acquainted with the case of the penetration of Miguel Diaz Isalgue's group.

2. In this operation, the Cuban DOI collaborator who acted as principal agent was Horta Gonzalez, authoress of *Bejo Perole*. She came to the United States as an exile in 1963 (more or less) and lived in Miami. She was handled by "Bolo" Hartinez, Cuban BIS DOI Case Officer in the United Nations who would see Marta in New York and Miami.

3. Marta recruited two agents (at least), one of whom was a woman. He did not recall the sex of the other. She had an "infinity of contects in Miami and sent detailed reports to Habana on exile organizations and intra-mural exile politico. He does remember that Marta was living in the house of the woman she recruited. She used to send reports on Varona and Rey. Her mission was to penetrate Alpha 66.

4. AMBEDEW-1 remembers from reports that he read that:

Marta Gonsales knew the places where the reception team would meet infiltrators of Isalgue's group.
Marta Gonsalez knew the names of fishermen who were members of the reception team.
Marta Gonsales knew that Isalgue's Baf mother's house was used as a *gasa de contacto*" and that Comandante Guin was recruited by Isalgus in the mother's house.

5. Can Miami supply a list of names of people close to Isalgue to see if AMBEDEW-1 can recall the agents names. ANDEDEW-l thinks there is a good chance that they are still in place even though he has no info.

6. Marta Gonsales is now back in Habana. She left the country via Mexico and in Mexico was helțed by a Foreign Relations employee named "flores" who was about 58 years old. The Center in Mexico was


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 204

considering trying to recruit "Flores" using Gonzales. Gonsales returned to Habana in 1964-65.

In 1966, a sensational case involving Conaslon was the talk of the day in DOI Headquarters. Consales recruited a Spanish diplomat. Evidentally, the DOI tried to push the diplocst a little bit further than the diplomat wanted. The Leiter got and and refused to cooperate. (It appearn that the DOI uses the words "agento" and "Recruit" Heiloosaly).

I asked AMBEDEW-1 if Marta used her sexual prowess ad for the sake of the cause. He said she had an added advantage, she is bi-sexual.

More on Iselgue. He has one sister in Habana, a woman named Sara. The DOI suspects her of boing recruited by Isalgue even though AMBEDEW-1 could not substantiate this other than to say that she was the only brother or sister of Isalgue still in Cuba. Sara is very close to Fidel and the DOI would not dare approach Fidel with its suspicious without being able to substantiate their accusations. Fidel would blow up. The DGI has to be very careful when it approaches Fidel. Sara recently wrote a report on Microclima (1) which interested Fidel.

1. Attached please find the following (we have marked each in accordance with our lettering):

A. Two plugs which were actually cut off of the REDTOP air-conditioners by José CASTAGNA. You will note that one of these plugs is fused together to a local adaptor. This adaptor is the type utilized by the local FJSTEALERS on those air-conditioners which still have original plugs.

B. A locally produced plug which is utilized by the FJSTEALERS to replace the original plugs (A above). This locally produced plug (B) was actually taken by AMSTALK-1 from José CASTAGNA'S workshop.

C. A locally produced plug which, though slightly larger than (B) above, can be placed on the target air-conditioners.

2. In accordance with Reference B, we hope Headquarters can install an audio device in either of the above three plugs or plug/adaptor units.

1. RE PARA THREE REF PREFER NOT MIX DIFFERENT TYPES DEVICES
   IN THIS OP, I.E., ONE FOR UNILATERAL AND LESSER ONE AS SOP FOR
   BIOGENESIS. SINCE CASTAGNA WOULD BE OBVIOUS SOURCE OF INSTALLATION,
   COMPROMISE OF ONE (PROBABLY LESSER DEVICE) WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO COM-
   PROMISE OF OTHER. THEREFORE, SUGGEST WE STICK TO YOUR ORIGINAL PLAN
   OF NOT REVEALING TRUE SITUATION TO BIOGENESIS RE INSTALLATION, AND
   PLAN FOR UNILATERAL OP.

2. RE PARA FOUR HQS CANNOT MEET TWO WEEK TIMETABLE. FEASI-
   BILITY STUDY WILL TAKE ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTER RECEIPT PLUGS AND
   PREFABBING WILL TAKE AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS AFTER THAT. PLS NOTE WE
   CANNOT EVEN GUARANTEE THAT PLUGS ARE ADAPTABLE TO AUDIO DEVICE.
   MUST DEFERD DECISION UNTIL WE HAVE BOTH WESTINGHOUSE AND LOCAL PLUGS
   IN HAND.

3. AMSTALK-1 ACCEPTED BUENOS AIRES ASSIGNMENT FOR UP TO FOUR

The contact receipted for the total amount, and SPILEV then returned five of the extra fifteen thousand pesos to him. This type of activity on SHPILEV's part appears to open up interesting operationa possibilities. We plan to watch the situation carefully and will advise you.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Special Assistant to the DDO

FROM : Jackson R. Horton
Chief, Domestic Collection Division

SUBJECT : SSC Request for Information on Lykes Brothers
Steamship Company and Owen Johnson Darnell

REFERENCE : Review Staff Memorandum 76-0421/A dated 19 May 1976

1. The Domestic Collection Division (DCD) utilizes the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company primarily as a source of foreign intelligence information. Secondarily, DCD provides introductions for Cover and Commercial Staff officers to Lykes Brothers/officials for operational discussions and, on occasion, obtains assessment data from Lykes Brothers/sources on foreigners of potential operational interest. Correpondence in the DCD file on this company for the year 1962, 1963 and 1964 was confined to responses to military services requests for the registration of various Lykes Brothers employees in the Interagency Source Register and memoranda concerning a proposal to utilize an employee of Lykes Brothers, who was a member of a U.S. delegation to the USSR for the collection of foreign intelligence information on the Soviet Union.

2. DCD records indicate that Owen Johnson Darnell was considered a "source lead" in years prior to 1965 but he was never used as a source. His file was routinely destroyed in June 1971, along with other files on "source leads" which had been inactive for five years, as authorized by Chief, DCD.

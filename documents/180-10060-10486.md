AGENCY FILE NUMBER :

December 8, 1995

Status of Document: Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 21
Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

Date of Next Review: 2017

Board Review Completed: 10/24/95

Dear Miss Mordana:

Thank you for your letter of October 19, 1976. Although my schedule is kind of filled at the moment, I would be able to see you on Monday, November 1, in my office in Philadelphia at 4:30 P.M. I am sorry to make it so late in the day, but I have to be in Washington, Pa. earlier that day; and I am in Washington, D.C. the rest of this week.

Would you be good enough to let my secretary know whether you will be able to come in for this appointment. Her name is Miss Shenk.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Sprague:

I was so intrigued by your selection as Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the Select Committee on Assassinations that I had to write to you. I am an extremely bright and capable graduate of Columbia Law School (May 1976) who happens to be one of your cousin Ziporah Mordana's daughters, and one of Debora Horowitz's granddaughters.

I hope you will forgive me for thus invoking kinship, but I am so eager to work with you that I am tempted to use any and all reasonable means to help achieve that objective. "Uncle" Louis heartily agreed that I should acquaint you with my existence, and gave me your address.

My educational background includes being a Stone Scholar and "VG" student at Columbia Law School, and a Phi Beta Kappa at Barnard College (undergraduate division of Columbia University). While in law school, I persuaded the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism to admit me to some of its professional workshops (in reporting, writing, editing, etc.), and completed half the Master's Program in Journalism.

My professional legal experience has involved a great deal of litigation practice, from doing research and discovery, to writing complaints, interrogatories, pre-trial memoranda and appellate briefs, in areas ranging from anti-trust to customs seizures.

My most challenging employment has been with the American Civil Liberties Union, where I have been working since the Summer of 1975. In my capacity as law clerk to the Legal Director, I was given the responsibility for handling the pre-trial

litigation (with occasional assistance) of a bipartite class
suit involving domestic intelligence activities-so far suc-
cessfully-and was assigned to work on a case with Ramsey
Clark (writing the successful brief in his challenge to a
district court gag order).

Given my interests and abilities, it would be an in-
credible opportunity for me to assist in any way with your
investigation. Should you have any use for a very sharp
thinker and tenacious researcher, I hope you will consider me.
me. And if there is any further information you would like
to have, I would be happy to send it, and delighted to bring
it to you.

Very truly yours,

![Signature of Hari Mordana]

P.S. In case you have no idea who your cousin Ziporah is,
you might ask your mother if she remembers "Zipsy"
Horowitz from Vienna.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

Sari Mordana has told me of her interest in working on the legal staff you are assembling as Chief Counsel to the Select Committee on Assassinations. I am writing this letter to recommend Miss Mordana for such a position.

Miss Mordana has worked as my law clerk for over a year, and I am highly impressed with her ability. She is extremely bright and capable, and her superior work has made a significant contribution to the cases on which she has assisted. She has a great deal of initiative in taking on responsibility, and has handled the legal research and writing in several phases of complex litigation with a minimum of supervision, and a high degree of professionalism.

In addition to her practical legal ability, she is articulate in the law, and her writing is of an extremely high caliber. As to her personal qualities, she is an unusually alert and hard-working individual, who delights in tackling a difficult project, and pursuing it to a successful resolution.

Dear Mr. Sprague:

I understand that Sari Mordana is applying for a position on the legal staff which you are gathering as Special Counsel to the select congressional committee which will be investigating the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and John F. Kennedy. This letter is being written to recommend Miss Mordana for such a position.

I am a member of the adjunct faculty at Columbia Law School. Each spring I teach a seminar on trial practice and, this year, Miss Mordana was one of the 18 students in my class. The seminar requires substantial participation by each student in simulated courtroom events and in the critiques which follow. As a result, I believe I am able to make an informed judgment respecting Miss Mordana's ability and personality. I found her extremely bright and hard-working. But just as important I found that she had an intangible quality which unfortunately few law students possess -- a spark which ignites when she is working on a project she enjoys. This facet of her personality made her a very effective advocate. She could marshal facts and present them in a manner which attracted attention and was convincing.

Having recently been part of a congressional inquiry myself, as an associate of John Doar, I recognize the difficulties involved in the task you are undertaking and the

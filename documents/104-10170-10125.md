Las informaciones que llegan de nuestra Patria aseguran un estado latente de rebeldía, actividades de sabotajes violentos y pasivos, inconformidad en los miembros de las fuerzas armadas, grandes preocupaciones en las esferas del gobierno y un malestar general en el pueblo cubano.

No hay dudas que el Plan de Alpha 66 contribuye en alguna proporción a estos fenómenos. Primero anunciamos el desembarco de Vicente Méndez antes del 31 de diciembre con otros hombres, a pesar de las dificultades conocidas, se cumplió en gran medida la promesa. Murió en el hecho el Capitán Julio César Ramírez. Sin esperar mucho tiempo, se produjo la gran conmoción Mundial el 17 de Abril con la presencia y los combatientes del Coronel Vicente Méndez y el mayor contingente que llegó a tierras cubanas, después de 1961.

En mayo, hombres del Alpha 66 hundieron 2 embarcaciones cubanas e hicieron 11 prisioneros comunistas, repitiendo otra conmoción Mundial que motivó el escandalo mayor escenificado por el traidor Fidel Castro y su mayor derrota moral de los últimos tiempos. El gran triunfo lo consigna el pueblo de Cuba en distintos informes que poseemos de nuestras células clandestinas.

Otros movimientos positivos de distintas índoles se produjeron, unos con éxito y otros frustrados por las autoridades norteamericanas; pero en fin todos destinados a golpear duramente al tirano y alentar y respaldar a los hombres de las montañas y los grupos clandestinos que se juegan todos los días sus vidas en aras de la libertad.

Con estos antecedentes de gran valor y validez, amén de más de 20 acciones comandos y de infiltraciones realizadas por nuestros más destacados hombres y por una pléyade de patriotas que combatieron y combaten en todos los frentes de acción cubana, nos sentimos moralmente respaldados para promover un llamamiento general a los cubanos de la Isla y a los cubanos del destierro, a la guerra libertadora. No pretendemos convertirnos en sectaristas, sino que cada cual que empuña el arma que tenga, la actividad que sea compatible a sus posibilidades, la colaboración económica y el apoyo moral, a los que combaten y sobre todo, a los que en la Isla dan la pauta y llevan el mayor peso en la contienda. Sin demora tenemos que acometer acciones vitales para que éste gran momento histórico encaje en la liberación definitiva de Cuba.

Además de coordinar las cuestiones internas con otros grupos clandestinos, Alpha 66 esta distribuyendo cientos de millares de pequeños panfletos convidando a las milicias, al Ejército Rebelde y al pueblo a participar de la contienda en contra del Castro-Comunismo. Todos los cubanos que deseen cooperar a este movimiento pueden pasar por nuestras oficinas para entregarles el material que deben enviar a Cuba. Cada cubano puede servir de puente entre los de dentro y de fuera.

Por último, demandamos de todos los cubanos y de las organizaciones que pasemos de las palabras a los hechos. Que las disputas, las divisiones y las querellas infecundas se eliminen y se convierta cada uno en un esforzado militante de la causa cubana, lo requieren los hombres y mujeres que en las cárceles sostienen la gallarda rebeldía nacional, los combatientes de todos los frentes y el pueblo enclavizado. Tengamos la tragedia de nuestro pueblo por encima de mezquinos intereses y demos cada cubano un impulso y el apoyo moral y guerrero a la epopeya libertadora. De este modo podemos regresar a nuestra Patria con la frente limpia y el corazón henchido de orgullo porque supimos conquistar el derecho a ser libres.

# VICENTE RENDEZ

# VIVO

# EN CUBA

ALPHA 66 INFORMA:

Reportes que nos llegan desde nuestras células militantes dentro de Cuba, determinan que las acciones iniciadas por nuestra Organización, que en una de sus etapas culminó con el desembarco del Coronel Vicente Rendez el 17 de Abril en Oriente, estan teniendo repercusión en otras provincias de la isla.

No es sólo en Oriente donde las fuerzas internas han respondido al estímulo exterior representado por las acciones de Alpha 66; en Caniny, por ejemplo, se han promovido reiterados brotes de rebeldía traduciados en sabotajes, resistencia y en algunos casos enfrentamiento directo con el régimen.

La situación on Oriente, desde luego, es la que revela con mayor claridad la decisión del pueblo cubano de sacudirse el jugo que lo oprime. A tal extremo que los propios medios de publicidad del Gobierno comunista de Cuba han tenido que informar sobre "grandes concentraciones de las Fuerzas Armadas", en ésos sectores se debe a "rovi-lizaciones para incrementar la producción", cuando lo cierto es que la fracasada zafra de los 10 millones, ya practicamente ha terminado.

Las movilizaciones no han tenido otro objeto, según los reportes que hemos recibido, que frenar le ola de deserciones que se han venido produciendo en las filas de es Fuerzas Armadas y cubrir territorios en los que actúan eficazmente los patriotas cubanos.

Que el régimen de Castro está consciente de la cravocad del momento lo demostra entre otras cosas, la intensa purga qur se está llevando a cabo en las mas altas esferas del Gobierno, y que comezaron con la cesantia fulminante de José Llamise, esco Ministro de Educación y Francisco ladron, como ministro de la Industria Azucarera. Los desplazamientos de distintos elementos de les importantes cargos que venien sou-pando continúan especialmente en los "Estacos Mayores" de ins Fuerzas Armadas, tal extremo, de que se da por segum la cestitución del Comarcante Guillerme García Frias, Jefe cel Partido Comuristra en la provincia de Oriente, quien ha caído en "Desgracia" debido a su importancia para contener a los invasores de Alpha 66 y a los clearates que en ésa provincia se han sumado a las acciones.

Este ustado de cosas ha llegado a tal situación explosiva, que se esperan en el curso de lo que resta de éste zes importantes acontecimientos que daran un giro Aven-ble a la rebeldía cuvana frente al régimen despético que ocupa el poder.

Ese es en síntesis, el resumen de los informes que hemos recibido conde figuran ditos aún más concretes que de revelarse pormenorizadamente, pudieran acarrear graves peligros a elementos que actuan activamente en esas dos provincias zencionadas.

## Latins Want U.S. Help in Ousting Castro

At least six Latin countries seem eager to dump the Red tyrant, but are hampered by State's 'non-policy' toward Cuba

By PAUL BETHEL

> [Figure: Coast Guard Exhibits Arms Taken From Alpha-66. Exiles Say They Were Intercepted In International Waters.]

On April 17 (the anniversary of the 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco) the Cuban exile military organization Alpha-66 landed 13 commandos on the east coast of Cuba. They allegedly were captured, but if so only after Fidel Castro threw an estimated 25,000 troops into the fray. Castro lost several men as well.

Then on May 6, Alpha-66 "naval units" sank, in Cuban waters, two of Castro's high-seas fishing trawlers (used, as well, for spying and infiltrating guerrillas into Latin America).

These two actions set off a chain of events in Washington that would have done credit to the LBJ and JFK Administrations. With Castro massing his mobs for a circus of protest, the State Department hit the panic button and on May 13 called together representatives of federal law enforcement agencies to figure out ways to protect Castro from further forays of this nature.

What really teed-off the State Department was a momentary aberration by Alpha-68 to trade 11 crew members of the fishing vessels for the freedom of survivors of the April 17 landing. They soon thought better of it and sent a telegram to the Red Cross giving the location of the men and asking that they be returned to Cuba.

'CIA Invasion'

Meanwhile, Castro staged a demonstration in front of the former U.S. Embassy in Havana, which is now being used by the Swiss government. He charged the Swiss, who represent U.S. interests in Cuba, with complicity in what he called a "CIA invasion" by mercenaries.

Two Swiss employes were prevented from leaving the embassy for two days. The strategy was to mount Swiss pressure on Washington to crack down on the Cuban exiles. It worked, obviously, and the State Department again danced to a Castro tune.

The demonstration was also used to "welcome" the returning fishermen, who were soon to land at the airport in Havana, but the fishermen were late in arriving.

They were late due to an unforeseen need to change clothing. When Alpha-66 rescued the crews from the sinking vessels (turned around, Castro would have had them shot as he has ordered the shooting of thousands seeking to leave his island in small boats), they found them literally in rags.

Shoes were patched with palm bark: shirts and trousers were in tatters. So, before setting them free, Alpha-68 provided the men with shoes and new cloth-

ing. When the men arrived at the airport in Havana, they were divested of the new goodies and forced to don old worn clothing. Some, we are told, protest vehemently.

The bearded dictator took the occasion of the "welcome" extended fishermen to announce that the 10-million-ton sugar harvest was a failure. Despite closing down factories, schools and offices and marching the poor out to the fields, the harvest on which Castro had placed "the honor of Revolution" failed to materialize 1952, 350.000 guajiros cut and ground 7.3 million tons in 100 days; Castro had twice that many working and produced about 8.5 million tons in 3 days).

Back in Miami, federal agents acting on State Department interpretation of antiquated neutrality laws entered Alpha-66 headquarters. The search warrant alleged that there was evidence that 1) Alpha-66 had launched its attack from U.S. territory; 2) Cubans were

Back in Miami, federales actir. on State Department interpretation o antiquated neutrality laws entered Alpha-65 headquarters. The search warrant alleged that there was evidence that 1( Al66-בלק had launched its attacks from U.S. territory: 2) Cubans were raising funds illegally for bellicos: purposes; and 3) all of this was teing done to attack a nation with which the U.S is "at peace, to wit: Cuba."

Of the 37 items impounded, those of military significance were "one large carton filled with military-type web equipment...one military-type ficid pack...and one farge cardboard carton filled with plastic military-type canteens." With such evidence, Army-Navy surplus stores could be indicted.

Greater attention was given to files containing the names of contributors. These held special interest because the wording in the warrant found "financial contributions and disbursements to ob-taia boats and other supplies" possibly prosecutable.

Can the State Department be serious? If this section of the law were applied Impartially, how maay Jeus nou'd today te under indictment for openly soliciting funds for the purchase of bellicose materials for a foreign nation-Israci?

How many senators and congressamen would today have erg on their faces for participating in fund-raising func-ions, publicly organized and propagan lized, for that very purpose? That is how he Cuban community sees the matter.

This author has no particular objcc. il ion to fund-raising by Jewish groups in he United States. Cuban exiles certainly lo not. Indeed, Cuban Jews in exile have ontriouted substantially to Israci's war best. They are furious when they, as Cuban, try to do the same for the liberation of their country, only to find a double Sandard Lnd against them. Nor are hey happy to see their contributions go own the drain when overzealous federal Gicials seize equipment belonging to xile groups.

But what blew it for Miami's 350.-30 Cubens was an "edict" read to them by the hapless State Department representative in Miami.

According to the heads of exile action coups called to his office, the repre-entative stressed that "the spirit as sil as the law" will be upheld. He is id to have told them that fund-raising or a bellicose purpose is definitciy out-de the law and warned them not only ould they be prosecuted should they unch an attack from the U.S.. but ould also be stopped from using an-her Latin American country for that urpose.

The exact wording in the i. Juction from the State Department reads: "We would like to mane it clear that if there is sufficient evidence of activity based in the U.S. for any such military expe-dition, then the fact that a third country is used as a staging area would not preclude the U.S. from processing to enforce its laws."

When the story of State Department policy hit the streets, the Cubans exploded. Cuban students from the University of Miami and Dade Junior College (Dade's 20,000 students comprise 8,000 Cuban students) marched on the Federal Building; 60 Cuban lawyers challenged the validity of the State Department position: ccctors, dentists, educators, professional groups-57 of them-published a lengthy statement in the Diario las Americas newspaper. Part of that statement reads:

"Title 18, Section 960 of the U.S. Code (invoked against Alpha-) prohibits certain actions from being taken against a nation with which the United States is at peace-'s friend Cy nation. Clearly, Fidel Castro is not at peace with the United States or nations of the Western Hemisphere and, by breaking diplomatic relations with Cuba on Jan. 3, 1961, the United States recognized that Cuba is hardly a friendly nation."

REMINDER: We still have nearly 700 school libraries to go in filling our commitment to them for the fall. If you have not contributed in 1970, please do so now. Much of you have received a prepaid envelope. Place your contribution in it and mail today! Time is getting short.

"We conclude," the signatories said, "that this part of the neutrality laws cannot be applied against Cubans who are fighting for freedom."

Sen. Strom Thurmond (R.-C.) and Rep. William C. Cramer (R.-Fla.) strongly support the Cuban exiles in their interpretation of the law.

The most recent law outlining U.S. policy toward Cuba was promulgated and signed by President Kennedy on Oct. 3, 1962. it states that the United States .is "to work with the Organization of American States and with freedom-loving Cubans to support the aspirations of the Cuban people for self-determination." Furthermore, the United States is signatory to four inter-American pacts and treaties which clearly are designed

to combat Fidel Castro's Communist regime.

In any event, this most recent action by the Department of State lands relations between Cuban exiles and Washington at their lowest ebb since the Bay of Pigs failure nine years ago. Observers are now thoroughly convinced that the State Department is out to "get" them and willing to employ any subterfuge to do so.

One of these subterfuges, say the exiles, is a recent indictment against Andrés Nazario Sargen, head of Alpha-66. Sargen is charged with having "conspired" to purchase arms allegedly stolen from a U.S. arsenal in Connecticut. His bail was set at $100,000, then inexplicably reduced to a mere $2,500 and Sargén asked to plead guilty to be let off on a light sentence.

These shenanigans, say the Cubans, rmean that lacking proof that Alpha-66 launched its attacks from U.S. soil, the government will use other means to intimidate exile action groups. Legal action taken against Sargen, they argue, is simply the caper-beaverism on the part of what they believe to be pro-Castro functionaries in the Department of State.

On the other hand, the Department of State has its case. Many officials are only slightly less enthusiastic than Cuban crites to see the end of Castro's Communist regime. But they argue that the half measures taken by Cuban exile groups are not effective and merely serve to embarrass the United States. Others claim that the Alpha-66 attacks were merely ill-timed, providing Castro with an "excuse" to lay the failure of his sugar crop at the feet of "CIA operatives" based in the United States.

As to this latter claira, those who know Fidel Castro also know that he needs no excuse to gather the mobs and denounce the United States. The history of his 13 years in power bears full witness to the truth of this view.

## To Viable Policy

What really comes through in all of this is that Washington has yet to come up with a viable policy toward Fidel Castro to put a stop to his subverting Latia America and even the United States. The only absolute factor in the conduct of foreign affairs is the premium placed en initiative. We don't have it; Castro does.

The State Department cannot merely "wish" Castro out of power, and its policy of "economic denial and diplo-

First, A review by the Secretary of State of all disputes in which the U.S. is a party to a certain which ones, to partition of them, might lend themselves to arbitration or adjudication. Where in this review it been completed, we would urge that the United States move to take the disputes that are determined to be justiciable to the International Court of Justice or other appropriate international tribunals.

Second, the employment of the provision of Article 96 of the United Nations Charter to seek advisory opinions of the World Court by the United Nations and the U.S. Specialized Agencies on issues where such an opinion would help to clarify the legal a parts of a dispute.

Third, the instructing of U.S. negotiators to seek inclusion of a provision in future treaties and agreements which provides for the World Court's adjudication of disputes arising under there treaties and agreements.

We believe that these steps, ought through they seem, would be favorably received by the international community and lead to an enhanced regard for the rule of law throughout the world.

As Members of Congress for Peace Through Law, we have devoted considerable time and attention to this question and have sought the advice of skilled international lawyers outside the Congress.

We welcome your comments and reactions to these suggestions and would be pleased to discuss them in greater detail with you of with members of your Administration,

Cuban people's fight for independence.

Unfortunately, however, most Americans are not totally aware of the valiant fight put up by the Cuban people, alone and unaided, for nearly a century.

The Cubans fought a 30-year war from 1868 to 1898 against a powerful Spanish Army. They have consistently sought freedom from oppression and their battle for independence from 1868 to 1898 found the United States acting alongside of them.

But we cannot forget that the Cubans so loved liberty that the number of
was at the city hall in Havana and at El Morro Castle. On that date Cuba became a free country.

Most Americans know about the significance of the battle hip Maine which made the cry remember the Maine" a part of our history. But Americans know that this country interceded on behalf of the Cuban people in their fight for independence from foreign domination.

is the practical difference between land base missiles which brought on the crisis of 1962 and Soviet ships with missiles now anchored in Cuba?

It is no secret that our intelligence community fears that the Soviet Union is now prepared to establish a Caribbean fleet based in Cuba, and surely this fact must relate to our own security. I say that official efforts to protect Fidel Castro by arming freedom fighters are dangerous and not in real.

True, the State Department apparently speaks Cuban exiles on the grounds that

Cubans from the United States are in violation of our neutrality laws. But I would like to cite an interpretation of those neutrality laws as rendered by the late Robert Kennedy when he was Attorney General of the United States.

His ruling was that the neutrality laws were, and I quote:

Among the oldest laws in our statutes

casualties in these two wars of independence amounted to a quarter of a million people. The total population of the island at that time was less that 2 million.

What this means is that one out of every four Cubans became casualties in their quest for liberty.

It is shameful to say that the United States seems to have turned its back on Cuba when it is suffering from the imposition of another foreign tyranny, an international communism headed by the Soviet Union. Yet, State Department spokesman Robert McCloskey, a holdover bureaucrat, threatens freedom fighters who wish to return and help their brothers throw off the yoke of this tyranny.

My colleague, Senator Strom Thurmond, has already brought this to the attention of the Senate. It is my wish to bring it to the attention of my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the American public.

The amount of sabotage being committed by Cubans inside Cuba is in line with the tradition of its people. Just a few days ago, on Mar 15, the Castro regime announced the execution by firing squad of a campesino who burned down a super warehouse at Bahia de Sagua.

That patriot lived in Cuba and gave his life in exchange for the destruction of 2,000 tons of sugar.

From all over Cuba come official admission that the Cuban people are in massive resistance to the Communist regime of Fidel Castro.

It is fair to say that today resistance to Castro and communism is many times
*stronger than the resistance which* were not designed for the kind of situation which exists in the world today.

The late Attorney General continued and I quote from his April 20, 1961 ruling:

The neutrality laws are never designed to prevent individuals from leaving the United States to fight for a cause in which they believe. There is nothing in the neutrality laws which prevent them returning to that country to ensure the fight for freedom, nor is an individual prohibited from the United States, with others of like belief, to join others in a second country for an expedition against a third country.

I believe that ruling not only is just but also was made in the cause of our own security. Unfortunately, it has been all but forgotten by our State Department which continues to harass Cuban exiles and even instructs the U.S. Coast Guard to apprehend freedom fighters on the high sea -- a form of official piracy, I might add.

In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that Cuba is little more than a Soviet base dedicated to the destruction of our society and that of free men everywhere. I should like to emphasize that our freedom is inextricably interwoven with the freedom of the Cuban people. The ominous presence of the powerful Soviet fleet be kept just off our shores underscores this fact.

Wednesday, May 20, 1970

Mr. LUKENS: Mr. Speaker, the events at Kent State are tragic enough without having emotions aroused and magnified by biased news coverage. Today I received an article which appeared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer, May 7, by Mr. William Hickey, which illustrates the irresponsible reporting of the deaths at Kent State.

Mr. Hickey, who is a TV and radio critic for the paper is well equipped professionally.
freedom fighters in exile are concerned when their only purpose is to help their fellow man reach the liberty for which 250,000 Cubans fought and were wounded or gave their lives.

I should like to ask this question: Is it not in our own national interest that Cuba be freed from domination by a country 8 thousand times more powerful than the Spaniards of the 19th century?

Does not the presence of a fleet of Soviet Navy ships anchored in Cienfuegos Harbor pose a threat to our own national security?

Among those ships are a missile frigate cruiser and an atomic submarine. What

FROM: Chief, Los Angeles Office

SUBJECT: Alpha 66 Activities in Los Angeles Area

REF.: Your Speed Letter of 6 Oct 70, Same Subject

DATE: 16 October 1970

1. In a 13 Oct 70 interview with Johnny O'Donnell, free-lance reporter, he made the following information available regarding subject matter: The head man is Miguel Talleda, who is employed as an accountant at Hammer of California, Gardena. He has four daughters, two sons, and his wife baby-sits for neighbors in order to earn extra money. He receives about $1,000 a month. Talleda appears to be honest, hard-working, well disciplined and well organized, not overly emotional, strongly anti-Communist and anti-Castro. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, he has a P.O. Box in his name in Alhambra. The No. 2 man 1s Nextor Aranguren, also an accountant. He lives in Alhambra, and is believed to be the "bag man" who handles all money collected by the organization. It is the custom of Alpha 66 to inform their supporters how much money they receive. The rally in April 1970 at the Embassy Auditorium in Los Angeles netted them approximately $2,200.

2. One of the staunch supporters of Alpha 66 is a Dr. (fnu) DeCespedes, PhD, the granddaughter of Carlos Manuel DeCespedes, the Father of the Cuban independence who fought against the Spanish in 1868. She spoke at the Maywood American Legion Post Alpha 66 Rally in August 1970.

3. The following are Southern California city delegates: Eligio Vichot from Redondo Beach; Lorenzo Alfonso, from Fullerton, their most fiery speaker, who owns a janitorial service business; Pedro Sanchez from Culver City; Marcos Peralta, Huntington Park. Sanchez, Peralta, and Talleda flew to San Francisco with top man Andreas Nazario Sargeant of Miami when he visited Los Angeles in August 1970.

4. O'Donnell said the Alpha 66 training camp is somewhere in Mexico but they may move it to Central America as the Cubans are worried that the Mexicans might sell them out.

REF: Your memo dtd 23 Oct 70, same subject

1.  Subsequent interviews with Johnny O'Donnell resulting from reference, disclosed he has had no personal contact with the Alpha 66 group in the last two months due to personal financial reasons. He said his funds are depleted and he has had to spend all of his time looking for publishers that will pay for his contributions. He was unable to answer the questions posed in reference at this time. As soon as he gets on his feet financially he will again make contact with the group and try to learn more. He feels he has the complete confidence of the group; they are looking to him for publicity, i.e., "to tell it like it is."

2.  O'Donnell said as far as "funding channels" are concerned, Alpha 66 does its own fund raising, such as with rallies, dinners, and "nickel and dime" contributors. He does not know of any single big money contributor.

1. Periodic checking with Johnny O'Donnell regarding his contacts with Alpha 66 people has proved negative. O'Donnell is hurting financially, as reported in LA 1024-70, and he is trying to earn a living by writing articles for various publications. He feels his first concern is to his family (a pregnant wife), so he is devoting his time to anything that will pay off. He is not bitter, and said if he does learn anything in the future regarding the activities of Alpha 66, he will certainly pass it along, but he will not go out to get it at this time.

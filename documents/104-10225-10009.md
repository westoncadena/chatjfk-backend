7 March 1975

MEMO FOR THE FILE

Meeting with PACHANKIS 3 March 1975, 1345-1500, Restaurant at the Marrior Motel near National Airport

PACHANKIS stated that our old agent Miguel DIAZ Isalgue was having trouble getting his U.S. citizenship approved. DIAZ had sent in all the papers and I&NS told him the only thing left was the swearing in. So DIAZ waited a year and a half and I&NS never called him in. He called them in November 1974 and was told that there were no problems; that he would be called.

The DIAZ file shows that I&NS requested our traces in December 1974. IP/EIB sent them; there may be something in thom that is causing a problem now though that doesn't explain tho 1½ year delay before.

On 6 March, I told PACHANKIS to have DIAZ call I&NS one more time and if there is a real problem, we'd see what we could do.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, FI/Ar/Argentina

ATTENTION: Mr. Robert Rumbrini

SUBJECT: Transmittal of Nicaraguan Passport in Alias
For Use by NSWALK-1 - AB Case No. 8937

REFERENCE: WH Memorandum dated 5 April 1968, same subject

1. Transmitted herewith for use as outlined in Reference are the following two documents issued in alias for NSWALK-1: Nicaraguan
   U.S. Passport No. 86751 and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Form I-94
   (stapled in the passport, page 9). Also furnished herewith is a travel itinerary on which NSWALK-1 should be briefed before he applies for the Argentine visa in New York.

2. In keeping with arrangements made by TSD/AB, the Medical Office is preparing, for direct delivery to WH/S, the International Vaccination Certificate in alias to be used with the above documents. This certificate should be checked for accuracy as to name, place and date of issue. It is also understood that NSWALK-1 will have received a bone fine smallpox vaccination prior to departing from the U.S.

3. TSD/AB prepared the above Nicaraguan passport on the strength of information that BIOGENESIS would instruct an Argentine Consuler post in the U.S. to place a visa in the passport. The document was prepared in one week from date of request because of operational urgency. The requirement for specified use of a Central American passport, To avoid placing a long, time-consuming simulated itinerary in the passport, it was given a recent issuance date, which necessitated issuance on the basis of exemplars issued nearly one year earlier (the most recent ones available). This short time itinerary also would seem to make application at this time in the U.S. for an Argentine visa somewhat unusual. Since we are now informed that NSWALK-I is to obtain his Argentine visa without BIOGENESIS assistance we wish to make application at the Argentine Embassy by all of documentation provided for this operation, and

4. A telephone check with the Argentine Embassy by all agreed to by Mr. Rumbriat, a matter of record. This confirms discussion with Mr. Fembrini indicated that a Nicaraguan transient in the U.S. can obtain an Argentine visa in this country.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 53

Page 2.

4. It is understood that the passport will be needed for about six months, following which it is to be returned to TOD/AB. Should further opcrational need exist for this document beyond that time, it must be borne in mind that the expiration date is 7 March 1969 and tint annual revalidations are needed fron that time forward. Any cuch revalidatione would have to be entered by TOD/AD. Also, use of this passport for travel other than that originally intended (direct from U.S. to Argentina and back within six montins) will require careful scrutiny by TSD/AB of the situation at the time of the intended future travel.

5. In accordance with verbal arrangements between Messrs. Fambrini and Pinelen, please pass on to TSD/AB details of ACTALK-1's procurement of the Argentine visa and any other travel control events of significance in the use of this passport so that TCD/LB may gain from the experience of this agent in the use of this alian document.

6. Any further questions concerning this case should be referred to the undercigned or to Miss Tina Jepikse on extension 2531.

MAKE CLEAR IT UNLIKELY RAN INSTALLATION CAN BE MADE IN SOVIET EMBASSY BY AGENT TECH SUCH AS AMSTALK-1. CANDIDATES UNCOVERED THUS FAR HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE WOFIRM AUDIO DEVICES AND NO AUDIO TECH ABILITY (IN CONTRAST GENERAL MECHANICAL, TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE). APPEARS QUESTIONABLE HOW MUCH AGENT SUCH AS AMSTALK-1 CAN ACCOMPLISH BEYOND CASING. SINCE ULTIMATE INSTALLATION WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE PREFABBED DEVICE WHICH COULD BE INSTALLED BY CASTAGNA, WE SUGGEST YOU ALSO CONCENTRATE ON SUITABLE COMPONENT PARTS, ACCESSORIES OR OTHER ELECTRICAL FIXTURES USING PACY TECH AS SUGGESTED PARA 3, HARW 11024. WE FEAR THAT BY PLACING HEAVY RELIANCE ON AGENT TECH TO MAKE INSTALLATION WE MIGHT MISS OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE CERTAIN INSTALLATION USING COMPONENT PART. AS YOU MAY BE AWARE PREPARING COMPONENT PART COULD TAKE 30 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT HOS.

# DISPATCH

TO: Chief, WH Division

FROM: Chief of Station, JMWAVE UK/COS

SUBJECT: TYPIC/Operational
Termination of AMSTALK-1

ACTION REQUIRED: REFERENCES
ACTION: Cancel OA and MOC

1. Transmitted herewith are the Agent Service Record, Damage Report and Form 2457 on AMSTALK-1, who was terminated 29 February 1968. Subject was terminated for economy reasons, the lack of operational activity and because of the current JMWAVE reorganization. The termination was amicable and without prejudice. Attempts to place Subject with another JMWAVE component or the JMCHALK program were unsuccessful. Please cancel Subject's OA and MOC.

2. JMWAVE believes it worth noting that Subject has an excellent operational record and has participated in a number of special operations as a team member, team leader and principal agent. In addition, he had a hand in the recruitment of AMTRUNK-19, and, as recently as June 1967, made a WOFIRM-sponsored operational trip to Madrid.

3. As a result of the good will built up with Subject over the years of WOFIRM service and the excellent rapport maintained with him throughout, Subject offered to make himself available on short notice for any WOFIRM operational assignment. His 201 file contains his current location, in the event recontact with him becomes desirable at a later date.

INFO: Chief, Domestic Ops Division; Chief, PO Base, New York; Chief of Station, Mexico City

FROM: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: Operational/TYPIC/MIGUILE/AMSTALK
Pedro Luis PINERO Eiria

ACTION REQUESTED: FYI

Reference: HMMA-33829, 12 January 1968

1. On 30 January 1968 AMSTALK-1 was shown the passport picture of Pedro Luis PINERO Eiria, which was received at JMWAVE as an attachment to the reference, for possible identification as one of the two Cubans he had met with in Madrid on 23 June 1967.

2. AMSTALK-1 said the individual in the photo was definitely not "Guillermo". He said that if the individual was one of the two he had met with, it would have to be the second man, who used no name but gave the impression of being a bodyguard. However, he said the second man had darker skin tones; looked like an Arab or Lebanese; appeared to have some Negro blood, although he would not classify him as a mullato; and had curly hair which was almost kinky. The eyes, lips and receding hairline are very similar, but the individual he met had a large bushy mustache.

Miguel - Sientate, quieres un cigarrillo?

Guillermo - Como no, gracias.

Miguel - La situation no se cual es te das cuenta, entonces quiero conocer la si- tuacion.

Guillermo - Ante todo, vamos a tener la perspectiva de una conversacion, en todos nuestros aspectos, e incluso en la actitud necesarta quereres verle a fin de rectificar. Toda esta conversacion va a ser algo mas tecnica, lo mas armado, tratanto de subsanar, y atendo lo ras ecuantne posible.

Miguel - St, yo creo que tanto Uts. como yo, todos tenemos ...... somos cubanos, y entonces podemos conversar. Entonces que llegueres o no a un acuerdo ya es otra cosa, pero stempro podemos hablar y no creo que con eso se perjudicaran ni ids. al yo. Mis ideas Vis, saben cuales son. Stempre han sido esas, desde que luchabamos contra Batista, o sea no es una situacion nueva ni es una cosa improvisada. Y tambien saben per que me fut de Oiba. No fue ambicion politica, porque yo estaba muy bien con el gobierno y teala muchos amigos, sino simplemente porque no estaba de acuerdo con las Licas. Pero bueno es una arte de la cosa que no vares a discutir, perc re vine de los SEVU sinceramente en lo que... aqui y no es cosa de juego y estar retilo ya en la situacion esperando larado de Uls. tampoco. De Cuba liegue el jueves pasado.

Guillermo - ...... de La ihbana?

Guillermo - Como preambulo te dire que te conoceros, nos conocenes ras o menos. Saberos las ideas de (oldas?). Queremos saber que quieres tu de ideas, de accios, de hechos, de exrosiciones, colocaciones ras alla de lo debido, las ventajas, etc. Kira, fijate, cando nosotros te conoclamos durante la lucha revolucionaria de tim continental, tu no eras un tipo comun, tu eras un tipo singular.

Miguel - Yo soy un cubano mas, igual que Uds.

Guillermo - Te quiero decir, tu tienes personalidad, tentas ideas, tentas barba, te pisiste ...... mas o menos, en ura cuestion luchando por aht. Luego vienen los primeros anos donde entra una serie ya de comer en- stones en cuanto al proceso. Ta en lo que te rodea. Fijate, en cuanto a los años Interesantes, quislera que tu re hicieras un analists para poter empezar la discusion, ese año 1955-60, que te iso a til

Miguel - 1959-40, emrezande, yo nunca presencte el 26 de Julic. Fui Presidente del Directorio, fut amigo personal to Jose Antonto DEFISTICSC (fon) de CICHU (fon), de FSP (fon), de toda la gente dei Directorio. E3 RAS, munca presencie el 26 de Jultc.

Guillemo - en Santa Fe en el año en que fue convocado, un nes antes. Estaba Federico, no Federico no, Santamaria, Isaac, Fidel y no re acuento quien mas estaba. Entonces FIDEL le dice, se rio y le dija Isaac tu de Jefe del Ejercito y yo de Presidente de la Republica, a ver quien se mieve en Cuba, que fuera de estilo comunista, y desde entonces ras munca se vieren, yol retropin-ceso ya se conoce. Esa es una de las partes de ..... con las cuales yo estaba predispuesto con .... .. de Fidel, perfectamente con Fliel y conocia sus ideas, y asi fue como en el año 1956 en los EUU, en el 1957...... inclusive los primeros meses del goblemo, como diez muchachos conversamos eso y somos el ..... .... el lo sabe.

Guillemo - Fijate, viendo perspectivamente coro se representa tu suspicacia, tu desavenencia, ya visto el proceso, el desarrollo (Miguel interrupts)

Miguel - Dijimos al principio que ibamos a hablar con sinceridad, no es cierto? Ud. ve que yo hablo muy claro.

Guillermo - Fijate, nosotros tenemos que buscar un punto de coincidencia, si ro buscamos un punto de coincidencia ....(Miguel interrupts)

Miguel - Especificamente, cual es la razon por la cual Uds. han buscado que me viniera hasta aqui?

Guillemo - Mira Miguel, te voy a hacer la historia.

Miguel - Ahora comprendiendo, porque podemos estar bablamio tres dias seguidos y no nos deciros nada.

Guillermo - Eira aqui vamos a hablar con sinceridad. Tu eres un individuo que, clam, para un cubano es poco comin, entonces una serte de bobertas, boberias dentro del personal, tecnicamente mal echo, entonces-tuio. el ...... una serie de problemas que otros no podemos anticipar sobre este punto la manera necesarta y dejar la otra, era un caso especifico. Entonces que pasa, em care ponemos ..... la familia que pasa con este que esta de tanto aqui viendo a gente que como ..... Entonces eso parte de la historia; se congela la salida y la entrada de toxic el mundo allt.

Miguel - Eso que te digo de Fidel se lo dije a lacto en el año 1956 en mi casa. le dice Miguel, ven aca. Yo en aquel entonces era Presidente de la Asociacion de ...... le dijo Miguel, por que no vienes a trabajar con nosotros en el ....... 26 de Julio. To se que Fidel es comunista y tu lo sabes tamblen. So, estas equivocado, no no estoy equivocado.

Guillermo - A nosotros nos interesa en cuanto a lermo buscar la linea de coin-cidencia, porque fijate tu a tu parte es una cosa. Tu eres un agente que para nosotros ..... todavía no ....., porque en el lugar donte te colocaste no sete confia. Perc de todo que apoyas daraslado ...... desde el punto de vistatecnico, vamos a manterer una estetica.

O sea que el estado ha tenido consideraciones con ella y con el reste de la familia por ..... merece tambien, aparto de lo que haya side pe, ese es completarrate aparte de mi, yo no tengo nada que ver con cila.

## Guillermo

No tienes nada que ver pero ..... Mira chico aqui hay una cosa que esta escrita en la carta, mira (probably shows him something). ay un millon de cosas a solucionar, partiendo del entendirilento mutuo. Que ese es lo que trataros de partietparte, queremos decirto.

# Miguel

Buene, pero que tipo de enteraltriento por ejemplo?

## Guillermo

Buscar una linea, tratar de ubicar que to molesta, que to mortifica,. que tienes y entences vamos a ver, vamos a entrar en discusion, hoy, poderos tener um discusion diaria, porque esto es problema de mas de un dia, poderes discutir a ver hasta donde pateres llegar. A ver quten eres tu de veras, e que quieres. Aparte de eso, mira tu juicio es contradictorie, tu eres combatiente de un cuadro y te metes en ese bando y te desbandas en ese bando. Las cosas pre tu vlenes a plantear-nos a nosotros son centradictorias. No en el origen ideologico, que ya estamos de seuerdo tu no eres comunista, pero en la cuestion practica, es la contradiccion de la persona. Porque hay millones de cosas Ideologicas que no vamos a entrar.

# Miguel

Yo no se, especificamente ..... para que esos seneres puedan dejarla en libertad que es lo que habrta que hacer.

## Guillermo

(sreaks in very low voice).

# Miguel

Espero que no, pero estoy tratando de ayudar porque... (Guillermo interrupts)

## Guillermo

........ Mira Miguel, el (balen?) moderno de lo que el mensaje que te queriazos dar es ese. Que discutas con el, discutas un poco, no (he mentions Manele again). Quetrates de direater con el, ese es el objetivo muestro, y ademas la carta esta puesta.

# Miguel

De manera que eso, la actitud min, es una actitel, una posicion clara, deftatda, no pueden tener Uds. en ningun momente tica de que yo pueda tener un doble juego con Uds., siempre hablar con claridad. con Uds. no podria llegar mınca en la vida a ningun the de acuerdo en cuante al trabajo se reflere, porque mis ideas sen radicalmente ones.. tas a las de Sts. Eso no quiere decir que no pueda conversar con Uds. at eso no quiere decir que no les tenga afecto a Uds., que somos como bomanos, mismo lamelo, lamelo y yo stempre nes llevares bastante bien, pero ahora el esta en tuh lado y yo estoy en otro, radicalrente opuesto. No estoy dispuesto a enganarte.

Miguel - Creo que las dos lineas saben que estamos aqui.

Guillermo - Que quiere decir eso?

Miguel - Quiere decir que el gobierno de los EEU U saben, no que estoy en esta habitacion en este momento pero que estoy en Esmana y que vine a hablar con Uds. Por eso le dizo a Ud. que la intencion mia no es crear un doble juego ni a Ul. ni a mi. Ellos saben que mi madre esta en Cuba, estan conscientes de eso, y que en Cuba Uds. ...... Lo que quiero decir es que no hago juego sucio con Uds.

Guillermo - (habla de una situacion y de analizarla mas, muy dificil de ententer)

Miguel - Es una lucha que ha tenido muchas alternativas. Como Uts. vieron yo cometi un error, Uds. tarbien cometieron un error, todos cometimos errores, tolos fueron susceptibles de cometer errores. Pem siempre podemos hablar. siempre poderos hablar, este hecho por ejemplo, que estemos nosotros re- unidos aqui, hace dos o tres años yo creo que hubiera sido imposible.

Guillermo - Este planteamiento say fino, es un planteamiento que a nosotros nos pro- tege: eso st, nos protege. Temiriamos te ontrar a la orestion ideo- logica como tu planteas creo que de momento ...... En nuestra opinion, entonces el planteariento que tu lace, que tengo que hacer yo?......

Miguel - Yo no haria nada que afectare en ninguna forma mi modo de pensar. Ya le digo no tengo ningen intoms en hacerles que tengan una idea equivoca o erronea, un doble juego como se que hay quien lo hace, que se ponen a hacerle juego a Uds. para ver lo que dicen o hacen. Yo vivo en los EEU, me siento cubano, soy cubano y debo sentimo como tal, y quiero a Cuba y quloro a mis amigos que estan alla, no a los amigos que estan en el gobierno, otros que estas presos, y por eso he venido aqui a conver- sar con Uds.

Guillermo - Esa es una disyuntiva un poquito cerrada, un poquito cerrada. Yo no puedo creer sobre los amigos que tu tienes alla y que estan en el gobierno, no se que no te gustaria nada positivo para ellos. Los otros amigos que tu tienes alla que estan presos, esos si que tampoco puedes esperar nada positivo para ellos. Hay una cosa cierta, a tra- ves de 3 años que son 2 años de revolucion, tu sigues manteniendo una conducta en tu opinion nunca jamas equivocada. Hasta cuando tu podras seguir manteniendo esa linea de conducta? 27, 14, 15 anos? Tus arigos seguiran presos, yo wa tendre una opinion quizas no ruy buena de ti. El problema de Cuba yo ne creo que se defina en una forma facil. Cuba ya no es un caso aislado, tu lo sabes. Cuba forma parte de un problema continental incluso mundial.

Miguel - Por desgracia, tanto para Vis, como para nosotros.

Guillermo - Nosotros no, nosotros por suerte. Pero bien, esa es la situacion. La situacion es un roce dificil. Porque EUC no han rotido liquidar ...... Arerten Latina es un continente en revolucion, Asia también, Claro, estos son miestme mantes de vista que or sumiesto meden ser muy divergentes a los tuyos.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 129

Guillermo - Cuando eramos mas debiles, cuanto estabamos mas aislados, no podíamos influir, en cambio el que hubo ahora tengo una fe absoluta (?). Es una situación dificil y perspectivemente, no se, quiza tu entres en analisis perspectiva de lo que tu hagas.

Miguel - Hay una cosa que es la siguiente, estaba analizando la situación. Desde el punto de vista de Uis. esta bien; ahora el punto de vista mio es el siguiente: yo no soy comunista, por lo tanto .... en Cuba.... las ideas...

Guillermo - Fijate, mira yo te diría a ti otra cosa. Yo te diría a ti que en Cuba hay gente que no es comunista, que no simpatiza con la revolución, que es Catolica que tienen todas sus ideas, de todo tipo, sociales, predi-cales, diversas en general, no coincidentes con las ideas de la revolución, sin embargo estan en Cuba, tienen sus ninos, tienen su trabajo, disfrutan de sus vacaciones, o sea que es una actitud de familia que Una cosa es el ciudadano que se va a los EEUU e se va para Pakistan Occidental que no quiere saber nada mas de Cuba.

Miguel - El que se vaya de Cuba y no quiera saber mas de Cuba no es buen cubano.

Guillermo - O quiera saber de Cuba, se entere por la prensa, como avanza la revolución, las dificultades de la revolución, la situación mundial por la zona de Cuba, Cuba con relación a la situación mundial, se sigue enterando, se siente cubano, tiene una bandera cubana en la casa, se sigue sintiendo cubano. Sin embargo, se dedica a una serie de juegos un poquito peligrosos, tu te das cuenta? Introduccion de RF 48A (fon), introduccion de ....... Introduccion de .... y hasta ahora nosotros no hemos tenido mas remedio que defendernos, defendernos de la forma mas humana posible, porque yo te digo a ti realmente con el cargo que tenia tu hermano (7) que .... era para ..... estabamos hablando en nuestro propio idioma. Nosotros no podemos estar dando borbones al que nos tira piedras, y ademas vacaciones al que nos introduce materiales de espionaje.

Miguel - ........ exactamente igual.

Guillermo - Quizas, si.

Miguel - En los EEUU no, porque en los EEUU la situación del pais es distinta, a la de los paises latinos. Es mejor.

Guillermo - Hay una diferencia sensible, por ejemplo nosotros no lo hacemos digamos contra nuestro propio pais, contra nuestro propio pueblo.

Miguel - Tu crees que el pueblo de Cuba esta contento con la situación de ahora?

Guillermo - Yo creo que si, mira yo te voy a decir otra cosa para que tu tengas una idea clara y nitida de esto. Hay una serie de gente con nivel cultural bastante jodido que no tienen porque ponerse en contra de la revolución, aunque no sean revolucionarios sinceros, que si miramos del punto de vista económico, han mejorado con la revolución, si lo miramos desde el punto de vista politico, han mejorado tambien, te das cuenta? Entonces a esas personas nosotros los consideramos tambien parte del pueblo de Cuba. Mira, a nosotros no nos preocuparia mucho de que tu lograses de tu (?), incluso .... un mulato, tu te das cuenta?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 130

Miguel - El problema es que esos señores, con mi forma de pensar tampoco me daría muchos resultados. No sería valioso para eso.

Guillermo - (Talks about how unsuccessul they've been, very difficult to understand what it is...... que tu estes con un servicio de inteligencia de un pais que esta tratando de .......

Miguel - ¿del comunismo?

Guillermo - Vamos a hablar de esto como liderago de que? Vamos a llamarlo por su nombre. De la escuela. Cosas concretas porque se habla en abstracto se parece a la otra (7) Cuando se habla en concreto tenemos que llegar al sistema social de algo, a escuelas, a hospitales, a comida, a exis- tencias sociales.

Miguel - ........ sistema social que se conoce por "el nombre comunista de capita- lista y en los sistemas sociales se puede progresar....... como el cambio de fusta de la época de los zares a la fecha actual es una cosa increíble, posiblemente minas se ha visto....... por eso los EEUU y otros países como los EECU tambien .......

Guillermo - Igual que el de Perú, el de Ecuador, el de Bolivia, el de Brasil.

Miguel - Tu sabes el problema de Sudamérica cuales.

Guillermo - (interrupts), El origen de esta cuestión es muy simple. En primer lugar tu tienes la Cuba de tu información parcial. Esta la otra Cuba, la Cuba que combate, la Cuba que rinde, la Cuba que va el 31 de diciembre, 300.000 o 400.000 a un lugar a festejar, la Cuba que tiene cuero. Tu basas tu información en base a que? EEUU esta viviendo a costa de Nicaragua, de Costa Rica, de Bolivia, de Panamá. Porque mira, al hablarcu de liberación lo primero que tendríamos que liberar sería la humanidad.

Miguel - La situación actualmente en Cuba no es de la mejor. Hay escasez de de todo. Negar eso sería faltar a la forma en que estamos conversando.

Guillermo - Sí, hay escasez, eso tu sabes por que hay escasez? Porque todo el mundo corre, son dos cosas que se vienen hacia ati. En toda Cuba, desde la sierra, no hay un niño, no hayun anciano, no hay un hombre que se quede sin correr, pero hambre hambre entiendan no hay.

(Then they talk about 5 minutes, very difficult to understand, possibly about Cubans living in Miami and how they live.)

Guillermo - No nos ponemos de acuerdo.

Miguel - Para mi hubiera sido una posición mas cómoda haberle hecho juego a Ud. y lo pude haber hecho, puesto que he venido aqui, nadie me conoce aqui, nadie sabe que yo estoy. Hemos hablado con sinceridad. Otra cosa, no creo que hubiera sido correcto crear un doble juego y acertar, cambiar mi manera de pensar. Eso seria lo que casi cualquier otra persona hubiera hecho pero yo prefiero... Espero que algún día cambie de manera de pen- sar. El mundo da muchas vueltas y quien sabe, nadie sabe, ahora esta fanatizado con esas ideas, a lo mejor cambia.

Así es, mucho grato.

The letter believed to be from AMGHOST-1 was mildly threatening to AMSTALK-1's family and friends in Cuba and suggesting a meeting with the CUIS in Spain or Canada. Local LNERGO not advised. AMSTALK-1 and JMWAVE Case Officer are currently in Madrid on this operation. It is believed that this operation was initiated by AMGHOST-1 for unknown reasons, but possibility exists it is to establish a communications channel to WOFACT.

UFLT A540/03
#62336
17 May 1967

Subject: Iden A

AUSTALK/1 was interviewed and tested at a covert site is the Miami,
Florida area on 17 May 1967 at the request of Stanley B. JERSAVIT.
The interview was conducted in English in which AMSTALK/1 is fluent.

Testing was requested following receipt by AUSTALK/1 of a recruit-
ment letter, apparently from the Cuban Intelligence Service. Details
regarding the letter were forwarded to Headquarters under UFGA-27562.

AUSTALK/1 is presently a WOFACT principal agent who, although he
never worked with the CUIS, was acquainted with numerous Cuban Intelli-
gence personalities. He was last GSikied on 7 December 1960.

## RESULTS

AUSTALK/1's cousin, Iden B, did bring AUSTALK/1 a letter from Cuba
and AUSTALK/1 believes that the letter came from the CUIS.

AUSTALK/1 was never previously contacted by the CUIS and he has not
been given any means of contacting the CUIS which he has not revealed to
WOFACT.

AUSTALK/1 has no reason to believe that his cousin has not told him
all she knows about this matter and he himself is not concealing from
WOFACT anything that he knows about it.

AUSTALK/1 cabled a reply to the letter exactly as instructed by
WOFACT.

While future intentions are not a valid topic for SEBZIEL testing,
AUSTALK/1 was asked during testing whether he is now willing to engage
in an operation involving direct confrontation with the CUIS and whether
he would continue his anti-Castro activities even though his friends or
relatives in Cuba might be in danger. For what it is worth, there was
no indication of deception when AZSTALK/1 replied affirmatively to both
of those questions.

## DETAILS

Prior to testing AUSTALK/1 mentioned that during the pre-Castro era
he was frequently in contact with persons now in the upper echelons of
the Cuban government. Among those were Iden C and Iden D. Although he
was asked on numerous occasions to join the 26th of July Movement he was
never asked to work for CUIS or contacted by Cuban Intelligence with
respect to working for them prior to the present instance.

ANSTALK/1 said that ne bolioven that Idan B has passed on to him all the information who was told to by the CUIS, !to sald however that Idoa B talked with Iden C about forty-five minutes and be fools cortain that Idan C told her more about his (AMSTALK/1'6) activities than sho has admitted knowing.

ANSTALK/1 said that Idon B told Iden C that she would not cooperate with the CUIS in any action which would bara her husband, Idon E, who is prosontly in prison in Qiba. She was apparently ro-ausured that what sho was to do would not make her husband ashamed of her. For this reason ANSTALK/1 says that he fools that the Intent of the CUIS is to noutralize him. ANSTALK/1 is of the opinion that the CUIS thinks he occupies a much moro important position within WOFACT than ho actually does.

ANSTALK/1 said that he is perfectly willing to follow WOFACT directions; that ho will gladly engage in a direct confrontation with the CUIS if this is desired and that he would do so oven though friends or relatives of his in Cuba might be in danger.

ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES:

Action Required: FYI

References: A. JMWAVE 6942, dated 2 May 1967

JMWAVE 6980, dated 4 May 1967

Attached for Headquarters information and evaluation are copies of three JMWAVE memoranda, WSO's 3012, 3013, and 3022, covering the background and events of the CUIS proposal to AMSTALK-1 requesting a meeting to be held in either Canada or Spain. It should be noted that some information reported initially is corrected in later memoranda. As presented in references and brought out in more detail in the attached memoranda, the operation by the CUIS seems to be directed by Manuel PINIERO; the professionalism shown in the preparation of the message and the subsequent concealment of the message word certainly not warranted by the circumstances. If the purpose were only to get a message to AMSTALK-1, a simple typed letter in a sealed envelop would have done the job. The use of strip film which necessitates special equipment for reading, also suggests the possibility that the entire operation is designed for the purpose of opening a channel to WOFACT. PINIERO would probably assume AMSTALK-1 would report the incident to WOFACT and the utilization of professional techniques might be a means of establishing bona fides in order that WOFACT not dismiss the message as other than genuine. Also attached for Headquarters are photographs of the crucifix in which the message to ANSTALK-1 was concealed.

SUBJECT: Recruitment Proposal Received by AMSTALK-1.

1. On 25 April 1967, RAMSKILL and COBFIELD met with AMSTALK-1 at safehouse #316 at his request for the purpose of discussing what the agent described as "a matter of urgency".

2. AMSTALK-1 said that his cousin, one Marta ISALQUE Rodriguez, 44 years old, arrived in Miami via the Freedom Flight on 11 April 1967. She is the wife of Fernando de ROJAS, who is presently serving a 30 year sentence in La Cabana Prison for conspiracy against the Castro Government. Marta had applied for exit from Cuba some time ago, but it wasn't until she wrote a letter to Manuel PINEIRO, aka Barba Roja, Director of the DGI and close family friend of the ISALGUE's prior to the Revolution, that she had any inkling that her exit request would be honored. Following dispatch of the letter, she was telephoned by PINEIRO who said that he had taken her case under his personal supervision, and that she would be visited by someone from his office in the near future. The following day, PINEIRO's secretary called on Marta to discuss the situation, and obtain necessary additional details. Not hearing anything concrete for about one month, Marta again wrote to PINEIRO, who again telephoned her saying that immediate action would be taken. The follow- ing day she was visited by two men who claimed to be from PINEIRO's office. One identified himself as MENENCEZ and said that he was a former close friend of AMSTALK-1. They gave Marta a definite date for her departure from Cuba, and promised to return again to insure that the plans were working smoothly. Just prior to leaving Cuba, Marta was revisited by the two PINEIRO representatives, and was told that she had been

granted a farewell moeting with her husband in a cabana. On her way to the airlift, she was permitted Jongthy conversation with her husband, and was giver a ww cross to attach to hor rosary beads, and told that inside the croва was a message for ANSTALK-1 in Miami, and that she would be doing ANSTALK-1 and herself a favor by delivering it. MONENDEZ added that the message was from a good friend of ALLSTALK-1's. Marta later boarded the Freedom Flight under the supervision of MENDEZ who permitted hor to bring with her certain of her personal jowolry which a normal exile is not permitted.

2. AMSTALK-1 avoided meeting Marta at the airport for reasons of security, and saw her for the first time on the following night, 12 April, but there were so many friends and family present that they had no chance to talk alone. Marta did indicate, however, that she wanted to have a long talk with AMETALK-1. The following day, Marta loft for Wost Palm Peach where she stayed with rolatives for about one week. She returned to Miami and telephoned ANSTALK-1 on 24 April, at which time a meeting was arranged for the same evening. It was at this meeting that Marta gave AMSTALK-1 the above story and the rовагу.

3. There is attached a translation of the message to AMSTALZ-1 which was hidden in the lower upright of the cross. It appears to be a positive 35mm film strip of one frame. According to TSB, it was a professional concealment job. The name and address to which ANSTALK-1 may direct his replies is unknown to the agent, although all of the facts in the message indicate that the writer knows ANSTALK-1's position exactly. The agent believes that the reason for the sonding of the messago, at this time is that he was involved in the CUBELA/GUIN wrap up and because this is the first time that a close relative of his has come out. The agent has agreed to follow whatever instructions wo may have for him without question, and reiterated that the Cuban colony here and the Castro Governmont know that he cannot be influenced by any such threats of blackmail against his family, a condition he has been living with for the last five years.

4. In addition to the above, Marta provided the following information:

a. AMTRUNK-19, cousin of both Marta and AMSTALK-1, appears to be assuming a role of lesser importance in his job and in Cuba as the result of the departure of

a. Che Guevara, to whom ho was very close. ANTRUNK-19's wife, who used to be a secretary to the wife of Raul CASTRO, has all but dissassociated herself from revolutionary activity. She was formerly very active.

b. Jone MASIP Isalgue, another cousin, is still writing for the Cuban Institute of the Theatre. He remains very pro-Communist.

c. Antonio MASIP Isalgue, another cousin, is presently in East Germany studying. He cannot return to Cuba. He previously studied and/or worked in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland.

d. Certain fruits which are grown in Cuba, but were heretofore exported and unavailable locally, are now plentiful. On occasions they are given free to the public in the local markets. On the other hand, canned Soviet goods, which were plentiful before, are now almost non-existent.

e. The Isle of Pines was closed and the 50,000 prisoners have been transferred to the mainland to work on farms.

f. A live-and-let-live attitudo has been adopted by the Castro Government in relation to the opponents of the regime. Persecution is falling off.

g. Marta's husband, Fernando de ROJAS, was sent to Matanzas following the CUBELA/GUIN wrap up, and was interrogated, but was exonerated from any implication, and returned to La Cabana,

h. During Karta's conversations with her husband prior to her leaving Cuba, the two PINEIRO agents joined in the talk without being in any way oppressive, and encouraged Marta and her husband to suggest ways in which "the system" might be improved.

5. ANSTALK-1 was asked about the possibility of Marta's providing additional information or support, and if she might consent to entoring into contact with an American. The agent made it clear that she was frightened by what the implications of the message she had brought out for AMSTALK-1 might be, and had no intention of getting any further involved in clandestino relationships, since both her husband, and adopted mother (mother of ALLSTALK-1) were still in a dangerous position. AMSTALK-1 was instructed to review the message he had received, talk again with his cousin, Marta, and add whatever he could to amplify the available information in this matter.

Miguel: In the last years of the revolutionary process we have been in contrary positions and, at times, our acts have affected your decisions to oppose us by serving third interests. The struggle has had its ups and downs, but without a doubt, the weight is now in our favor.

Your decision to oppose us, I repeat, drove you to resort to using your *family* and *friends*; who have been progressively rolled up, such as Fernando, Carlos, Ramon, Gina and others. Since this is a war to the death, as far as we are concerned, our strength permits us the luxury of not retaliating indiscriminately. But our accounts are not paid and you must understand that in this type of struggle, there must be an eventual clearing of accounts.

Miguel, you know that we have concrete proof against persons close to you, against whom, until this time, we have not acted. These persons, in additions to the crime for which they are directly responsible, have dedicated themselves ultimately to the violation of many other laws of the country; the stimulus and example you have set in this matter has made you responsible for this. Even in light of the foregoing or any other of your economic or social needs, we ought to exchange opinions.

Our proposition is: To have a meeting in Canada or Spain, where we would discuss the entire situation with the intent of forgetting the past and examining present realities.

To let us know of your decision to go to one or another of the countries, send a cable to the address which is appended. If you will go to Canada, sign it Enrique, if Spain, Guillermo. Send this cable a month prior to your departure. When you arrive in the chosen country, send another cable indicating your exact location and contact instructions. If you are unable to go to either of the countries mentioned above, write an open text letter explaining why you can't, and an alternate suggestion.

Remember Miguel, that others depend on your decision. For this reason we recommend you be discreet. The bearer can add some details to our proposition.

You decide if the war is to continue. Some of we old fig' who remember you prefer that it does not.

1. COBFIELD and RAMSKILL had a second meeting with AMSTALK-1 at S/H 316. An enlargement of the message which was concealed in the crucifix and brought to Miami from Cuba by the cousin of AMSTALK-1 was shown to AMSTALK-1. He read the message and the English translation, commenting that the English coincided with his own interpretation.

2. AMSTALK-1's reaction to the contents of the letter was mild and he did not appear too concerned about the threats to his family (paragraphs 2 and 3). He stated that he did not recognize the name at the bottom of the letter (Arturo PITA Rey) and commented that from talks with his cousin he believed the real sender of the letter was Manolo PINIERO "Barba Roja" (Director of the DGI), and that the name and address was probably an accomodation address used by the Cuban Intelligence Service.

3. AMSTALK-1 identified the names in Paragraph 2 as follows:

Fernando - Fernando de ROJAS - husband of AMSTALK-1's cousin, Marta (the source of the message) presently serving a 30 year jail sentence in Havana. Fernando de ROJAS was described by AMSTALK-1 as a fanatical Catholic.

Carlos - Carlos PEDRAZA - husband of Gina ISALGUE who is AMSTALK-1's aunt and also in jail.

Ramon - Ramon GUIN member of former AMTRUNK net and connected with Rolando CUBELA presently sentenced to Isle of Pines Prison.

Gina - Gina ISALGUE sister of ANSTALK-1's mother and wife of Carlos PEDRAZA, presently in jail.

In addition ANSTALK-1 stated that the regime might also take action against his mother and another sister of his mother living together in Havana (ages 72 and 78 respectively) and unable to obtain permission to leave Cuba, and Andres VARGAS Gomez, a friend presently serving a jail term in Cuba.

4. ANSTALK-1 agreed to follow whatever course of action we wished, i.e. in terms of answering the letter, not answering it, arranging a meeting according to the instructions contained in the message, or other. He was told not to take any action ro answering the letter until we advised him of our interest.

SUBJECT: May 1, 1967 Meeting with ANSTALK-1 Concerning Recruitment Proposal He Received.

1. For the meeting AMSTALK-1 prepared the attached material. Attachment 1 is a type written report by AMSTALK-1 of events which took place in Cuba between his cousin, Marta ISALQUE Rodriguez de ROJAS, and Manolo PINEIRO and his representatives. Attachment 2 is a message written by ANSTALK-1 and addressed to PINEIRO containing his thoughts regarding a possible answer. (The message has not been sent by AMSTALK-1, and he will not take any action without our concurrence.)

2. On April 30, 1967 ANSTALK-1 met with his cousin. According to his cousin, the only persons, who know about the crucifix, and the conversations about it and the message, are Manolo PINEIRO, MENENDEZ and the other representative of PINEIRO inside Cuba; and AMSTALK-1 and herself in Miami. She told AMSTALK-1 that none of the conversation about the crucifix or the message took place in the presence of her husband, at the jail, and that MENENDEZ and the other PINEIRO Representative, specifically cautioned her not to reveal anything about the subject to anyone including members of the Cuban G-2, security etc. To her knowledge no one else knows about the subject. As a sidelight she told AMSTALK-1 that MENENDEZ had informed her that unless she cooperated with then and agreed to carry and deliver the message, she would not be permitted to leave Cuba; but that the other individual with MENENDEZ, interrupted at this point and told her that she would be permitted to leave whether or not she agreed to do as they asked.

3. ANSTALK-1 also stated that his cousin told him that she had not been asked by PINEIRO, or his representatives, or anyone else, to carry any other messages or do anything else for then in the U. S.

TO PAUL

FROM DAVID

SUBJECT: MESSAGE BROUGHT FRO CUBA BY BY MRS. MARTA ISALGUE
RODRIGUEZ, WIFE OF FERNANDO DE ROJAS PENICHE, WHO RESIDES
AT 4740 NV. 1ST. MIAMI, FLA, TELEPHONE 115-3100.

BODY OF THE INFORMATION: MARTA IBAIGUE'S HUSBAND WAS
CONDEMNED TO PRISON FOR 30 YEARS IN 1961, ACCUSED OF
CONSPIRING AGAINST THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT AND OF LEADING
THE ORGANIZATION OF ING. RAY IN HAVANA. HE WAS FIRST HELD
AT THE ISLE OF PINES AND IS CURRENTLY AT LA CABANA, HAVANA.

MARTA ISALGUE HAS THREE CHILDREN, 11, 9 AND 7 YEARS OLD,
AND BECAUSE OF HER CHILDREN SHE HAD BEEN TRYING TO LEAVE
CUBA FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. MRS. VARTA IS A CHILDHOOD FRIND
OF MANUEL PINEIRO, AS WELL AS ALL HIS FAMILY. FOR THIS
REASON SHE DECIDED TO WRITE HIS & LETTER AT THE END OF THE
MONTH OF JANUARY 67, SO THAT PIEIRO WOULD HELP HER LFAVE
CUBA. THIS SHE DID AND APPROXIMATELY TEN DAYS FROM THEN
A MAN APPROXIMATELY 45 YEARS OLD APPEARED AT HER HAVANA
HOUSE LOCATED AT REPARTO DEL VEDE. THIS MAN CLAIMED TO
BE PINEIRO'S SECRETARY (EXECUTIVE SECRETARY), WHO TOLD HER
THAT MANOLO HAD RECEIVED HER LETTER BUT BECAUSE OF HIS
MULTIPLE OCCUPATIONS IT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO
SEE HER; HOWEVER, HE HAD SENT HIX SO THAT HE WOULD HELP HER
MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND THAT THE FOLLOWING


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 198

DAY HE WOULD GO 1 INSIGRATION TO ARRANGE FOR HER DEPARTURE.

APPROXIMATELY 25 DAYS FROM THE FIRST LETTER, MARTA SENT
A SECOND LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR IN
WHICH SHE REQUESTED SHE BE ALLOWED TO KNOW WITHOUT ANY
EVASION IF HER PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED OR NOT, THE NEXT
DAY MANOLO PINEIRO TELEPHONED HER AND SPOKE WITH HER FOR
45 MINUTES. DURING THE CONVERSATION, ALMOST AT THE END OF IT,
HE ASKED, "AND YOUR BROTHER?" SHE REPLIED, "WHAT BROTHER?"
AND THEN HE SAID, "MIGUEL WHO HAS BEEN VERY CALM LATELY,"
SHE REPLIED, WHAT EISE COULD SHE DO. SHE HAD THREE CHILDREN
AND HAD TO WORK HARD FOR THEIR SUPPORT. AT THE END OF THE
CONVERSATION PINEIRO TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD SEND SOME FRIENDS
TO SEE HER. THE NEXT DAY TWO MEN ARRIVED. ONE OF THEM USING
THE NAME OF MENENDEZ SAID THAT HE KNEW ME AND THAT HE HAD
A LETTER FROM A FRIEND TO SEND ME. USING THIS PRETEXT HE
ASKED MARTA FOR AN OBJECT WHERE HE COULD INSERT A MESSAGE.
MARTA SHOWED HIM SEVERAL THINGS AND HE CHOSE THE CROSS.
AT THAT MOMENT HE TOLD HER THAT SHE WOULD BE LEAVING ON 11 APRIL
AND THAT HE WOULD COME TO PICK HER UP SO THAT SHE WOULD SEE
HER HUSBAND BEFORE SHE LEFT. 10 DAYS LATER HE RETURNED WITH
THE CROSS AND TOLD HER WHERE THE MESSAGE WAS HIDDEN, THEN
TOOK HER TO SEE HER HUSBAND AT LA CABANA.

MENENDEZ RECOMMENDED TO MARTA MAXIMUM DISCRETION EMPHASIZING
THAT ONLY FIVE (5) PERSONS KNEW OF THE MESSAGE: MARTA, THEY
TWO, PINEIRO, AND OF COURSE I WHO WOULD FIND OUT WHEN THE
MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED TO ME AND THAT MY REACTION UPON
RECEIVING IT COULD DEPEND ON THE SOLUTION OF MANY/FAMILIAR
PROBLEMS OR PROBLEMS OF THE FAMILY THIS MENENDEZ WAS
PRESENT WHEN MARTA CHECKED IN AT THE LAGUITO IN EAVANA AND


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 199

ALSO AT THE VARADERO AIRIORT WHEN MARTA LEFT FOR THE UNITED STATES. THEY ALSO DEMANDED THAT SHE DID NOT MENTION TO ANYONE OF THEIR CONVERSATION NOT EVEN WITH ANY MEMBER OF THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR THAT IT WOULD NOT LE THEM.

THE INTERVIEWS TOOK PLACE IN MARTA'S HOUSE IN HAVANA.

MANOLO:

RECEIVED YOUR LETTER THRU MY SISTER MARTA AND MY
ANSWER IS AS FOLLOWS: SINCE YOU GAINED THE POWER IN
CUBA IT WAS MY DECISION TO FIGHT YOU; HAVING DONE SO
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT NOT DUE TO FOLITICAL OR ECONOMICAL
AMBITION BUT TO THE IDEOLOGICAL DISCREPANCIES YOU WELL
KNOW. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THAT IN/1956
WE SAW EACH OTHER AT THE CAFE WHICH BELONGS TO YOUR
COUSIN IN AGUIAR AND OBRAPIA IN OLD HAVANA. THEN YOU
TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE GOING TO THE SIERRA MAESTRA AND
I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS LEAVING FOR THE UNITED STATES. FROM
THAT TIME AND EVEN BEFORE THEN WE HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE
SAME IDEOLOGICAL LINES. I KNOW THAT I HAVE FAMILY AND
VERY DEAR FRIENDS, SOME IMPRISONED AND OTHERS AT YOUR MERCY,
IN MY COUNTRY, BUT THAT I / FROM THE TIME I CLANDESTINELY
LEFT CUBA. FOR THIS REASON I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE
REALIZATION OF THESE FACTS COULD AFFECT YOU ON ME. IF
THE SCALE IS IN YOUR (PL.) FAVOR AS THEY SAY AND IF
AS YOU SAY YOU HAVE BEEN GENEROUS, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
YOU ARE GOING TO CHANGE YOUR WAY OF ACTING FOR THE PLEASURE
OF PUNISHING SOME ELDERLY AND POOR INDEFENSIVE PRISONERS.
WITH REGARDS TO A CONVERSATION I HAVE NO OBJECTION IN HAVING
ONE
AT ALL IN ANY ONE OF THE TWO COUNTRIES YOU HAVE MENTIONED
AS LONG AS YOU SEND ME THE MONEY FOR THE ROUND TRIP FARE
TO THAT LOCATION AND,OF COURSE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT
THE ONLY OBJECTIVE OF THE TRIP IS TO CONVERSE PREFERABLY WITH
YOU MANOLO, SINCE WE BOTH KNOW EACH OTHER.

C. IN CIRCUMSTANCES, THIS PROFESSIONALISM APPEARS UN-NECESSARY.

2. ABOVE LEADS JMWAVE TO BELIEVE THAT PINEIRO, IN SETTING UP OP, FULLY EXPECTED AMSTALK-1 TO TURN MATTER OVER TO HIS WOFACT CASE OFFICER, WHO COULD EASILY READ STRIP FILM LETTER AND FOR WHOM USE OF STRIP FILM AND FROFESSIONAL CONCEALMENT DEVICE WOUL PROVIDE BONA FIDES THAT THIS ACTUALLY IS CUIS OP.

IN SHORT, APPEARS TO STATION THAT PINE IRO FULLY EXPECTS, IF AM STALK-1 MAKES MEETING REQUESTED, THAT IT WILL BE UNDER WOFACT SPONSOSHPP.

3. IN THIS TRUE, PURPOSE OF OP IS UNCLEAR. APPEARS DOUBTFUL THAT CUIS AIM IS TO KIDNAP OR OTHERWISE HARM AM STALK-1; WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DO IN CANADA OR SPAIN, AND HAVE NO REASON BELIEVE THEY CONSIDER AMSTALK-1 SUFFICIENTLY

# DISPATCH

To: Chief, WH

From: Chief of Station, JMWAVE.1

Subject: TYPIC/OPERATIONAL
Activities Report, AMSTALK/1, Principal Agent for the ANTRUNK Team.

Action Required: For Your Information

1. Operational Activity:

A. During the period June-August 1966, AMSTALK/1 was instrumental in assisting in the preparation of the AMTRUNK Operational Team consisting of AMAKA/1, AMTRUNK/24, and ANTRUNK/25 for STEAMER IX and X, a two phase oporation targetted at southern Matanzas and Havana. During the final planning stages, however, it was decided to omit for the present the portion of the operation directed at Havana, and AMTRUNK/7, a former AMTRUNK Team guide on operations in the northern Matanzas area, was rehired specifically for the exfiltration phase of the STEAMER IX and X Operation. ADISTALK/1 was responsible for convincing AMTRUNK/7 to rejoin his former team, and arranged the necessary cover details which would explain AMTRUNK/7's absence from the JMWAVE area during the operation.

B. During July 1966, AMSTALK/1 attended the majority of the three week communications instructors course, but as the result of the press of business in preparing for the STEAMER Operation, was unable to complete the course; it is believed, however, that AMSTALK/1 could perform as a qualified instructor even though he did not receive his "diploma".

C. A part of AMSTALK/1's contribution to the STEAMER Operation was the extensive and comprehensive debriefing of refugees to the JMWAVE arca from the operational area. The information obtained from these reports was of value to the AMTRUNK Team in planning for the STEAMER Operation.

2. Operational Expenses:

Salary (June-August 1966 Gross) $1,476.00
Mileage (June-August 1966) 383.00

TOTAL $1,859.00

3. Intelligence Production:

AMSTALK/1 did not provide any disseminable reports during the period under review. He did, however, provide the Station with considerable operational information through his contacts in the local community, and through refugee leads provided by the Station.

4. Projected Plans:

STEAMER IX and X is planned for launching on 11 September 1966. AMSTALK/1 who has assisted in the planning phase, and who has provided the Station with the services of AMTRUK/25 and AMTRUNK/7 will accompany the ANTRUNK Team during its.travel to its infiltration point and during its return from its exfiltration point in order to provide on-the-spot guidance and support.

1. During late 1962 while still a member of the AMICE organization, AMICE-14 received some informal paramilitary training from JMWAVE. The cryptonym was assigned to him at that time.

2. Subject resigned from AMICE in March 1963 at which time he became a fully-recruited asset of Station JMWAVE. Subject has been associated with the MHAPRON-oriented AMTRUNK (STEAMER) project as Team Leader and Principal Agent since his resignation from AMICE.

3. Since Subject's activities for the past three years have been totally unrelated to those of AMICE, it is requested that his cryptonym be changed to forestall any further possible confusion between his current duties and the activities of his former parent organization.

4. In anticipation of a favorable reply to this request, the cryptonym AMICE-14 will be cancelled effective 15 March 66 and the new cryptosyn AMSTALK-1 assigned to the Subject of 201-307337 as of that date.

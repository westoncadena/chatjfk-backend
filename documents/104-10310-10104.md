One Agency officer was placed abroad under Lykes cover from 1961 to 1968. A second served under the same cover from 1953 to July 1962 before leaving the Agency to take a bona fide position with the company; he later agreed to assist the Agency as an intermittent source in Europe from 1964 to early 1967. A third officer was placed with Lykes in this country in 1961 and underwent training in anticipation of an overseas assignment; he was withdrawn the following year when the assignment abroad was canceled.

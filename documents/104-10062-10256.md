# DDO STAFF MEETING BRIEF #32

22 February 1978

1. DDCI

The DDCI attended this week's staff meeting. He spoke of his appreciation of being able to work directly with the Operations Directorate, an organization which he has known from the field. He said that when he was first offered the nomination of the post of Deputy Director, he thought of the Agency primarily in terms of his perceptions of this Directorate. He knew that its officers worked long hours, developed excellent contacts and produced top-flight reports working always with a strong sense of dedication. He is planning to have a series of briefings which will further acquaint him with the activities of the Directorate. Meanwhile he reaffirmed that he had an open door to persons who had problems or issues that they wished to bring directly to his attention.

On his first day on duty, Mr. Carlucci was thrown in direct confrontation with the Department over the State/ CIA Treaty. While the Department has expressed very strong emotion concerning this Treaty, the Deputy Director stands by the position that he expressed during his confirmation hearings. When asked by one Senator about the State/CIA relations, he said that he felt this relationship had been codified to the extent that this was possible and that it was now a matter for Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station to work out their own individual arrangements. He hopes that we will be able to find some way of diffusing this issue so that we may proceed to other more substantive issues such as internal reporting responsibilities, communications, and cover.

Specific cover problems were briefly discussed. The DDO promised to deliver to the DDCI a new inventory of those issues and situations where the Divisions are

encountering problems that they or the DDO had been unable to resolve with the Department. The DDCI agreed to take a look at this catalog of cover problems and asked that a special paper on cover problems in Africa be forwarded to him.

Mr. Carlucci spoke of the interest Congress has in imposing Hughes/Ryan type procedures on sensitive intelligence operations as well as covert action. He had pointed out two problem areas to the Senate Committee, i.e., the difficulty of defining what is a sensitive operation and the problems involved in providing sufficient background and detail to permit the SSCI to make informed judgments on individual operations.

2. Responses to Dr. Brzezinski's Letter

While Dr. Brzezinski has not replied to the letter sent earlier to him this month proposing the 32 key countries on which we would prepare new political reporting plans, we are working on the presumption that this list is acceptable to him. It is planned that we will include sensitive operational details in a separate annex. The plan will be coordinated with NFAC and the Department and then forwarded with the annex to Dr. Brzezinski.

3. Memoranda Addressed to DCI and DDCI

Memoranda addressed to the DCI and DDCI concerning their appointments with Ambassadors and Chiefs of Station should be in their offices at least three days prior to the scheduled appointment.

4. Reorganization of the Operations Directorate

The DDO presented his tentative plan for the reorganization of the Operations Directorate which he will discuss with the Director within a week.

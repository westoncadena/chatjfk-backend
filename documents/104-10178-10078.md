2. Caracas and Liani will recall that AMICD-31 covered the CLACC Council meeting in Dominican Republic, May 1966, and produced some useful and discernible intelligence. According to a recent report from Miami, AMICA-31 is now employed in Caracas at the Office of the Coordinator of Economic Affairs. We are checking into the status of his OA.

3. Meanwhile, perhaps Caracas Station would be considering the feasibility of contacting AMICA-31 to find out if he plans to attend the Quito conference and whether or not the Station could handle such a one-shot reporting assignment for AMICD-31, assuming his OA can be up-dated. We will cable his OA status as soon as possible.

*AMICE-31 invited to be delegate at ninth CLASC Consejo planned for May 13-17 in Santo Domingo. A-31 could be useful as reporter and/or action agent since he is opposed to CLASC alliance with Marxist groups and in opposition to Emilio Maspero.

**Based on recollection of A-31's previous performance at Bogota CLASC meeting, in which AMICE-31 seemed inclined to Maspero, Caracas sees little point in WOFIRM subsidizing A-31's trip this time, but defers action to Hqs and Santo Domingo.

OTHER JIDEVIL/1 REASON FOR SUCH A NOVE WOULD BE TO SE PHYSICALLY NEAPER TO AFFILIATES WHO ARE GIVING HIN SULL SUPPORT; I.E., CAP. ISSEAN AFF ILIATES.

8. FOR DIR PALP: IF WORD COULD REACH DUBOLD/1 AND HIS COHORTS THAT CISC AND CPASHEN NOT PACKING DOWN ON FUNDING ARRANGEMENT PROPOSED IN 19 NOV LETTER, IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY STRENGTHEN THEIR HAND IN OPEN OPPOSITION TO JNDEVIL.

9. FOR SAGO: I CONCURS AND SAGO ABLE TO PLACE ARTICLE INSINUATING THAT JNDEVIL/1 LIVING ABOVE HIS INCOME, BELIEVE IT WOULD PROVIDE FUEL FOR THE FLAMES BEING SPREAD BY DUBOLD/1 AND GROUP OPPOSED TO JNDEVIL/1.

4. NEW PROPOSED STATUTES THAT JMDEVIL WILL SUBMIT AT MEDELLIN (ATT TO REF B) CONTAIN SEVERAL TWISTS THAT APPEAR AIMED AT LIMITING AFFILIATE AUTHORITY AND INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION, PRESSURING ZRGANIN TO REVERSE ITS REF A STAND, AND STRENGTHENING JYDEVIL-1 EXECUTIVE CONTROL. WE VIEW FOLLOWING AS MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANCES THAT ASSETS SHOULD OPFCSE:

A. ARTICLE EIGHT G STIPULATES THAT ONLY JADEVIL CAN REPRESENT AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS IN RELATIONS WITH HEMISPHERIC AND INTERNATIONAL ENTITITES. STRICTLY INTERPRETED, THIS ARTICLE BLOCKS DIRECT AFFILIATE RELATIONS WITH ZRGANIN, THE GERMAN CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS (THRU THE INSTITUTE OR NO. SOLIDARITY) AND THE GERMAN BISHOPS. IF THIS ARTICLE APROVED JAMDEVIL-1 WOULD HAVE BASIS ARGUING THAT ZRGAMIN RESCIND ITS POSITION TO FUND AFFILIATES DIRECTLY, FOR SUCH ACTION WITHIN JMDEVIL.

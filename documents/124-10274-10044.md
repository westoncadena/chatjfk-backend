On September 25, 1959, Jaffe, who is a good friend of the Bureau and who did two radio shows on the New York Office, came by and talked with Kemper.

Jaffe has been on the Khrushchev trip, and he said it was the most hectic thing he has ever had to do in his life. He said there was no question about Khrushchev's anger in Los Angeles and that one of the aides told him, "Don't be surprised if the old man doesn't suddenly get up and go home." He said the security of Khrushchev was badly handled and that Roswell Garst, Coon Rapids, Iowa, the millionaire farmer, is no more than a publicity seeker and is a real "corn ball."

He said one amusing thing happened in San Francisco. At about 7:15 in the morning Khrushchev decided to take a walk and, apparently, caught his bodyguards flatfooted. He headed down the street with the guards streaming out the doors behind him, some of them buttoning their clothes as they ran.

Jaffe is trying to get back to Russia (CBS lost their correspondents after the television show that was critical of Stalin, et al.) and he has been working with people at the embassy to try and get back. He said that he wanted to go back and have a television interview with Khrushchev on his reaction to his trip and that he had been in touch with Viktor Osipov, who is a second secretary in the embassy and attached to the Cultural Section. He said that at the reception at the embassy on Thursday night, Osipov told him to submit his list of questions and he would see what they could do about getting him to Moscow to interview Khrushchev.

Jaffe said that he felt that the over-all trip by Khrushchev would be beneficial, particularly in case of a hot war because Khrushchev, having seen the country and the people, may hesitate before "pushing the button."

The private instruction would not preclude subject's associating with other Russian language students since it would be given at Columbia University and Miss would have various contacts among such students.

On 9/2/59, subject stated she was entirely willing to accompany to parties he will be invited to, given by the Diplomatic establishments in NYC; had expressed a willingness to take a female who is cooperating with the NYO to such parties.

SUBJECT:

This morning Kemper took a call from Mr. Sam Jaffe,
CBS News--Television, New York, Plaza 1-2345, Extension 7801.
He wanted to know if it would be possible to interview the Director
in connection with the current juvenile delinquency problem in
New York City. Kemper told Jaffe that the Director had a firm
policy in not injecting himself into local matters; and accordingly,
the Director could not comply with this request.

Jaffe then wanted to know if it would be possible to
interview SAC Foster on the problem of juvenile delinquency, but
that this interview would be general in nature and would not refer
to the specific New York problem, but would cover the broad
national picture.

Kemper advised Jaffe that again it would be injecting
the FBI into the local situation, and we did not deem this advisable.
Jaffe agreed. Kemper called SAC Foster and alerted him to Jaffe's
call and explained to him the reasons. Foster said that he would be
alert to keeping out of the situation as it developed in New York.

On 5/28/59, informant advised that an employee of the CBS received a letter from PETR EORISSOV in which BORISSOV

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 10

NY 134-3315

offered to pay all of this employee's expenses while he visited Russia, if this employee would pay his expenses to Russia. Informant advised that this individual met BORISSOV at the UN while BORISSOV was employed there in the Department of Public Information. Since BORISSOV'S return to Russia this employee was apparently in contact with him according to informant. Informant got this information secondhand and was not able to furnish this individual's name until 7/7/59. On 7/21/59, a Research Analyst on the staff of the CBS, appeared at the NYO and furnished information concerning his association with PETR PORISSOV, known Soviet Agent. is identical with the individual about whom informant furnished information and he is now being considered for development as an informant or double agent. He is going to Russia.

On 6/3/59, as a result of his contacts with Soviet Nationals, informant was able to shed some light on the rather sudden departure of VADIM BOGOSLOVSKI, Protocol Officer at the Soviet UN Delegation. Through his contacts among Soviet Nationals he learned that BOGOSLOVSKI was having family troubles and on 8/11/59, he learned that BOGOSLOVSKI did not expect to return to the US because of these family troubles.

On 7/7/59, informant advised that IMRE HOLLAI, Counselor of the Hungarian Delegation to the UN, was spending a vacation at Cape Cod in Massachusetts. HOLLAI is a known Hungarian Agent and this was the first information to come to the attention of this office concerning his travel to Cape Cod. This information resulted in appropriate investigation of HOLLAI in Cape Cod.

h. Approximate Number of Persons on Whom Informant Furnished Coverage and Their Importan ce

Approximately 28 individuals connected with the UN or Delegations to the UN. Many of these are known agents of the Soviets or the Satellites.

i. Informant's Potential for Advancement

Informant possesses good petential for advancement in the Soviet and Satellite field. He is aggressive and very capable of injecting himself into circles in which he has not been acquainted in the past on the basis of his occupation as a news reporter. To date, his acquaintance among Soviet and Satellite Nationals has been widening continuously.

j. Stability and Reliability

Informant's association with Soviet Nationals has been verified by sources of all types. The information he has furnished concerning Soviet Nationals has on many occasions been substantiated by information obtained from other sources. To date, information furnished by informant has been accurate and he has proved reliable in his dealings with this office.

Informant has not shown any sign of instability. He has, however, experienced marital difficulties during the past 8 months, which have caused him great concern. On 8/11/59, informant advised that his marital difficulties have about been resolved and his wife will obtain a divorce in the immediate future. Informant and his wife have reached an agreement in connection with their divorce.

k. Indoctrination Against Disclosure

Informant is most security conscious and has repeatedly stated that if it became known that he was furnishing information to the Bureau on a confidential basis his career as a news reporter would be jeopardized. Informant has been repeatedly advised of the necessity for maintaining the fact that he is furnishing information to the Bureau on a confidential basis in strictest confidence in the interest of the Bureau as well as himself.

ReNYairtel,7/8/59.

Informant's wife voluntarily stopped at the NYO
on 7/17/59. She said that in the course of a discussion
with informant she said something to cause informant to
think that she was going to tell the Russians that he was
talking to the FBI. She said that informant was quite
concerned about this and she presumed that the Bureau
would also be concerned.

Informant's wife said that it was at her
insistence that informant fuaticalled this office to advise
that they were seeing the Russians. Therefore, she was
aware that informant did furnish information to the FBI about
the Russians.

Informant's wife went on to say that she wanted to
assure the Bureau that she will never tell the Russians
or anyone else that informant has furnisned information
about the Russians to the FBI. Furthermore, she said
that she has not mentioned this to anyone including her
attorney.

Informant's wife was briefly acquainted with the Bureau's interest in the Soviets as this interest stems from the Bureau's jurisdiction in matters involving the internal security of the US. At the same time her attention was called to recent publicity appearing in the "NY Herald Tribune" about the Bureau's interest in the Soviets. She was also told that the Bureau wanted to be sure that its interest in the Soviets in no way interfered with the United Nations in its efforts to achieve the very worthy aims and purposes for which it was formed.

Informant's wife was most pleasant while at the New York Office and this office does not anticipate that any problems will arise in the handling of informant in the future as a result of his marital problems.

Developments in this matter will be called to the Bureau's attention.

CONF INFT,

SUBJECT:

Subject, Samuel Adason Jaffe, is Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) newsreporter. He has had extensive contact with Soviets in official news-gathering capacity since 1951. He has written articles for "The Nation." He was interviewed 9/12/58 and since that date has been furnishing information concerning his contact with four known Soviet-Satellite intelligence agents as well as other Soviet officials. Subject has been cooperative and participated in making a film for CBS in the New York Office in 1957. On 7/11/59 CBS TV carried a program during which subject narrated FBI Firearms and defensive tactics.

Subject has been having marital difficulties and has been living apart from his wife since 1/30/59. On 7/7/59 subject advised that his wife had retained an attorney and desired to obtain a divorce as soon as possible. Subject has also retained an attorney. Subject's wife refused to agree to a property settlement and on 6/30/59 threatened to tell the Soviets that subject is working with the FBI. Subject has indicated that he is concerned about this in view of the adverse effect it might have on his news career. Subject has been security conscious and in his news gathering capacity has had numerous official contacts with the FBI. Subject stated that his wife has knowledge of his contacts with the Bureau and with the Soviets. She does not know that subject has been furnishing information to the Bureau. Subject believes his wife may be making idle threats or may be making this statement in order to harm subject.

Subject is not involved in any intelligence operation. He does furnish good information concerning plans and thinking of top Soviet personnel at the United Nations. The New York Office has recommended that we continue contact with subject and not take steps to contact subject's wife, subject having indicated that he does not feel that his wife will carry out her threats. It is pointed out that subject has good official reasons to contact both the Soviets and the Bureau, and in view of his desire for security in connection with his reporting career, it appears we can safely continue contact with him.

RECOMMENDATION:

No further action at this time. New York will be allowed to maintain contact with the subject.

CONF, DFT,

As of 1/30/59, informant and his wife separated and have been living apart since that date.

Informant was interviewed on 7/7/59, at which time he advised that his wife has shown no inclination to obtain a divorce in a hurry until recently. He said that she has recently engaged the services of GEORGE KENNAN HOURWICH, Attorney, 14 Wall St., NYC. Informant has engaged the legal services of CHARLES H. LIEB, 19 Rector St., NYC.

Indices of this office do not contain any references which can be identified with LIEB. They do contain several references concerning HOURWICH.

"Who's Who of Russian Travellers for 1936," published by the OPEN ROAD, INC., 8 West 40th St., NYC, lists Mr. and Mrs. GEORGE HOURWICH, 55 East 86th St., NYC, as "independent travellers" in the Soviet Union for the year 1936.

LOUIS F. BUDENZ has described OPEN ROAD, INC., as a Communist created travel organization used in connection with securing transportation for Comrades between the U.S. and Russia.

"Who's Who in American Jewry" for the year 1938 to 1939, indicates that GEORGE KEENAN HOURWICH was born in Washington, D.C., on 11/19/04, attended Harvard University, Auslander Institute (Berlin), Sorbonne University (Paris) and Fordham University.

HOURWICH was the Secretary of READEX MICROPRINT CORP., This firm was in contact with Soviet and satellite officials and when officers of this firm were interviewed, they were cooperative. However, HOURWICH was not interviewed.

Report of SA FRANCIS X. PLANT, dated 1/10/45, in the case entitled, reflects that the subject of this case walked into the office of the law firm in which HOURWICH was a partner on 11/1/44. ,an Attorney, was an associate of ARTHUR ADAMS, prominent Soviet Espionage figure in the 1940s.

HOURWICH was also attorney for JOSEPH ISRAELS and had power of Attorney over ISRAELS' bank account, according to information set forth in the report of SA T. SCOTT MILLER, dated 3/7/47, at N.Y., captioned,

HOURWICH was also a contact of the League of American Artists and Writers.

Informant advised that through her attorney, his wife has expressed a desire to obtain a divorce immediately. Informant has agreed to give his wife a divorce providing she will give him $11,000 in bearer bonds, $5,000 for furniture in their apartment and pay attorney fees as well as agree to let informant see his children frequently. To this his wife has refused to agree.

On June 30, 1959, informant met his wife to discuss the matter of a settlement. During this discussion, informant's wife threatened to ruin informant at CBS (his employer), tell his children that he married her for her money when they grow up and to tell the Russians that he is working with the FBI. Informant said that he considered these to be idle threats on the part of his wife; however, he was very concerned about the effect his wife's threats would have on his career as a news reporter if she carried them out. Informant pointed out that he is very anxious to travel to Russia and China and possibly represent CBS in one of these countries at some future time. He said that he would never be permitted to travel to these countries if his wife ever said anything to the Russians about his talking to the FBI.

Informant has always been most security conscious about the possibility of it becoming known that he was furnishing information to the Bureau. However, as a news reporter with CBS, he has had open contact with this office

since at least 10/30/57, when he and a CBS camera crew made a feature film in the NYO. Informant said that his wife has been aware of the fact that he has been in contact with the Bureau and that he has been in contact with the Russians. However, she does not know that he has been furnishing information to the Bureau about the Russians on a continuing basis. Informant agreed that she may have assumed that he is doing this or that her threat to tell the Soviets that he is talking to the FBI indicated she would do this even if it were not true, in order to harm informant.

The voluntary aspect of informant's cooperation was called to informant's attention, as well as the fact that his cooperation must be on a strictly confidential basis at all times. Informant acknowledges that this had been repeatedly called to his attention. He was then asked if he wanted to continue to furnish information to the Bureau. Informant said that he has great respect for the Bureau and he feels duty bound to continue to furnish information to the Bureau about the Soviets. However, he reiterated a statement he has made in the past to the effect that he could not do anything other than furnish information.

Informant was told to bear in mind that he has had open contacts with this office and if he ever has occasion to explain his contacts with the Bureau, to do so on the basis of his news reporting activities. It was also suggested to informant that he refrain from bringing up the threats made by his wife in conversation with her, particularly the threat about telling the Russians he is talking to the FBI.

This office recommends that contact be continued with informant as he has furnished valuable information and is himself very security conscious and desirous of furnishing information to the Bureau. Consideration has been given to contacting informant's wife, however, this would only serve to confirm what she appears to have assumed and might possibly add impetus to the situation existing between informant and his wife. Should informant's wife carry out any or all of her threats, informant understands that his cooperation has been voluntary and will continue to be voluntary. Informant is of the opinion that his wife will not carry out her threats.

This office will follow this matter closely and keep the Bureau advised.

SUBJECT:

Informant was interviewed on 5/12/59 at which time he advised that it is fairly certain that he and his wife will be divorced and all possibilities of a reconciliation have been exhausted. Informant presumes that his wife will obtain the divorce in Reno, Nevada on a date as yet undetermined. Informant does not anticipate any scandal in connection with the divorce nor does he anticipate any publicity unless it results from the inability of he and his wife to resolve the problem of custody of their children.

During this interview, the informant advised that he is still desirous of travelling to Red China as a news reporter and toward this end he has written to the Chinese Legation in London and forwarded three copies of "Face of Red China", a pamphlet prepared by CBS concerning a television presentation of the same name. In reply, he received a letter from the Third Secretary of the Chinese Legation, who advised him that he was forwarding two copies of "Face of Red China" to Peking and he was reapplying for a visa for the informant.

This Bureau will be kept advised of developments in these matters.

The informant was interviewed on April 28, 1959, at which time he advised that he completed reading the article concerning the FBI in the October 18, 1958 issue of "The Nation". The informant said that he was very unimpressed with the content of the article and was, of course, well aware of the fact that it contained a mass of untrue information.

However, the informant said that he was not personally acquainted with FRED J. COOK, the author, and could not possibly be aware of the motive COOK might have had for writing the article. The informant did express the opinion that COOK must have thought that an article such as this would benefit him financially although he does not know this to be true.

However, the informant said that the article is indicative of the thinking of CAREY MC WILLIAMS, Editor of, "The Nation", and "The Nation's" Publisher, GEORGE G. KERSTEIN. The informant expressed the belief that MC WILLIAMS and KERSTEIN would publish any article which attacked the Bureau, the House on Un-American Activities Committee, and almost any other government organization.

This office has considered obtaining a signed statement of cooperation from the informant. It is not believed that it would be advisable to obtain such a signed statement from the informant, inasmuch as the informant is a news reporter employed by the Columbia Broadcasting System.

Informant has furnished voluminous information concerning Soviet and satellite personel with whom he is acquainted, which would not have come to the Bureau's attention were it not for informant.

On 9/12/58, informant mentioned that the CBS monitors police and Fire Department radio transmissions, and has occasionally monitored FBI radio transmissions for the purpose of obtaining possible leads for news stories.

i. Informant's Potential for Advancement

Informant is in a good position to continually meet additional Soviet and satellite personnel, thereby increasing his value to the Bureau.

j. Stability and Reliability

Information furnished by informant has been found to be reliable. Much of this information has been substantiated by other live sources who have, on occasion, furnished the same information as informant, or who have furnished information with respect to informant's contacts with individuals about whom he has subsequently furnished information. Information furnished by the informant with respect to movement of certain individuals have proved reliable, based upon known activities of these individuals.

Informant has shown no signs of instability, however, informant does have personal problems involving marital difficulties which have caused him great concern of late. He has been separated from his wife since 1/30/59; and in spite of his desire to effect a reconciliation, his wife is not interested in this. No legal action has been started by informant or his wife, at this time, however, a divorce will probably be sought by informant's wife in the not too distant future.

k. Indoctrination Against Disclosure

The informant has been repeatedly reminded of the necessity for keeping his relationship with the Bureau in strictest confidence. Informant in turn has repeatedly expressed utmost concern about the possibility that it might become known that he was furnishing information to the Bureau. Informant has said that if this became known, it would jeopardize his career as a news reporter.

Informant vas interviewed on 3/25/59, at which time he advised that his marital difficulties have not been resolved and in recent conversations with his wife she told him that she had been seeing another man while married to him. Informant does not know the identity of this other man and inspite of this he is still willing to reconcile his differences with his wife in the interests of his children. No legal action has been started by either informant or his wife, Although informant has considered seeking the advice of an attorney, he has not been able to effect a reconciliation in a reasonable time.

Informant does not show any signs of instability and to date he has proven to be reliable. However, he does show some concern for his children and is obviously upset over his marital difficulties. This office will keep abreast of matters pertaining to difficulties between informant and his wife and the Bureau will be kept advised.

NYlet to Bureau dated 2/16/59, reflects that the informant was given a copy of the 10/18/58 issue of "The Nation" on 2/12/59. This issue of this magazine contained an article concerning the FBI, written by FRED J. COOK, in an apparent effort to "smear" the Bureau. Informant has been contacted on several occasions since he was given this article to read and on both occasions he advised that he has not been able to complete this article. He has always requested permission to keep the article so that he might finish reading it. Comments concerning the article will be solicited from informant when he completes reading it and the Bureau will be advised.

JAFFE was interviewed on 2/12/59, by SAS JOHN F. MABEY and EDWARD F. GAMBER. During this interview, JAFFE advised that as of 1/30/59, he moved out of the apartment which he and his family shared.

SUBJECT: SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE, aka

ReBulet, 1/28/59

JAFFE was interviewed by SAS JOHN F. MABEY and EDWARD F. GAMBER on 2/12/59. (JAFFE's identity should be protected.) As usual, JAFFE was most pleasant and cooperative.

During the interview, JAFFE was casually asked if he had read the article about the FBI in the 10/18/58 issue of "The Nation." The introduction of this topic into the interview was very casual and the exact date of the issue in which the article appeared was not actually mentioned. JAFFE said that he did not read this article nor had he heard about the article. Interviewing Agents then told JAFFE that the article was written in an apparent effort to "smear" the Bureau. The Agents commented that the Bureau always welcomes constructive criticism, and upon receipt of same, has always taken expeditious stops to make any warranted changes in its operations. However, the article appearing in "The Nation" contained no constructive criticism and in fact, the criticism contained therein was based on untruths, erroneous conclusions, and biased innuendoes.

JAFFE said that he would like very much to read this article and asked who the author was. When the name of FRED J. COOK was mentioned, it meant nothing to JAFFE, but when JAFFE was told that COOK wrote for the "New York World Telegram and Sun," he expressed amazement. Interviewing Agents expressed idle interest in knowing whatever provoked the writing and publication of such an article and this evoked from JAFFE the comment that CAREY MC WILLIAMS, editor of "The Nation," was undoubtedly the moving facte behind such an article appearing in "The Nation." He said that CAREY MC WILLIAMS is violently anti-Bureau, was anti-"McCarthy", is anti-House Un-American Activities

Committee, anti-Secretary of State JOHN FOSTER DULLES, and anti just about everything. He said that MC WILLIAMS is a fanatical and extreme liberal.

JAFFE hastened to explain during this conversation that he was never a staff employee of "The Nation" but that he was employed by "The Nation" on a temporary basis. He said that he has not had any contact with "The Nation" or its employees or officials since he left his temporary employment with this publication. However, when JAFFE went to work at the Columbia Broadcasting System, where he is now employed as a news reporter, he gave CAREY MC WILLIAMS as a reference.

In a further discussion of "The Nation", JAFFE said that "The Nation" was at one time published by FREIDA KIRSHWAY, but that she now acts in an advisory capacity to this publication. She sold the publication to an individual named KERSTEIN, according to JAFFE, and JAFFE believes that this individual is associated with the Federated Department Stores in Boston, Mass. It is JAFFE's belief that this man's resources provide the sole source of financial backing for "The Nation."

"The Nation" lists as its publisher GEORGE G. KERSTEIN. is the subject of Bureau file 100-998.

In connection with our interest in learning who is behind the "smear campaign," highlighted by the article appearing in the 10/18/58 issue of "The Nation," this office is going to make a copy of this issue available to JAFFE so that he can read it. In this way, it is felt that further comments from JAFFE concerning the article and the people behind "The Nation" will be spontaneously brought forth in subsequent interviews with him.

Inquiry concerning "The Nation" was made during an interview with JAFFE which encompassed some casual conversation, as well as inquiry concerning his association with Soviet nationals. JAFFE's reaction to the casual inquiry about "The Nation" was such that no possible embarrassment to the Bureau can result. He is most cooperative and anxious to assist the Bureau.

The Bureau will be kept advised.

Reurlet dated January 15, 1959.

Authority granted to continue contacts with Jaffe
for development as a potential security informant. This
should be handled in accordance with Section 107, Manual of
Instructions.

The Bureau considers subject to be of interest to
the Soviets and has authorized continued contact with him
in view of his apparent potential as a source against the
Soviets. The Bureau has followed closely information furnished
by Jaffe and it appears he is progressing satisfactorily and
is in a logical position to furnish us information of interest
concerning our coverage of the Soviets. It is desired that
this phase of his development be carefully followed on a
continuing basis.

The Bureau has been alert to the potential value
that subject might have since the publication of the article
"The FBI" in the October 16, 1953, issue of "The Nation." In
view of subject's cooperation with the Bureau and his respect
for, interest in and appreciation of the confidential nature
of the Bureau's work, you are authorized to discreetly and
tactfully bring up the subject of "The Nation" in an early
contact with subject for the purpose of determining his
reaction to the above article. If Jaffe appears inclined to
discuss this article, you should guide the discussion in the
initial interview or subsequent contacts to ascertain who
on "The Nation" staff is behind the "smear campaign" high-
lighted by above article. Two experienced agents familiar
with press relations matters should handle interview when
"The Nation" is first brought up. Obviously, at least one
Agent must be one who has handled the development of Jaffe but
in view of possible ramifications Bureau desires both be
conversant with over-all need for good press relations.

SUBJECT: SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE, aka. ReNYlet, 11/4/58

JAFFE was initially interviewed on 9/12/58, and subsequent to that time he was interviewed on 11/6, 12/12,4, 10,31/58 and 1/9/59. During these interviews he has been most cooperative, and has furnished information concerning numerous Soviet and Satellite Nationals with whom he is acquainted. His acquaintance with these people stems from his employment as a news reporter with the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), in which capacity he feels that he needs news sources in Soviet and Satellite circles. Included among his acquaintances are the following Soviet Nationals:

NIKOLAI S. KALININ, known Soviet intelligence agent.

VLADIMIR P. SUSLOV, known Soviet intelligence agent.

VLADIMIR B. BARKOVSKY, known Soviet intelligence agent.

VADIM A. BOGOSLOVSKI, potential Soviet defector.

JAFFE is the recipient of invitations to social functions at the homes of Soviet nationals and at the Soviet UN Delegation. He in turn entertains Soviet nationals at his home.

JAFFE's acquaintance with VLADIMIR B. BARKOVSKY is of such a nature that it might possibly result in a double agent operation. BARKOVSKY has made inquiry of JAFFE concerning individuals, groups and business firms on the West Coast of the United States who were interested in seeing trade restrictions placed on trade with Red China eased. JAFFE furnished some information concerning this to BARKOVSKY, and the extent to which BARKOVSKY's inquiries along this line will go are not as yet known. BARKOVSKY also asked JAFFE to put in writing his impressions and analysis of the political scene in the US, and told JAFFE that he would pay him for doing this. JAFFE refused the offer.

On 11/14/58, advised that during the week prior to 11/14/58, JAFFE was sitting at a table in the North Delegates lounge at the UN Secretariat in the company of ERNESTO DE LOSSA of the Panama Delegation to the UN and FRANK R. BEGLEY, a US staff member at the UN Secretariat. After leaving. JAFFE and BEGLEY, DE LOSSA told source that BEGLEY warned him to be careful of JAFFE, because he was suspected of being a Communist. This is only source from which any information was obtained indicating that JAFFE was suspected of being a Communist. Investigation did reveal that JAFFE was at one time a correspondent for "The. Nation"

Bulet 11/21/58, in instant matter, states that in any contacts which this office has with JAFFE, agents should be alert to any information indicating that he has contacts presently on the staff of "The Nation", or knowledge of any individuals employed there with. This letter further states that pror to bringing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 42

NY 134-3315

this subject up with JAFFE, recommendations regarding contact with JAFFE on this subject should be submitted to the Bureau upon completion of the remaining lead in the background investigation of subject. Bulet 12/2/58, sets forth information with respect to JAFFE's former association with "The Nation", and states that the letter is not intended to create/impression that this office should bring up the question of "The Nation" in its discussion with him.

The WFO has not as yet advised this office of the results of its check of CIA files for information concerning JAFFE. Accordingly, this office has not submitted any recommendation regarding contact with JAFFE concerning "The Nation" However, in course of contacts with JAFFE, he has stated that in his employment with the CBS, he is prohibited from writing articles for any newspaper or magazine, or doing work for any other organization without the express permission of CBS. Therefore, it does not appear that JAFFE is presently affiliated with "The Nation" in any respect.

It is obvious through conversations which 'interviewing agents have had with JAFFE that he has the utmost respect for the Bureau, and is extremely interested in the Bureau's work. He has had contacts with Bureau personnel on matters related to his position as a news reporter with CBS, and he has spoken of these contacts in a manner reflecting the utmost respect for the personnel with whom he has had contact. He shows a sincere appreciation for the confidential nature of the Bureau's work, and speaks of the very professional manner in which he has found Bureau agents conducting themselves as compared to representatives of other law enforcement agencies with whom he is in contact.

If the Bureau so desires, this office believes that the subject of "The Nation" could be discreetly and tactfully brought up in the course of a conversation with JAFFE. This may then be discussed in a conversational vein serving the purpose of exploring JAFFE's present knowledge of the staff of "The Nation". This subject will not be brought up with JAFFE in the absence of Bureau permission.

Every opportunity has been taken to acquaint JAFFE with the fact that his relationship with the Bureau must be held in strictest confidence at all times. JAFFE has made known the fact on repeated occasions that information which he furnishes to the Bureau must be handled in strictest confidence, since if it became known that he were furnishing information to the Bureau, his position as a news reporter would be jeopardized. JAFFE has been told to use the facilities of a public pay station when telephonically contacting this office, and that he should not have any personal contact at the NYO. However, these latter instructions were qualified to the extent that if in his position as a news reporter it is necessary for him to contact 'this office concerning matters other than those on which he is furnishing information to this office, he must of course feel free to do so. JAFFE has been told he is not to consider himself to be an employee of the Bureau and that his cooperation with the Bureau is to be on a voluntary basis at all times. The Bureau's labor policy was explained to JAFFE inasmuch as he is a member of a labor union.

JAFFE has been told that; under no circumstances would the fact that he is cooperating with the Bureau in furnishing information to the Bureau, place him in the position of receiving preferential treatment

NW 88326 Docld:32989704 Page 43

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 44

NY 134-3315

when news releases were made by the Bureau. He was advised that an inquiry which he might make through this office in connection with his employment should be made through normal channels, and not through agents to whom he is furnishing information. JAFFE fully understands that he is not to be the recipient of any personal consideration in matters of public interest being investigated by the Bureau. Furthermore, he fully understands the necessity for this, and at no time has indicated that he expected to be the recipient of any personal favors.

Inasmuch as JAFFE is being contacted on a rather regular basis, and has been found to be most cooperative, this office desires to take steps to develop him as a *PSI*. It is noted that some steps along this line have already been taken in order to capitalize on existing situations, as well as JAFFE's very favorable attitude concerning these situations.

Bureau permission is requested for this office to develop JAFFE as a *PSI*.

This is an effort on the part of CBS to restore itself to the good graces of the Soviets. It is noted that CBS no longer has any representation in Moscow since their correspondent was forced to leave Moscow at the request of the Soviets.

JAFEE told this to BARKOVSKY and asked BARKOVSKY if he could arrange an interview for him with MIKOYAN. BARKOVSKY told JAFFE that it would to impossible for him to arrange an interview for JAFFE with MIKOYAN, inasmuch as he represents CBS.

BARKOVSKY said that he would, however, endeavor to obtain an invitation for JAFFE to a reception which may be given for MIKOYAN. BARKOVSKY also asked JAFFE when CBS was going to do something to restore themselves in the good graces of the Soviets. JAFFE, other then telling BARKOVSKY about the film being made of MIKOYAN's visit to the US, knew of no other effort being made by CBS along these lines.

Concerning JAFFE's desire to interview MIKOYAN, and the invitation which he would try to get for JAFFE to a reception which might be given for MIKOYAN, BARKOVSKY said that the decision would be made by a press

Re:

An informant, who is in a position to furnish reliable information, advised that subject and his wife visited his home on the evening of December 31, 1958, arriving at approximately 8:30 p.m., and departing at approximately 11:45 p.m. In addition to the subject and his wife, Nikolai S. Kalinin was also present. Subject brought informant and his wife a pictorial book on Russia.

During the evening, Barkovsky told informant that Deputy Soviet Premier Anastas I. Mikoyan may visit San Francisco, California, and he wanted the informant to suggest several groups before whom Mikoyan might speak in California. Informant told subject that the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco had among its members all of the foremost citizens in the San Francisco community, and he would suggest, if possible, Mikoyan speak before this club, as well as the San Francisco Press Club.

Informant also took the opportunity to tell subject that in a recent conversation with his father on the telephone, he asked his father about the identity of business concerns on the West Coast of the United States desirous of doing business with Red China

It is noted that while informant was in subject's company on December 5, 1958, he asked informant for information concerning business concerns on the West Coast of the United States desirous of doing business with Red China.

The informant told subject that his father furnished him the names of several individuals who have spoken in favor of trade with Red China.

Most of the conversation at informant's home on the evening of December 31, 1958, was of a social nature, however, subject showed a definite interest in the information which informant gave to him about business concerns interested in trade with Red China, and accordingly, informant arranged to have lunch with subject on January 5, 1.959.

On January 5, 1959, informant did have lunch with subject, and subject again brought up the matter of Mikoyan's visit to San Frandsco, and asked informant for some background information on the clubs which he mentioned. Informant told subject that he conversed with his father on the telephone, over the weekend, and his father agreed that Mikoyan would do well to speak before the Commonwealth Club and the San Francisco Press Club.

Subject asked informant about the Union League Club in San Francisco, and informant told him that this club merged with the San Francisco Press Club, although not all members of this club are members of the Press.

He told subject that the Union League Club was one of the best clubs in San Francisco, and that it and the Commonwealth Club have as members all of the influential people in San Francisco. Subject told informant that he would pass this information to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., but that for the most part, the Soviets were relying on Eric Johnston, President of the Motion Picture Association of America, when arranging Mikoyan's activities.

Subject told informant that the Soviets still owned property in San Francisco, which he believed


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 51

to include a building. It was the subject's opinion that somebody from Washington, D.C. would accompany Mikoyan for the purpose of inspecting this property, inasmuch as the Soviets did not get an opportunity to visit San Francisco too often. Subject mentioned to informant that he traveled through San Francisco on his way from Japan to Russia during World War II.

During lunch, subject asked informant about the information he had obtained concerning business concerns on the WestCoast of the United States desirous of doing business with Red China.

Informant verbally repeated what he had told the subject on the evening of December 31, 1958, mentioning that there were over 700 organizations in the San Francisco area who favored trade with China. At subject's request, informant wrote on a piece of paper, the names of individuals who have spoken in favor of trade with Red China.

The names which he wrote on the paper were those of James P. Wilson, Manager of the World Trade Department of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce; George E. Talmage, Vice President of Pacific Transport Line and States Lines; John S. Bolles, Head of the Chamber of Commerce's Industry Committee and Malcolm W. Boyd, Assistant Publisher of the "Pacific Shipper".

In addition, informant told subject that "The Dispatcher", official organ of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union endorsed a policy favorable to trade with Red China.

Subject told informant that trade with Red China would help the United States by increasing trade between the United States and Russia, as the Russians would much rather pick up goods on the West Coast of the

United States than to pick these goods up elsewhere.. He made no further request of informant for information concerning business concerns desirous of doing business with Red China.

During lunch, subject also asked informant what the reaction in the United States has been to the visit of Mikoyan. Informant told subject that it is too early to tell, as we do not even know why Mikoyan is here. He told subject that there was too much of a mystery surrounding Mikoyan's visit and subject then asked informant if there was not any reaction at all. Informant told Barkovsky that there was none of which he was aware.

The records of the United States Department of State reflect that Vladimir Borisovich Barkovsky, a Soviet National, is Counselor to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations.

The records of the United States Department of State reflect that Nikolai Sergeevich Kalinin, a Soviet National, is a translator assigned to the United Nations Secretariat.

On this occasion subject's interest in ascertaining information with respect to business concerns on the West Coast of the United States desirous of doing business with Rod China was discussed with JAFFE.

JAFFE toid subject that his father was in the Hawaiian Islands and would not return until the middle of next year.

JAFFE advised that his father has returned to San Fr.metsco and he has talked with him on the phone. He suggested that he could tell the subject that he asked his father about business concerns on the West Coast desirous of doing business with Red China while conversing with him on the phone.

with Red China and then tell the subject that he spoke with his father on the phone and learned that most of the foreign traders in San Francisco desired to have the embargo against trade with Red China lifted or at least relaxed.

JAMES P. WILSON, Manager of the World Trade Department of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce; GEORGE E. TALMAGE, JR., Vice-President of Pacific Transport Line and States Lines; JOHN S. BOLLES, Head of the Chamber of Comerce's Industries Committee, and MALCOLM W. BOYD, Assitant Fublisher of the "Pacific Shipper", have all spoken in favor of Red China. In addition, "The Dispatcher", official organ of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union endorses a policy favorable. to trade with Red China.

The above information was furnished to the Bureau and this office in San Francisco letter, 12/23/58, and is all available from public sources. It will be furnished to subject verbally by JAFFE for the purpове of exploring subject's interest in the matter and possibly provoking a further request for information from subject.

It should be noted that JAFFE has been reminded that his cooperation with the Bureau is on a strictly voluntary basis and that he has been constantly reminded of the necessity for maintaining his relationship with the Bureau in strict confidence.

On 12/31/58, JAFFE advised that NIKOLAI S. KALININ, was at his home on Christmas Eve along with members of JAFFE's family. One of these members of JAFFE's family was IRVING KAHN, who is a member of the brokerage firm of J. R. Williston and Company and also on the

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

NY 65-15026

Board of Directors of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea
Company (A & P). During the evening in conversation
with KAEN, KALININ told KAHM that MIKOYAN,
Deputy Soviet Premier, would like to observe the opera-
tion of a large food store chain during his forthcoming
visit to the United States, and he, KALININ, was wondering
if KAHN could arrange to have MIKOYAN meet the president
of the A & P as well as observe the operations of this
firm. KAHN told KALIMIN that he thought this could be
arranged. Subsequent to his conversation with CALININ,
KAHN told JAFFE about it and expressed his intention
to see if he could arrange to fulfill MIKOYAN's desire
as expressed by KALININ. KALI will keep JAFFE advised
of any arrangements which he makes and JAFFE will in
turn immediately advise this office.

This office does not believe that KALININ, as
a translator assigned to the United Nations Secretariat,
holds a position in which he would be permitted to make
arrangements for any activities of MIKOYAN while MIKOYAN
is in the United States. KALININ is not known to be
an exceptionally intelligent or polished individual and
it is unlikely that he will be one of the Soviet Nationals
closely associated with MIKOYAN while MIKOYAN is in the
United States. Accordingly, the above information has not
been included in a memorandum suitable for dissemination;
however, if in the future more concrete information with
respect to KALININ's efforts to arrange a visit for
MIKOYAN to the A & P comes to the attention of this office,
it will be included in a memorandum suitable for dissemina-
tion.

The Bureau will be kept advised.

It was the original intention of this office to request Bureau authority to contact for the purpose of developing him as an informant in the field.

also true, however, that Soviet nationals engaged in intelligence operations are trained to be as observant as JAFFE obviously is. In view of this, it is logical to assume that there must be other persons, including Soviet nationals, who believe that If this is true, his value in the field is considerably lessened.

It is the intention of this office to consider as a potential confidential source in view of his many and varied contacts among UN personnel.

Notwithstanding this fact, it is believed that will be of value to us in our continuing efforts to obtain information of value relating to the activities of Soviet and Soviet-bloc officials as such activities relate to intelligence operations.

MR. stated that as a result of his current association
with these officials, he believen that almot all favor some trade

a lucrative market. MR. added that it was his recollection
that the "Daily Commercial Nows," a trade journal published in

advocating trade with Red China.

The World Trade Division, San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, maintains a file containing news releases concerning trade with Rod China. An article appearing in the "San Francisco Chronicle, Sunday, June 9, 1957, by JACK FOISIE, entitled "Local Traders Want to End Red China Ban." The fist paragraph of this article is as follows: "This City's 730 foreign traders are mounting pressure on the EISENHOWER Administration to end, or at least relax, the ombargo against trade with Communist China, import-export leaders said yesterday." Faragraph nine of this article states GEORGE E. TALMAGE, JR., Vice President of Pacific Transport Line States Linen, apeaking as President of the San Francisco Area World Trade Association, favors trade with Red China. (u)

Another release dated Thursday, 4/11/57, stated "Relaxation of the U.S. Government's Embargo policy regardingtrade with Red China was urged today by MALCOLM W. BOYD, Assistant Publisher of the Pacific shipper, at a luncheon held at the Fairmont Hotel by the San Francisco Area World Trade Association, San Francisco Chamber of Commerce affiliate.(u

"BOYD charged 'there is too much emotion involved in the Goverment's policy in Eastern Asia. It's a question which should be decided on fact, not emotion.

"The present policy may or may not be a correct one,' he added, 'but the decision about it should not be based on likes and dislikes.'

"POYD said 'the electorate of the country' is entitled to more accurate information from U.S. Government sources. We are too dependent on Chinese propaganda and reports of foreign businessmen touring China because the State Department won't allow American newsmen to enter the country.

"We should put the heat on our own Goverment to get non-military facts about what is going on in China.

"The State and Defense Departments won't tell us the extent of shipping calling at Chinese ports,' he continued, 'consequently, we're fumbling in the dark for the facts.'

"BOYD said that the list of European and Japanese shipping companies doing business in Chinese Mainland ports 'Reada like a mantime blue book.' He warned that a continued U.S. embargo means 'forfeiture of trade to the British and Scandinavians if and when the time comes that the embargo is lifted, at least for non-strategic materials."

"U.S. Naval Intelligence figures were cited for March,
1956. Out of 183 non-comunist registered vessels' grossing
1,130,560 tons in trade to and from the Chinese Mainland, 59 were
British vessels, 15 Japanese and the rest European, BOYD pointed
out. By October, 1956 the number of ships had grown to 214 a month,
he said. Of these, 43 vessels were British, 24 Japanese and the
rest European.

"We trade with Russia and the satellites, why not
China?", BOYD asked.

"You cannot ignore the world's most populated country
forever. Forever is a very, very long time."

Another release dated Tuesday, January 7, 1958, stated
"Unless the United States lifts ite embargo and recognizes Red
China it will forfeit control of Asia to the Soviets, JIM
ROBINSON, NBC news correspondent in Tokyo, warned a meeting of
the San Francisco Area World Trade Association of the San Francisco,
Chamber of Commerce today during a luncheon at the Fairmont Hotel.

"While the Chinese have had little love for the West
there is still time to woo them away from the Russians," he
continued.

"To do this the U.S. State Department must be realistic
and face up to the fact that the Government of Communist China is
a going concern and that China, with 640 million mouths to feed,
has had only Russia to turn to because of the trade embargo.

"It is an illusion to believe that China is seething
with revolt and that an invasion by the Chinese Nationalists would
bring the Communist regime to its knees."

"Red China's so-called allegiance to Moscow is scaled
to her dependency on the Russians for food and machinery."

"Breaking the U.S. embargo would counterbalance
Russia's influence greatly.!".

U.S. Bureau of Customs, San Francisco, advise the present
embargo prohibits any American vessel to visit Red China ports.
Exporters to Red China must apply for an export license through
the Bureau of Foreign Commerce, Washington, D.C., and any imports
must be approved by Foreign Funds Control Section, Federal Reserve

no U.S. trade with Red China at the present time.

On 11/6/58, subject asked JAFFE if he could ascertain the feeling of American business and American industry toward Red China and apprise him of this feeling.

The San Francisco Division is requested to furnish this office and the Bureau with information concerning business firms or groups on the West Coast who, through organizations or political activities, have made known their desire to have trade with Red China authorized by appropriate government agencies. It is further requested that the San Francisco Division furnish this office and the Bureau with any information contained in its files concerning business organizations on the West Coast doing business with Red China.

It would be most desirable to have the information requested available from public sources and accordingly, the San Francisco Division should furnish the sources of all of the information which it forwards to this office and the Bureau.

ReBulet 11/21/58 which authorized your continued contacts with subject pending completion of background investigation. As indicated in relet the Bureau does not desire that you initiate conversation with Jaffe concerning the "Nation" and this letter contains additional information of significance in the event a discussion concerning the "Nation" should rise during contact of subject by agents of your office.

A review of "Readers' Guide To Periodical Literature" shows that subject wrote five articles which were published in the "Nation" between 12/29/51 and 8/6/55. He has apparently had nothing published in the "Nation" since 8/6/55. It is noted that in WFO letter 11/20/58 subject indicated by letter dated 2/22/57 that he desired to travel to foreign countries to gather information for "news gathering organizations like CBS News, Worldwide Press Service and the Nation." In view of this statement by subject it appears that he may still have some contacts with the staff of the "Nation."

For your information subject's articles in the "Nation" are as follows:

(1) 12/29/51 "Uncle Sam's Bitter Nephews."
Article discusses marine reservists being called to active duty and serving in the Korean Conflict. A footnote indicates subject was New York newspaperman who spent eight months in Korea as combat correspondent with the First Marine Division.

(2) 5/7/55 "Chou En-lai Talks To The West."
This article reports subject's interview with Red China's premier on 4/25/55. Subject is described in a footnote as the "Nation's" special correspondent-assigned to cover the

Bandung Conference. The footnote indicated subject had
spent several years in the Far East. This article contains
a statement that Chou Chang-pu, personal secretary and
interpreter to Chou En-lai, a graduate of Harvard University,
asked subject whether Freda Kirchwey was still editor of
the "Nation."

(3) 6/25/55 "Dilemma In Saigon, Which Way
Democracy?" Article discusses American relations with
Vietnam and subject concludes that if we lose Vietnam,
we shall have lost all Asia. A footnote describes subject
as the "Natiots" roving correspondent in Southeast Asia.

(4) 7/9/55 "Buddhist Reformer: The Philosophy
Of U Nu." Article discusses U Nu, Prime Minister of
Burma and in footnote subject is again described as
roving correspondent in the Far East.

(5) 8/6/55 "Nestive Malaya, Driving For
Independence." Article discusses British activities
and Communist terrorists and in footnote subject is again
referred to as the "Nation's" roving correspondent.

By letter dated 11/17/58
furnished the following information which must not be
disseminated outside the Bureaus

On 10/7/58 subject wrote to the Red Chinese
Ambassador in Moscow referring to subject's interview with
Chou En-lai and generally requested assistance in arranging
travel to Red China. Subject indicated he had learned that
another reporter had traveled to Red China via the Soviet
Union. This information indicates subject is making
considerable effort to travel to Red China and the Bureau
is aware that subject has indicated this in his conversation
to agents of your office.

A further review of Bufiles reveals that by
letter dated 2/26/48 subject inquired concerning a position
in the Bureau. He stated that he was only nineteen years
old but had been doing newspaper work as a reporter on

crime for two years. He stated that he had been in the United States Merchant Marines for two years before that. He indicated that he was attending night school at the University of California and planned to take law later. He indicated he would like to become an agent of the FBI. He inquired concerning a clerical position working with agents to develop a better understanding of investigative work. Subject's letter was answered 5/6/48. There is no indication that he made further inquiry or ever filed application. This is furnished to you for additional background information as it is believed to be an indication of possible interest and significance in your contacts with him.

67-432170

The purpose of this letter is to furnish you additional background concerning subject's contact with the "Nation" and it is not intended to create the impression that you should bring up this question with him in your discussions. This is being furnished to you for your guidance in dealing with subject as the Bureau feels that subject does have good potential and has a background that would appear to be of sufficient interest to the Soviets that their contacts with him might be an excellent source of information for us.

NOTE: Subject is being considered as potential security informant and Bureau has previously approved additional contacts with informant pending completion of one additional lead to check CIA records. Subject is presently CBS News reporter and has been in frequent contact with numerous Soviets and has furnished information of significance. He has excellent potential and above is being furnished to NY for their guidance in view of subject's past contact with the "Nation."

Jaffe is Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) news reporter in New York who has had extensive contact with Soviets as representative of news-gathering media since 1951. He desired to travel to Red China and Soviet Russia as representative of "Life" and "Time" magazines in 1954. He contacted representatives of the Soviet Embassy on this occasion and a representative of "Time" and "Life" indicated Jaffe had thought that he had been surveilled by the FBI. On 2-23-55, Jaffe corresponded with the State Department on the letterhead of "The Nation" concerning proposed travel. On 9-5-55 Jaffe indicated to a confidential source that he was permanent correspondent of "The Nation" on the West Coast. On 1-3-56 Jaffe was interviewed by Bureau Agents at his request and furnished information concerning his efforts to travel to China and Russia. There is no indication that Jaffe made this trip as the result of his contacts with the Soviets at that time.

On 10-30-57 Jaffe and a CBS camera crew made a feature film in our New York Office which was telecast in two parts over certain CBS affiliate stations on 11-13 and 14-57. Jaffe was in charge of making this film. He reciprocated the cooperation shown him by the Bureau in making this film.

On 7-23-58 Jaffe contacted our New York Office and advised that he was inviting two Soviets to dinner that date. Informant advised at that time that Jaffe was in frequent contact with the Protocol Officer of the Soviet Delegation to the United Nations (UN). By letter 8-28-58 Bureau approved preliminary interview of Jaffe to determine his attitude toward the Bureau for cooperation in connection with his knowledge and contact of Soviets in New York.

Jaffe was interviewed 9-12-58 and was extremely cooperative. He talked at length concerning his association and knowledge of five Soviets, two of whom are known intelligence agents and one considered a potential defector. Jaffe advised that his uncle, an actor, Samuel Charles Jaffe, was active on behalf of Russian war relief and sympathized with what proved to be communist inspired organizations. He has been interviewed by Bureau Agents. He was cooperative, denying membership in the Communist Party, but admitted membership in 14 communist front organizations.

Memorandum for Mr. Belmont
RE: SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE, aka.
105-28333

Background investigation of Jaffe was instituted as a result of his interview on 9-12-58. No derogatory information has been developed and it appears that all of his contacts with the Soviets have been as the result of his news-gathering assignments. The New York Office, aware of the additional significance of Jaffe's former association with "The Nation," since publishing the article entitled "The FBI," in the 10-18-58 issue of this publication, has requested Bureau authority to maintain contact with Jaffe pending coverage of one remaining lead involving review of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records in order to receive information concerning the Soviets with whom he is in contact and as a follow up of our 9-12-58 interview.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is believed that we should allow New York to continue contacts with Jaffe and and it is possible that this contact, if properly handled, may develop a source of information of significance concerning Soviet officials in New York as well as providing a possible source of information concerning the article and general policy of "The Nation" through such contacts as Jaffe may still have on the staff of that publication.

RECOMMENDATION:

If you approve, there is attached a letter to New York authorizing continued contacts with Jaffe concerning information of interest to us concerning Soviet officials and instructing New York to be alert in their contacts with Jaffe to develop any opportunity that might arise toward obtaining information concerning the general policy and personalities that Jaffe may have knowledge of who are presently

correspondents in the United States. Informent suggested that subject could remember what informant said during their conversations, and pass this information on to Soviet correspondents. Subject said that it was difficult for him to remember everything.

Informant advised subject that it is one thing to talk and another thing to write it down. He told subject that he is not an expert, and that subject's opinion is as good as his. Informant bluntly told subject that he did not like the idea proposed by subject, and that he can not write for him. Subject asked informant to consider writing this analysis of the American political situation, and said that he would be paid for this. Informant was quite shaken at this, and told subject that it was not a question of money, but that he just does not want to write for him.

Informant and subject also discussed Boris Pasternak, 1958 Nobel Prize Winner in Literature. Informant told subject that the Soviet treatment of Pasternak was an example of the lack of freedom in the Soviet Union. The subject replied by saying that the Soviets are trying to build a Socialist State, and can not tolerate criticism. Informant told subject that this was the reason that he was unable to understand or appreciate the Soviet political system, and that this was also the reason why he could never subscribe to a totalitarian form of government. Informant pointed out to subject that in the United States people were free to criticize as they saw fit, even if their criticism is directed toward the President of the United States. While people may take issue with this criticism, or even criticize the individual in return, the individual making the criticism had no reason to fear that he would be punished.

Subject's only reply to informant was that Pasternak's book, "Doctor Zhivago," was "political treason." Subject also said that this was "their system," with an air of finality.

On 10/30/57, SAM JAFFE and a CBS camera crew made a feature film in the NYO, which was telecast in two parts over certain CBS affiliate stations on 11, 13. and 14/57. JAFFE was in charge of making this film, and subsequently informed this office that CBS was highly pleased with the results obtained in this office.

Re Bulet, 8/28/58.14

JAFFE was interviewed on 9/12/58 by SAS JOHN G.
WILLIS and EDWARD F. GAMBER. JAFFE was extremely cooperative during interview. Interview was based on a telephone call which JAFFE made to this Office advising that he was taking VADIM A. BOGOSLOVSKI and BORIS N. IVANOV to dinner. Initially and throughout the interview JAFFE was told of the necessity for respecting the Bureau's confidence at all times. He agreed to do this.

The Bureau's jurisdiction in matters involving the internal security of the United States was explained to JAFFE as well as the Bureau's interest in Soviet Nationals which stems from this jurisdiction. Mention was made of the fact that a large number of Soviet Nationals have been declared personna non grata in recent years because of activities in which they have engaged while in this country in a diplomatic status. JAFFE said that he was aware of this.

JAFFE talked quite freely and at length about his association with Soviet Nationals. He said that in his capacity as a news reporter for the Columbia Broadcasting System, it was necessary for him to have as many contacts as possible in order to keep abreast of newsworthy incidents and information. He said that he has been very successful in cultivating the Soviets and other foreigners at the UN as news sources. He first met VADIM A. BOGOSLOVSKI and NIKOLAI KALININ at a press party at the Soviet Mission to the UN. He has gotten to know these Soviets very well, and in fact he has visited their homes and they have visited his home. He said that he sees these two Soviets very frequently and is particularly close to BOGOSLOVSKI, whom he describes as being very much unlike other Soviets. JAFFE said that BOGOSLOVSKI is very outspoken and in fact gave him a 24 hour "weat" on the decision of NIKITA KHRUSCHEV to accept an invitation to a Soviet conference under UN auspices. He said that the Soviets are usefulx in giving him the decision on what is going to happen. When the Mideast problem was before the UN, KALININ told JAFFE that it would resolve itself but that he should keep his eye on China.

In addition to BOGOSLOVSKI and KALININ, JAFFE is acquainted with the following Soviets:

JAFFE met KRESTYANOV on one occasion at a party at KALININ's home.

During interview JAFFE said that he would be willing to furnish information to the Bureau concerning his contacts with the Soviets. However, he said that he would have to be sure that his identity would be protected at all times. He said he did not want to become another BORIS MORROS or HERBERT PHILBRICK as it would ruin his career as a news reporter if he did so. He was told that the Bureau would respect his confidence, but that he in turn would have to respect the Bureau's confidence at all times.

JAFFE mentioned that at one time Afro-American News Reporter, mentioned that the State Department had asked him if he possessed any information 'indicating that JAFFE was a Communist. JAFFE mentioned this by way of inquiry of interviewing agents to ascertain if they knew of any such allegation. Interviewing agents then asked JAFFE if he had ever been a member of the CP, and he said that he had not been a member of the CP or any Communist inspired organization nor has he ever sympathized with the CP. He said that his uncle, with whom he has a close association, is the actor SAMUEL CHARLES JAFFE who was active on behalf of Russian War Relief and sympathized with what proved to be Communist inspired organizations. JAFFE said that he does not believe that his uncle was a member of the CP however, and that his uncle did testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.

on January 2, 22 and February 2, 1954 by Bureau Agents and was cooperative. He denied membership in the CP but admitted membership in 14 Communist front organizations. His file contains information reflecting alledged CP membership.

SAM JAFFE, subject of instant airtel, is acquainted with two known Soviet agents in the person of BARKOVSKY and KRESTYANOV, one potential Soviet defector in the person of BOGOSLOVSKI, and two other Soviets who are among the more active Soviets in the NYC area. All possible coverage of these Soviets is desirable.

Should JAFFE fail to respect the Bureau's confidence, he would jeopardize his own career and certainly his contacts at the UN. This is pointed out as it is believed that this puts the Bureau in a better position to control JAFFE than would be true in the case of the average individual.

It is not believed that JAFFE can be used in connection with the at this time because of his reluctance to do anything other than furnish information to the Bureau. However, it is believed that JAFFE can be used as an informant or source of information furnishing information with respect to his contacts with the Soviets.

This Office realizes that JAFFE's uncle presents one very serious drawback to his use as an informant.

NOTE: Jaffe is an employee of the Columbia Broadcasting System News Department, NYC. During the past several years he has had frequent contact with Soviet officials in the U.

On 7-23-58, he contacted NYO and indicated he was taking two Soviets attached to the UN Delegation to dinner. By letter 8-19-58, NYO requested Bureau authority to conduct "sounding out" interview with Jaffe to determine whether he might have potential for development as a selected contact whom we can place in touch with the Soviets for intelligence purposes. NYO indicated that appropriate precautions would be observed during this interview, inasmuch as Jaffe is employed by a news media.

DATE: 5/3/57

Re New York Airtel 4/1/57, captioned in which information is set forth reflecting that on 3/29/57 Street, Brooklyn, New York (protect identity) furnished information that he had ascertained through a discussion with associates of his, that SAM JAFFE (ph); INDONESIA a free lance reporter, had left a gathering of the Asian-African Student Group some months ago in the company of VLADIMIR A.

As the Bureau is aware, GRUSHA, a Soviet National, is a known intelligence agent. He had been in the United States since 1953, and departed the United States on 4/10/57. In addition to being the Soviet principal in a double agent operation involving , in which he had attempted to secure information relating to Russian emigre, GRUSHA was recently identified through information from an informant as having actively cultivated a Ceylon National for the purpose of stealing the Ceylon code from the Delegation of the Ceylon Government in New York City.

On 3/5/57, Special Agents of the FBI observed the activities of a certain individual in the offices of the Ceylon Delegation where the afore-mentioned code was known to be kept, and subsequently observed this individual with GRUSHA. Approximately one hour later, after this individual had again been observed with GRUSHA, he was observed returning a red covered book to the offices of the Ceylon Delegation.

A review of the New York Office Indices reflects numerous references to the name SAMUEL JAFFE; however, based on the information from it would appear that the subject is identical with the JAFFE named by . This identification is based upon the following facts obtained from the previous investigation of the subject.

According to , JAFFE, on numerous occasions during 1955 and 1956, had been in contact with individuals at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C. in regard to visa matters pertaining to his contemplated travel to the USSR.

In April, 1954, according to JAFFE was in contact with the Soviet United Nations Delegation in New York City. At this time, it was determined that he was employed as a culture researcher for "Life" Magazine in New York City, and had contacted the Soviet United Nations Delegation in connection with some work he was doing on a story for this magazine. Subsequently, it was determined from inquiry at the offices of "Life" Magazine, that JAFFE was born on 6/19/28.

Passport records of the Department of State, reviewed on 7/27/55, (as set forth in WFO letter of 8/25/55), reflect that JAFFE, in a supplemental statement dated 6/22/55 in connection with his passport, indicated that he wished to have his passport amended to allow him to travel in Communist China as a professional American journalist. It was indicated further, that he had excellent reason to believe that the Red Chinese Government would allow him to enter their country as a journalist in view of the fact that during the Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, he obtained an interview with Red Chinese Premier CHOU-EN-LAI.

On 4/30/57, Mr.
200 East End Avenue, New York City, advised SA JOHN
F. MABEY that the subject, who is presently an employee
of the Columbia Broadcasting System in New York City,
presently resides in an apartment at this address with
his wife and small child.

In view of the information which is set forth
in the subject's investigative file reflecting numerous
past contacts on his part with various Soviets attached
to both the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., and
the Soviet United Nations Delegation, New York City,
and the fact that the subject has a history of employment
in the capacity of a news correspondent, the New York
Office feels that no contact should be initiated at
this time with the subject concerning his association
with GRUSHA. In addition, it is to be noted that
following a contact by the subject with KONSTANTIN G.
FEDOSEEV, Counselor, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.,
on 7/9/54, a representative of "Time" and "Life"
Magazines contacted the Bureau, alleging that he believed
JAFFE had been under surveillance by the FBI.

The New York Office feels that subject's
contact of GRUSHA possibly can be logically explained
as a normal contact in view of the subject's employment,
and it is felt that an interview with JAFFE would
possibly result in embarrassment to the Bureau should
the subject take exception to the Bureau's interest
in his activities.

Copies of this letter are being disseminated
to the Washington Field Office and San Francisco Office
for information in view of their past interest in the
subject.

Jaffe was interviewed at his request by agents of this Bureau on January 3, 1956, at his home 301 Fletcher Drive, Atherton, California. He identified himself as a correspondent currently representing the North American Newspaper Alliance. He stated he was formerly employed by "Time" and "Life" and in connection with this latter employment, had been assigned to writing and research on the articles published in "Life" magazine dealing with the various religions of the world. Jaffe stated that in connection with this assignment he made the acquaintance of Fedoseev (Konstantin G. Fedoseev), Counselor, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C. Jaffe said he had contacted Fedoseev initially in his efforts to obtain a visa to enable him to enter China. He commented this had been a mistake to approach the Soviets in this regard inasmuch as they could not or at least did not, do anything to aid in the issuance of the visa.

Jaffe advised he had been attempting to obtain a visa to enter the Soviet Union to write a series of articles on conditions existing there and in his efforts to obtain this visa he had again contacted Fedoseev. After considerable delay, he was advised that a visa would be issued for a period not to exceed two weeks. Jaffe said he contacted Fedoseev in the hope that he could obtain a visa for a longer period of time, but Fedoseev advised Jaffe the issuance of such a visa would not follow, but that he could possibly obtain an extension on the two weeks' visa. Jaffe stated he challenged the statement of Fedoseev that his visa would be extended and since he could receive assurance of a visa for a period not to exceed two weeks, he had decided against making the trip to the Soviet Union and he returned to his home in Atherton from Washington, D. C., and New York.

Jaffe commented that in discussing his desire for a visa with Fedoseev, the latter had indicated that should Jaffe write objectively concerning the Soviet Union he, Fedoseev, felt certain Jaffe's visa would be extended. Jaffe said he challenged this remark by Fedoseev and indicated to the latter he felt Fedoseev's remarks were equivalent to blackmail and that in order for him to get an extension on his visa it would be necessary for him to slant his articles in favor of the Soviet Union. Fedoseev denied this intent and stated only that they desired the articles to be written objectively.

Inasmuch as the Passport Office, Department of State, Washington, D.

These files were reviewed on 7/27/55 by SA ALBERT B. MILLER and reflect the following:

By communication dated 6/6/55, the American Embassy at New Delhi, India, advised the Department of State, Washington, D. C., that in consequence of the recent KHRUSHCHEV (a high official in the Soviet government) statement welcoming visits from American journalists, SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE, Special Correspondent of "The Nation" and his wife, JOSEPHINE WINTER JAFFE, have inquired of the Soviet Embassy, New Delhi, regarding the possibility of a three-week visit to the Soviet Union and they say a tentative reply is affirmative.

Soviet visas are assured their passports should be endorsed that when appropriately visaed. each is valid for one round trip to the USSR for a period not to exceed three weeks.

An application dated 2/23/55 at San Francisco, California, for a passport by JAFFE reflects the following:

His full name is SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE and he was böm 6/19/29 at San Francisco, California. His peymanent residence is 301 Fletcher Drive, Atherton, California, and his mailing address is 68 Post Street, San Francisco, California. He has never resided outside the U. S. His last American passport was obtained from Washington, D. C., on 5/25/51, number 444214.

(It is noted that the application in regard to Passport Number 444214 was unavailable for review. Information regarding possible previous passports was also unavailable. All passport infomation which was available is set forth herein.)

His mother, DOROTHY I. JAFFE, born in Ohio, is deceased. His father, ABRAM SJAFFE, born in Russia about 1893, resides at 891_28th_ Avenue, San Francisco, California. ABRAM S. JAFFE immigrated to the U. S. about 1894, has resided continuously in the U. S. from 1894 to 1955, and was naturalized at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, date unknown, through his father.

He was last married on 12/27/52 to JOSEPHINE CLARK WINTER, who was born in New York City in 1932 and who resides at the above Flecher Drive address.

JAFFE applied for the passport to visit on "business - 'Nation' magazine, Djakarta, Indonesia, approximately three weeks." Under countries to be visited he listed India, Thailand, Burma, Japan, Indonesia, and Pakistan. He intended to depart San Francisco about 3/15/55 via Pan American Airways and intended to stay abroad three or four months.

The application described him as 5' 10", brown hair, brown eyes, occupation, journalist. A photograph of him affixed to the application shows his hair is cut short and that he wears a mustache.

He was issued Passport Number 36093, San Francisco series, on 2/25/55. This passport is not valid for travel to Albania, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, or the USSR unless specifically endorsed by the Department of State as being valid for such travel.

A letter dated 2/23/55 on the letterhead of the "Nation," 68 Post Street, San Francisco, California, signed by JAFFE as West Coast Correspondent addressed to the Passport Agency, Department of State, San Francisco, California, relates that his Far Eastern trip will be made as a working journalist; that the trip will last approximately three months and he will visit such countries as Japan, Burma, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Thailand.

A letter dated 2/25/55 on the above letterhead, signed by JAFFE, as West Coast Bureau Chief, addressed to Mr. HARRY H. BOLDS, Passport Agency, San Francisco, California, relates that as the "Nation" magazine's West Coast Bureau Chief he is classed as a member of the Publications Board of Editors. Thus, he is in the position of an editorial executive. He wrote further that as he explained to BOLDS those in authority at their home office in New York are on vacation. While in the employ of Time, Incorporated, "Life" magazine, he made a trip to Asia in an editorial capacity; that BOLDS' New York office asked him to write a letter on "Life"stationery stating the purpose of his trip abroad though at the time he was making the journey for some other publications. He explained this and the fact that he was only a reporter. This, JAFFE wrote, seemed to make no difference as long as the New York agency had a letter on file.

An application for amendment of Passport Number 36093, San Francisco series, as above, dated June 22, 1955, and signed by JAFFE, Imperial Hotel, New Delhi, India, was forwarded by the American Consular Service at New Delhi to the Department of State, Washington, D. C., for consideration and decision. The application reflects that JAFFE desired his passport be made valid for travel in Communist China. In the application he referred to an attached supplemental statement.

The supplemental statement is dated 6/22/55 and is on the letterhead of Hotel Imperial, New Delhi. It shows the following:

If this request is not within the power of the Department of State to approve, he desires to know if the Department of State would have any objection if he deposited his passport with the nearest Embassy and entered Communist China, assuming all risks, as a private citizen.

His purpose in visiting Communist China would be in the capacity of a professional journalist for the "Nation" magazine of America and other American publications to write on what is taking place in Red China today. He would also seek an interview with Red China's leader MAO TSE-TUNG and other Communist officials. He would try to interview the eleven American fliers held by the Reds and the Americans who have deflected to the side of the Reds. He would deport himself in the best interests of the U. S. and would provide information to his Government upon his return.

He has excellent reasons to believe that the Red Chinese government would allow him to enter their country as a journalist. During the Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, he obtained an interview with Red Chinese Premier CHOU-EN-LAI through the good offices of Prime Minister U NU of Burma. He filed a full report of this interview with the American Embassy at Rangoon, Burma on 5/20/55 and previously he had 'informed the American Consul at Singapore of certain statements CHOU-EN-LAI made to him during the interview. The Red Chinese know that Prime Minister U NU thinks well of him.

He was also told by one KANG MAO-CHAO, Counselor for Cultural Affairs at the Red Chinese Embassy in New Delhi that he stood an excellent chance of being admitted to his country, as "My Premier was impressed by the way your story was handled." KANG MAO-CHAO added that also in his favor was the fact that CHOU-EN-LAI knew him as well as do others in his government. His request for admittance to Red China is presently being considered by the authorities at Peking.

JAFFE concluded his statement by relating that he hopes that in making a decision the Department will realize that it would be in the best interests of our Government and our people that an American journalist be permitted to visit Red China to report firsthand on the state of affairs there.

An Application dated 7/31/52 at New York City for a passport by Mrs. JAFFE, then JOSEPHINE CLARK WINTER, reflects the following:

WFO 105-8906

Her full name is JOSEPHINE CLARK WINTER and she was born 10/10/23 at New York City. Her permanent residence and mailing address is 215 East 73rd Street, New York City.. She resided outside the U. S. in France and Italy from 6/20/51 to 7/51. Her last American passport, number 448639, was obtained from Washington, D. C., in June, 1951, and is lost. She has never married.

Her father, LESTER CLARK WINTER, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, about 1907 and resides at Mission Road, Mission, Kansas. Her mother, JOSEPHINE A. CAVE, was born at Cleveland, Ohio, on or about 11/22/10 and resides at 19 East 72nd Street, New York City.

She applied for the passport to visit France, Italy, Switzerland, and England for pleasure. She planned to depart New York via TWA about 8/6/52 and intended to stay abroad one month.

PAUL (last two names illegible), no relation, 4324 Colden Street, Flushing 52, New York, completed an affidavit that he has known JOSEPHINE CLARK WINTER for four years and that the statements made by her in the application are true to the best of his knowledge and belief.

The application described her as 5' 7", brown hair, brown eyes, occupation "none."

She completed an affidavit on 7/31/52 that she lost the American passport which was issued her about June, 1951; that she made an exhaustive search for it and it is not in her possession. She does not know where or when she lost it; did not give it to anybody, or let anybody take it. She reported the loss to the 19th Precinct, Police Department of New York City, East 67th Street.

By letter dated 7/31/52, return address New York City, to the Department of State, Washington, D. C., she asked that her passport be issued in time for her flight on TWA, 8/6/52, because the trip is necessary immediately as her grandmother, sojourning in Paris, urgently desires her presence on the 7th.

She was issued Passport Number 50858, New York series, on 8/1/52 at New York City. This passport was not valid for travel to

Albania, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, or the USSR unless specifically endorsed by the Department of State as being valid for such travel. It was also valid for only two months, to expire 10/1/52.

She applied to have her passport, number 50858, New York series, amended to show her date of birth as 10/23/32 instead of 10/10/23 as shown in her passport. Her passport was so amended on 8/6/52. A notation by the amending official on this undated application, reflects that a previous passport, number 631887, issued on 6/9/39 at Washington, D. C., shows her date of birth as 10/23/32.

A Photostat of a City of New York Certificate of Birth reflects that a female WINTER was born in New York to LESTER C. and JOSEPHINE on 10/23/32.

She applied to have the above passport amended to show her married name, JOSEPHINE WINTER JAFFE. She set forth that she married SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE on 12/27/52 at New York City. A handwritten notation dated 5/3/54 by a passport office employee on the undated application, reflects that the passport should be amended to show her married name JOSEPHINE WINTER JAFFE.

An undated memo signed by her relates that she intends to accompany her husband for approximately six weeks, leaving the first part of August, to Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. "My husband, as a journalist is going to seek information for stories, on personal business."

On an undated application for a renewal of her passport number 50858, New York series, she related that since passport number 50858 was issued her on 8/1/52, she resided in Italy in August, 1952, on a vacation trip. She gave her mailing address as 25 Indian Road, New York 34, New York. She stated she intended to depart San Francisco, California, about 8/2/54 via PAA, proposed to stay abroad approximately six weeks, and intended to visit Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines on a vacation.

Her passport was renewed on 5/3/54, making it valid until 7/31/56. This passport is not valid for travel to or in Korea.

On the application, dated 5/25/51, at New York City, for passport number 448639, which was issued her on 6/1/51 at Washington, D. C., she gave her birth data as 10/23/32, New York City and her permanen

as student and related she intended to depart New York City about 6/1/51
for France, Germany, Italy, and Switzerland, for pleasure and intended to
stay abroad 55 days. According to the application, she was previously issued
passport number 631887 at Washington, D. C.; on 6/9/39 and resided outside
the U. S. in England from June, 1939, to 7/3/40. LOUIS PAVELEK, friend,
1448 121st Street, South Ozone Park, New York, completed an affidavit
that he has known her ten years and to the best of his knowledge and
belief the statements made by her in the above application are true.

In connection with passport number 631887, as above, it is
noted that she was six years old when it was issued. WFO did not ask
the Passport Office to make the application for it available.

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE was searched through WFO indices with the
following results:

A report of SA MARTIN CAREY dated 11/2/51 at New York entitled
New York origin, Bufile 62-77787-
240, New York file 100-92701, WFO file 105-1105-30, lists chronologically
the daily activities of the Soviet delegation, Byelorussian delegation,
Ukrainian delegation, and also those Soviet nationalists attached to the
U. N. Secretariat, all of which are in New York City. Pages 1, 8, 9, and
11 of the above report reflect that T-l, who has furnished reliable
information in the past (Security Informant ), learned that on
8/29/51 a Mr. SAM A. JAFFE, stated he was contacting the delegation on
behalf of the San Francisco Press Club, indicated that the club wanted
to invite GROMYKO to speak informally before them. On the same date,
8/29/51, SAM JAFFE recontacted the delegation and since he was unable
to contact GROMYKO in New York, indicated that he would have a friend
contact GROMYKO in San Francisco. The above New York report then sets
out parenthetically that it should be noted that this JAFFE is not
identical with a person of the same name connected with the New York
State Communist Party.

WFO indices reflect the following information from
(FEDOSEEV and SMIRNOVSKY, referred to below, are characterized
as follows):

(The 'Diplomatic List" of August, 1954, issued by the Department of State, reflects KONSTANTIN G FEDOSEEV as a counselor, Embassy of the USSR, and MIKHAIL N. SMIRNOVSKY as a First Secretary, Embassy of the USSR.

On 7/13/53, one SAM JAFFY (phonetic), asked E. P. PODGORNAYA for N. P. SAVCHENKO or anyone else with whom he could talk about a visa. PODGORNAYA advised JAFFY that no one was in the office as it was lunch time, JAFFY related he would call again after the lunch hour.

The "Diplomatic List," July, 1953, issued by the Department of State, lists NIKOLAI P SAVCHENKO as a Second Secretary, Embassy of the USSR, and ELENA P PODGORNAYA as an Attache, Embassy of the USSR,

On 12/30/53, FEDOSEEV contacted SAM JAFFE in New York regarding the letter he had sent to Ambassador ZARUBIN on November 24th. FEDOSEEV said per JAFFE's request ZARUBIN had sent this letter on to Moscow but to date no reply had been received, and further in line with JAFFE's letter of December 28th, FEDOSEEV would advise him when anything is received. JAFFE went on to indicate that he is coming to Washington tomorrow and that he is going to visit at the Legation of Yemen since the King of Yemen has granted him permission to visit Yemen to do the Islamic phase of the religious story. JAFFE mentioned that he is doing a series of articles and stories on the various religions. FEDOSEEV will contact JAFFE when anything is received from Moscow.

On 1/20/54 SAM JAFFE, "Life" magazine, asked SMIRNOVSKY whether the Embassy had heard anything from Moscow about the thing he had spoken to him and Ambassador ZARUBIN about. SMIRNOVSKY said they had not. JAFFE pointed out that they wanted to do a completely fair job on all five religions, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, and they could not do justice to the last three without actually going to China. SMIRNOVSKY was very friendly and said he would try to see that the people in Moscow were reminded again.

On 2/5/54, SAM JAFFEY (phonetic); asked SMIRNOVSKY if he received the letters and was told he had. JAFFEY asked if any action would be taken. SMIRNOVSKY replied that the Ambassador was not here to act upon it and as a result the matter will be decided upon in Moscow. JAFFE said he heard reports and has read in the newspapers that there are Chinese advisors in Berlin at the present time. SMIRNOVSKY replied

/ that he had read this also. JAFFE expressed considerable concern about receiving action on his proposal. and then asked if SMIRNOVSKY knew of any place in the U. S. where one could buy Russian vodka and SMIRNOVSKY said he did not.

On 2/18/54 SAM JAFFEY (phonetic), told SMIRNOVSKY that he planned to be in Washington next Thursday and wondered if SMIRNOVSKY would have lunch with him. SMIRNOVSKY said he would and suggested that he call him when he gets in town. JAFFEY said he is working on a story regarding the Indian caste system; that he already has the Hindu story laid out covering about 40 pages; that at a conference yesterday it was decided that photos would have to be taken in China, ie, pictures of temples but still they have not received an answer from the Peking government. JAFFEY wondered if Ambassador ZARUBIN could be of further help in this matter if a wire were sent to him in Germany. SMIRNOVSKY said it would be all right to send the wire. They agreed to discuss this further Thursday.

On 2/26/54 SAM JAFFE, "Life," tried to reach Ambassador ZARUBIN finally spoke instead with FEDOSEEV, with whom he went over again "Life's" project for photographic essays of religions of the world and their desire to get into China. FEDOSEEV promised that he and the Ambassador would do all they could, but that they just had not heard as yet. JAFFE emphasized that all he wants is a definite answer even if it is no.

On 3/22/54, SAM JAFFE asked whether FEDOSEEV had heard any word from the Peoples Republic of China regarding his request. JAFFE pointed out that the Chinese will be holding a big Confucius ceremony in April and he would like to cover it to get material for his story. JAFFE went into great detail explaining the importance for covering the ceremony in China proper since it is the birth place of Confucius. He said they would probably cover it in Korea and on Formosa. FEDOSEEV agreed to talk the request overagain with the Ambassador and call JAFFE when something comes in.

On 4/9/54, SAM JAFFE tried to reach FEDOSEEV, was told that he was out to lunch now and to call back at 2 o'clock. JAFFE said that he wanted to know something about the "Red Star" magazine (Red Army magazine), and was told FEDOSEEV would help on this matter.

On 4/9/54 SAM JAFFE again attempted to reach FEDOSEEV and was told by SMIRNOVSKY that he was not in the Embassy. JAFFE said this call did not pertain to the Chinese proposal but to a drawing published in the end of the March issue of the "Red Star" of the "H Bomb."

SMIRNOVSKY said he had not received that issue as yet but to contact Mr.
TARASOV in the New York office and see if he has that issue. JAFFE said
he had contacted TARASOV regarding this matter and that TARASOV was
checking on it. JAFFE said he would then recontact TARASOV.

On 6/28/54 SAM JAFFE (phonetic), told FEDOSEEV that he was
calling to say hello. He was in Washington up at the "Life" office for
two weeks and he wondered if FEDOSEEV would like to have dinner with him
and his wife one day during his stay here. FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE for his
telephone number - Republic 7-6050 and said he would call JAFFE in a
couple of days. FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE when it would be convenient for
him. JAFFE said he would be free any time.

On 7/2/54 SAM JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV if it would be all right
if they postponed their dinner because he was just notified that
EISENHOWER was making a trip this week and that he, JAFFE, was selected
to make the trip too. He will probably be back on Monday. FEDOSEEV
said he would be working on Monday and will call JAFFE about noon. JAFFE
is living at the Mayflower Hotel, Room 877. He will be glad to have
dinner with FEDOSEEV Monday night if the latter can arrange it.

On 7/5/54 FEDOSEEV tried to reach Room 877 at the Mayflower but
no one answered at the room.

On 7/6/54 SAM JAFFE informed FEDOSEEV that he had expected
to call him yesterday but that the President had decided to stay
another day. JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV when they could meet and gave him a
choice of Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. JAFFE suggested that they
meet (did not say where) at 7 o'clock and FEDOSEEV said he would call
him back at his office either today or tomorrow to make it definite.
FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE when he would be leaving Washington and JAFFE said
he thought it would be on Saturday.

On 7/12/54 SAM JAFFE told FEDOSEEV that he had just talked to
Mr. HUNT about getting a picture of the ZARUBINs either today or tomorrow
in the big room of the Embassy. FEDOSEEV promised to check with the
Ambassador and call JAFFE back either today or tomorrow.

On 8/19/55 SAM JAFFE, Nation magazine, calling from New York,
told K. G. FEDOSEEV that he applied for a visa to enter Russia on June
6th, in New Delhi, India, where he was during an Asian tour for the
magazine. He checked on the visa in Rome and in Paris, but got no word.
He checked in London, where they had no information, but Mr. MOLCHANOV
there promised to check with Moscow on it. Also, while in London, JAFFE
said he contacted KINGSLEY/MARTIN, of the "New Statesman," who had just

returned from Russia. MARTIN said he had a friend in the Soviet Embassy
in London, a First Secretary, Mr. DENCHINSKY (ph), who also talked to JAFFE
about the visa and promised to help. Just before JAFFE left London for
the U. S., he received word from DENCHINSKY that the matter was being
considered at the highest level, and word of the results would be given to
the Soviet Embassy in Washington, or directly to the magazine in New York.
JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV to help him. FEDOSEEV asked if JAFFE planned on
being in Washington, D. C., scon. JAFFE said he hoped to be here next week.
It was arranged that he will call FEDOSEEV the day before coming down to
arrange to get together and FEDOSEEV will try to find out about the visa
in the meantime. JAFFE and FEDOSEEV recalled that they had had dinner
together some time ago.

WFO indices also reflect the following:

WFO agents on physical surveillance observed the following:

On 7/9/54 at 8:37 pm FEDOSEEV and his wife, NONNA N. FEDOSEEVA,
in the company of JAFFE and his wife departed the FEDOSEEV residence,
Chastleton Hotel, 1701 16th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C., and walked
to the Colony Restaurant, 1737 DeSales Street, N. W., which they entered
at 8:58 pm. They departed the restaurant at 11:18 pm and walked to the
vicinity of the FEDOSEEV residence where the couples separated. JAFFE
and his wife then entered a taxicab and thereafter engaged in strenuous
efforts to detect or lose the physical surveillance.

The Bureau advised NY and WFO by letter dated 7/19/54 that on
the following day, 7/10/54, a representative of "Time" and "Life"
magazines contacted the Bureau alleging that he believed JAFFE had been
under surveillance by the FBI on the previous night. A representative
of "Time" and "Life" magazines stated that JAFFE has an assignment to
write a story on contemporary religions and plans to go to Red China for
the purpose of studying Buddhism. JAFFE was in contact with FEDOSEEV
and other Soviets to obtain their co-operation in travel clearance.

With the above letter, the Bureau sent to WFO for its
information a copy of a letter dated 6/11/54 from New York to the Bureau
captioned "SAM A. JAFTE, IS - R, and __________. " For the
information of San Francisco, this letter reads as follows:

On 4/9/54 _________ advised that SAM JAFFE, JUdson 6-1212,
Ext. 120, spoke to TARASOV and called him by his first name, IVAN. JAFFE
stated it has been a long time since he spoke to TARASOV. According to
the infomant, JAFFE told TARASOV, "We are still working on that China
thing and we are dealing with KONSTANTIN FEDOSEEV in Washington."
JAFFE mentioned to TARASOV he wanted to get hold of "Red Star" magazine,
March issue, which contains a story JAFFE wanted to see. TARASOV said
he would look it up and call JAFFE:

In addition to the information set forth above, the Bureau's letter of 7/19/54 set forth that inasmuch as the reason for JAFFE'S contacts with the Soviets has been determined and in view of his allegations in regard to a physical surveillance conducted on him on 7/9/54, it is not believed desirable to continue inquiries in regard to him for the purpose of considering his development as a source of information in regard to Soviet activities. The Bureau concluded that no further investigation should be conducted regarding JAFFE unless additional information comes to WFO or NY's attention that JAFFE may be engaged in activities inimical to the security of the U. S., at which time the Bureau should be appropriately advised.

Your observation that the Soviets very possibly are advising persons contacting them to be alert for surveillances may very well be true. It is desired, therefore, that at your next Surveillance Squad Conference that the surveillance of Fedoseev on 7/9/54 be thoroughly discussed so that all Special Agents employed on surveillances can again be alerted to the possible attempts by the Soviets to endeavor to cause embarrassment to the Bureau through any means.

As we have now determined the reason for Jaffe's contacts with the Soviets and in view of his allegations in regard to a physical surveillance conducted on him on July 9, 1954, it is not believed desirable to continue inquiries in regard to him for the purpose of considering his development as a source of information in regard to Soviet activities, Therefore no further investigation should be conducted in' this matter unless additional information comes to your attention indicating that Jaffe may be engaged in activities inimical to the security of the United States, at which time, the Bureau should be appropriately advised.

In Mr. Nichols' memo to Mr. Tolson dated July 13, 1954, it is reported that James R. Shepley of "Time" and "Life" magazines in Washington, called on July 10, 1954, stating that he believed the FBI had a surveillance on Sam Jaffe, a writer for "Time" and "Life" who has the assignment of writing a story on contemporary religions. Shepley stated that Jaffe plans to visit Red China to study Buddhism.

Jaffe and his wife on July 9, 1954, had dinner with Konstantin Fedoseev of the Soviet Embassy and the latter's wife. Shepley stated the purpose of this meeting was to get Fedoseev's cooperation in travel clearance. The Director commented, "I want facts re this situation."

FTO has submitted a memorandum of explanation from the Agents engaged in the surveillance referred to above. This memo states that at 8:37 p.m. on the night of July 9, 1954, surveilling agents observed Fedoseevs, accompanied by an unidentified couple leave the Fedoseev's residence and walk to a nearby restaurant. During this period the four persons under surveillance did not appear to be surveillance conscious. Agents did not enter the restaurant as they thought this would be indiscreet. The Fedoseevs and the unidentified couple left the restaurant at 11:18 p.m. and were immediately observed to scrutinize passing traffic and other pedestrians in the area. In view thereof, the surveillance was maintained from a discreet distance. After walking in a roundabout way to the residence of the Fedoseevs at 10th and E Sts., N.W., the unidentified couple took a taxi. The taxi followed a circuitous route to the Mayflower Hotel, during which time the unidentified couple constantly peered through the rear and side windows at passing automobiles and pedestrians. After leaving the taxi at the Mayflower Hotel at 12:26 a.m., the unidentified couple subsequently identified as Sam Jaffe and his wife, of "Time" and "Life" magazines, engaged in a series of maneuvers designed to determine if they were under surveillance. This included several entrances to the Mayflower Hotel and excursions to side streets in vicinity during which period they appeared to be looking for surveillance by hiding in store fronts and doorways and unexplainably reversing the direction of their travel. Six different agents participated.

at one time or another in the surveillance on foot and three different automobiles were used at various times. Surveillance agents and automobiles were interchanged frequently and according to the agents, no situation arose indicating that their surveillance had been in fact detected. SAC Loughlin of the WTO talked to the agents who conducted it and a tates that during the period after the surveillance was initiated at 6:37 p.m. when the four individuals went from the Chastelton Hotel to the Colony Restaurant none of them indicated any awareness of surveillance or any consciousness of being surveilled; however, when the porty left the restaurant at 11:18 p.m. they were noted to be on the lookout for surveillance and the agents proceeded with appropriate discretion. SAC Laughlin states that it would appear that something may have been said while the party was in the restaurant about being followed by the FBI which could account for the sudden awareness of the possible surveillance. It has been the experience of VFO fron persons interviewed that they have been told by the Russiana they pruhably would be surveilled as a result of being in contact with the Russiana. [^c]

G10 Laughlin further points out the tazi driver who was interviewed some twenty minutes after he left the Jaffes at the Hayflower Hotel staton that after picking up the couple at 16th and R Etses N. W., they told him they were "newspaper people," had spent the evening with a "couple of Russians" and they probably would be followed. The cob driver was instructed to try to "lose them." The cab driver s tated that the Jaffes were attempting to obtain license numbers but he did not think they were successful. He stated that he, himself, had not been able to detect any surveillance. SAC Laughlin further points out thas on one occasion when Jaffe and his wife entered the Mayflower Hotel they looked back out of the entrance on to the street and were not aware of the fact that the surveilling agents had preceded them into the hotel lobby by a side entrance and were in the lobby at the time the Jaffes were looking outside for the surveillance. WFO subsequently identified the Jaffes through inquiries at the hotel and by reference to material in "TO files which was located the following day.

In this connection, it is to be noted that Jaffe was already the subject of an investigation by reason of his previous contacts with the Soviets with a view to possible future interview with him for consideration as a source of information in regard to the Soviets. [^c]

SAC Laughlin states that in view of the difficult circumstances under which this surveillance was conducted, it does not appear that

[^c]:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 154

it was handled indiscreetly and therefore, does not recommend any administrative action. (U)

OBSERVATIONS:

Fedoseev is a Counselor at the Soviet Embassy and his wife is in charge of the Press Department which has replaced the defunct Soviet Information Bulletin. Both are important figures at the Soviet Embassy and are suspected of Soviet intelligence activities. The importance of identifying unknown individuals who have personal contact with officials of Soviet establishments and in particular with persons like Fedoseev and his wife is an important and necessary part of our coverage of Soviet activities. It becomes even more important to identify such persons when they act in a suspicious manner or attempt to detect a possible surveillance. (C)

RECOMMENDATION:

1. As it appears that the surveillance was conducted discreetly under difficult circumstances and no specific fact has been developed indicating that the surveillance was in fact compromised, the statement of the "Time" and "Life" magazines representative would appear to reflect only Jaffe's suspicions that he was under surveillance. No administrative action is recommended. (U)

2. In view of the actions of Jaffe in the matter and as we now know the reason for his contacts with the Soviets, no further consideration should be given to an interview with him for possible development as a source of information regarding Soviet activities. A letter to the New York and Washington Field offices containing appropriate instructions is attached hereto. (U)

# Office Memorandum • UNITED OVERNMENT

TO : Director, FBI

FROM : SAC, WFO

DATE: July 15, 1954

SUBJECT:

Re telephone call from Mr. C. E. HENNRICH of the Bureau today regarding this matter.

Attached is a memorandum submitted by Special Agents ARTHUR J. ACHENBACH, KEVIN F. FLANAGAN, DONALD A. GRUENTZEL, JOHN H. KENOYER, ROBERT G. MCGEARY and JOSEPH E. SCULLY describing the surveillance maintained by them on FEDOSEEVA, her husband, SAM JAFFEE and his wife on the evening of July 9, 1954.

I have talked to the Agents who handled this surveillance which was being conducted in accordance with instructions issued under the Soviet Intensification Program. The purpose of these surveillances is to determine whether the subjects under surveillance are engaged in intelligence or espionage activities and to identify any contacts which may be observed in the course of the surveillance.

As explained by the Agents, and as will be noted from the attachment, the surveillance was initiated at 8:37 P.M., at which time this party were observed walking from the Chastleton Hotel to the Colony Restaurant. During this period, which constituted approximately twenty minutes, no activities whatever on the part of the subjects under surveillance indicated any awareness or any consciousness of being surveilled. As the party left the restaurant at 11:18 P.M., they were noted to be on the lookout for a surveillance, even going to the extent of scrutinizing passing persons and traffic. The Agents noticed this awareness immediately and proceeded with appropriate discretion. It would appear that something may have been said during the time the party were in the restaurant about being followed by the FBI, which may account for the sudden awareness of a surveillance on the part of this group. It has been the experience of this office from persons we have interviewed that

they have been told by the Russians they probably would be surveilled as a result of their contact with the Russians.

The remarks made to the taxi driver, as reported by him, plus the activities of this group, reflect a definite effort on their part to determine whether they were actually under surveillance. The admission by the taxi driver that he did not detect any surveillance seemed to indicate that it was handled properly and with discretion. This would appear to be borne out further by the fact that when Mr. JAFFEE and his wife entered the Mayflower Hotel they looked out of the Mayflower Hotel onto the street and were obviously not aware of the fact that Bureau Agents had them under surveillance in the lobby of the hotel.

The surveillance of Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE was discontinued at 12:42 A.M., when it was learned from the cab driver that they possibly were "newspaper people", but thereafter inquiries were made in the hotel to determine the identity of the JAFFEES.

In view of the difficult circumstances under which this surveillance was conducted, it does not appear that it was handled indiscreetly and, therefore, no administrative action is recommended.

FROM : SAS ARTHUR J. ACHENBACH, KEVIN F. FLANAGAN, DONALD A GRUENTZEL, JOHN H. KENOYER, ROBERT G. MCGEARY, JOSEPH E. SCULLY

SUBJECT: IS - R
(Physical Surveillance of July 9, 1954)

The following summarizes the physical surveillance conducted on July 9, 1954, concerning KONSTANTIN G. FEDOSEEV, ASAM JAFFEE, and Mrs. JAFFEE.
MRS. FEDOSEEV

At 8:37 P.M., SAS DONALD A. GRUENTZEL and ROBERT G. MOGEARY observed Mr. and Mrs. FEDOSEEV and an unknown young couple, subsequently identified as SAM JAFFEE and wife, leave the Chastleton Hotel, lóth and R Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. They walked directly to the Colony Restaurant, 1737 DeSales Place, N. W., by way of 16th Street, N Street and 17th Street, N. W. They were observed to enter this restaurant at 8:58 P.M. No attempt was made to keep the party under observation within the restaurant, because it was felt that this could not be done discreetly.

At 11:18 P.M., SAS JOSEPH E. SCULLY, DONALD A. GRUENTZEL and ROBERT G. MCGEARY observed the party leaving the Colony Restaurant. These Agents, who were on foot, observed the group walk west on DeSales Place, N. W., north on Connecticut Avenue to N Street, N. W. They observed that FEDOSEEV and JAFFEE walked together very slowly and appeared to be in deep conversation. It was also noted that FEDOSEEVA and Mrs. JAFFEE were walking together about 10 feet behind their husbands and were also conversing. The Agents noticed that the party on departing the Colony Restaurant appeared to be scrutinizing passing traffic and other pedestrians in the area. Consequently, the Agents maintained a discreet distance from the group.

On reaching Connecticut Avenue, SA JOHN H. KENOYER took over the surveillance on foot and observed the party continuing to walk north on Connecticut Avenue, around Dupont Circle, N. W., at which time SA DONALD A. GRUENTZEL rejoined the surveillance on foot. The two Agents observed the party walk northeast on New Hampshire Avenue, N. W., to 16th Street, N. W., and then south on the west side of 16th Street, N. W., to R Street, N. W. While walking from Dupont Circle to this point, the Agents noticed that the party carefully observed other pedestrians and passing automobiles. At no time did a Bureau automobile pass the party or come within its sight. The cars were utilized solely

for maintaining contact with the Agents who were on foot.

Agents GRUENTZEL and KENOYER observed the party standing on the corner of 16th and R Streets, N. W., conversing for about three minutes. At 12:04 A.M., Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed entering Skyking Taxi Cab #60. At this time, the Agents on foot brought up a surveillance car occupied by SAS SCULLY and ACHENBACH. These Agents observed the taxi proceeding south on 16th Street to M Street, N. W. At this point, SA MCGEARY, in another Bureau car, took over the surveillance and observed the cab proceeding west on M Street to 17th Street, N. W., then south on 17th Street, N. W., to I Street, N. W., at which point SA KEVIN F. FLANAGAN, in another Bureau car, took over the surveillance. SA FLANAGAN observed the taxi proceeding west on I Street and south on 17th Street to E Street, N. W. At this point, the first surveillance car took over the surveillance and observed the taxi proceeding east on E Street, N. W., then circle through the Ellipse back to 17th Street, N. W. At this point, SA MCGEARY, in a Bureau car, rejoined the surveillance, and the Agents in both cars observed the taxi cab proceeding north on 17th Street, N. W., and Connecticut Avenue to the Mayflower Hotel. The Agents noticed that from the time Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE entered the taxi cab until they alighted at the Mayflower Hotel, they frequently looked through the rear window of the taxi cab. The cab varied its speed noticeably throughout the ride.

![scribbled note](scribble)

At 12:26 A.M., Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed by SAs ACHENBACH, FLANAGAN and KENOYER leaving the taxi in front of the hotel. They looked up and down the street and then walked south on Connecticut Avenue, almost to L Street, N. W., whereupon they turned around and started back toward the hotel. At this time, SAS ACHENBACH and KENOYER entered the hotel through the DeSales Street entrance and seated themselves in the lobby. Agent FLANAGAN entered the hotel through the Connecticut Street entrance and proceeded to the desk. About three minutes later, Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed by these Agents entering the hotel through the Connecticut Avenue entrance. Immediately after entering the hotel, Mr. JAFFEE and his wife were observed standing in the entrance-way and looking up and down Connecticut Avenue. They then proceeded to the center of the lobby where they separated. Agents KENOYER and ACHENBACH observed Mr. JAFFEE walk toward the 17th Street end of the lobby and out of sight. All three Agents observed Mrs. JAFFEE walk to the hotel desk, at which SA FLANAGAN was filling out a reservation form under an alias. After completing the form, SA FLANAGAN walked out of the hotel. At this time, SAS ACHENBACH and KENOYER observed Mrs. JAFFEE purchase a package of cigaretts at the desk. She was then rejoined by her husband, and both Agents observed the couple leave the hotel. During the time that Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were in the

![scribbled note](scribble)

-NW-88326-Docld:32989704-Page-158


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 159

lobby, the Agents noticed that the JAFFEES were very observant of persons in the lobby. In view of the late hour, few people were in the lobby.

At 12:32 A.M., SA GRUENTZEL observed Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE come out of the Connecticut Avenue exit of the hotel and, after looking up and down Connecticut Avenue, walk south on Connecticut Avenue to L Street, N. W. At this time, SA ACHENBACH joined the foot surveillance of Agent GRUENTZEL. They observed the JAFFEES crossing Connecticut Avenue at L Street and disappear from view going west on L Street. Approximately two minutes later, SA ACHENBACH observed Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE in a doorway located on the L Street side of a business establishment at the intersection of L Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W. He observed that they were looking intently through the plate glass windows of the store in the direction of the Mayflower Hotel. At this point, Agent ACHENBACH, who was standing on a streetcar platform at the corner of L Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W., boarded a south-bound streetcar. Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were next observed by SAS SEULLY and GRUENTZEL running across L Street to the south side and walking west on L Street to 18th Street. After reaching 18th Street, they re-crossed to the north side of L Street and returned to the Mayflower Hotel via L Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W. They entered the Mayflower Hotel at 12:42 A.M. Surveillance was discontinued at this time upon receipt of information from SA MCGEARY to the effect that Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were possibly "newspaper people."

After Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE alighted from the taxi cab in front of the Mayflower Hotel, SA MCGEARY located and interviewed the cab driver, ROBERT S. DAVIS, at 17th and M Streets, N. W. DAVIS informed SA McGEARY that immediately after picking up the couple at 16th & R Streets, N. W., they informed him that they were "newspaper people" and that they had spent the evening with a "couple of Russians" and that they probably would be followed. The cab driver stated further that he asked the couple if he should try to "lose them." Mrs. JAFFEE replied, "Yes, if you can." DAVIS also advised SA MCGEARY that Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were attempting to obtain license numbers, but that he did not think they were successful. He stated that he himself had not been able to detect any surveillance.

After Mrs. JAFFEE had purchased the cigaretts in the hotel and had departed with her husband, SA KENOYER asked the night manager at the hotel desk whether he was acquainted with the couple and whether they were registered at the hotel. The night manager replied that he did not know.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 160

Approximately 20 minutes after the couple had entered the hotel for the second time, SA FLANAGAN, under suitable pretext, interviewed the elevator operator, who advised that a couple answering the description of Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE had gotten off the elevator at the eighth floor.

Upon receipt of the information from SA MCGEARY, as obtained from the cab driver, that the couple were possibly associated with the Press, SA KENOYER contacted the appropriate supervisor and was instructed to discontinue the surveillance in view of the possibility that the unknown couple were associated with the Press.

It was noted in the early stages of the surveillance that the individuals involved were extremely surveillance conscious and the Agents made every attempt to be very discreet. As set forth in detail above, the automobiles and Agents involved were rotated as much as possible to avoid detection by the persons under surveillance. Even though it was apparent to the Agents that the parties under surveillance were apparently looking for a tail, it was not felt desirable to discontinue the surveillance until the couple were identified. The importance of identifying unknown individuals who have personal contact with officials of the Soviet establishments has been impressed on the Field by the Bureau as a necessary part of the Soviet Intensification Program.

On July 10, 1954, SA KENOYER ascertained that the files of this office reflect that SAM JAFFEE of Life magazine on July 6, 1954, discussed with KONSTANTIN G. FEDOSEEV the prospect of having dinner together. No definite plans were made for this dinner. The files also reflected that JAFFEE was residing in Room 877 of the Mayflower Hotel, which is the same floor to which the unknown couple proceeded on the night of July 9, 1954.. This information was not available to the Agents conducting the surveillance on July 9, 1954.

TIME-LIFE MAGAZINE

For record purposes, at 12:05 p.m., 7-10-54, James Shepley of the TIME and LIFE organization in Washington called Wick in my office. He said he could save us some work by reporting the following to us.

A TIME and LIFE writer from New York named Sam Jaafe has been assigned the writing of a story on contemporary religions. Jaafe and a photographer are going into Red China for the purpose of studying Buddhism.

Shepley said that on 7-9-54 Jaafe and his wife checked into Room 876 of the Mayflower Hotel (a suite maintained by TIME and LIFE) and that evening met with Konstantine Fedoseev of the Soviet Embassy at the Colonial Restaurant near the Mayflower where they had dinner. The purpose of this meeting was to obtain Fedoseev's cooperation in travel clearance. Jaafe has had several prior conversations with him.

Shepley said he believed the FBI had a surveillance on Jaafe the evening of 7-9-54 and he just wanted us to know, in case any inquiries arose, the purpose of Jaafe's contact with Fedoseev.

Wick thanked Shepley for bringing this to our attention and said it would be made a matter of record.

ACTION TAKEN:

Supervisor Tom Jenkins of the Washington Field Office was advised of the above at 12:15 p.m., 7-10-54. Jenkins advised that the Washington Field Office was aware of this situation the evening of 7-9-54, had identified Jaáfe as a TIME and LIFE employee and was fully cognizant of all the information passed on to the Bureau by Shepley.

Memorandum

TO: Mr. Jenkins

DATE: 9-13-74

FROM: J. J. McDermottar

SUBJECT: ASSASSINATION OF JOHN FITZGERALD
KENNEDY
DALLAS, TEXAS
11-22-63

Reference my memorandum of 9-12-74 concerning contacts between Inspector Bowers and Don Donahue, Special Assistant to Senator Henry Jackson (D-Wash.), regarding the information and photographs Donahue had obtained from Michael Canfield which Canfield believes are pertinent to captioned matter.

Late on 9-12-74 Donahue advised Bowers he had learned from Sam A. Jaffe, free-lance writer in Washington who has been involved with Canfield concerning this matter, that Canfield apparently has made a deal with Stern Magazine, a German publication described as the Life Magazine of Germany, for its use of the photographs Canfield has collected and the information concerning them. This magazine allegedly has arranged for a Swiss photographic expert to examine the pictures in an effort to determine if the three "bums" shown in the photographs might be identical to E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, and Thomas Arthur Vallee.

Supervisor John Ruhl of Washington Field Office advised Bowers on the night of 9-12-74 that he had received a call from Jaffe who was seeking an FBI evaluation of Canfield's reliability and the information Canfield had regarding the Kennedy assassination. Jaffe told Ruhl he had given Canfield $300 as an advance toward a possible story which he might write regarding the photographs and information Canfield has developed. Ruhl furnished Jaffe no information. He is submitting a communication to the Bureau on 9-13-74 furnishing full details of his conversation with Jaffe. Ruhl also advised that Canfield had contacted him on 9-12-74 and promised to furnish him a set of the photographs he has obtained in accordance with a promise he had made to Ruhl some time ago.

Memorandum of 9-12-74 from Mr. Downing to Mr. White reported that Laboratory examination of the photographs which were furnished to the Bureau by Donahue has led to the conclusion that Hunt and Sturgis are not identical with the

The Laboratory made copies of all the information furnished by Donahue, and the originals of the photographs and notes were returned to him on 9-13-74 by Bowers. Donahue had told Canfield he was going to have a contact examine the pictures but did not identify his contact. Donahue intends to tell Canfield that his contact does not believe the "bums" are identical with Hunt and Sturgis and that he does not want to become involved in this matter since he feels it is a situation which should be handled by the FBI.

Sam Jaffe

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised a Special Agent (SA) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), that the July 15, 1972 issue of "UPI Log", the house organ of United Press International, reflected that "Sam Jaffe Special UPI Correspondent has been granted a visa to visit China. He will arrive in early August and will file for the news wires, news pictures, and audio".

The source advised that Jaffe is not on the regular UPI staff, but has done free-lance work for the UPI, such as covering the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) with a tape recorder. It was the source's opinion that the visa from Mainland China was not arranged for Jaffe by the UPI as they would have sent somebody of more consequence, if they had been able to get a visa. The source also noted that during the UNGA, Jaffe leaned to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations for "behind the scene" type news rather than trying to be friendly with the new Chinese delegatinn.

The source described Jaffe as a former Moscow correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System, who is, or has had, numerous close contacts with Soviet nationals. Source statedthat Jaffe later worked as a correspondent for the American Broadcasting Company in Southeast Asia and also did free-lance work for UPI in New York.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of the FBI and is leaned to your agency; it and its contents are not to be distributed outside your agency.

## SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

On February 25, 1971, Samuel Adason Jaffe, a free lance correspondent was shown photographs of Boris V. Yarochevskiy, a correspondent for the Tass News Agency, an official Soviet news agency, and the latter's wife, Inna G. Yarochevskaya. Jaffe recognized the Yarochevskiys and recalled he had previously volunteered information concerning them.

(On April 29, 1969, Jaffe advised he met the Yarochevskiys at a Hungarian Embassy reception in Washington, D. C. (WDC) on April 17, 1969. Yarochevskaya had looked familiar to Jaffe. Yarochevskaya recognized Jaffe as having formerly been a correspondent in Moscow, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), and indicated that she had been one of the translators for the Reuters News Agency in Moscow working for John Miller, and that later she had been a translator for Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish newspaper correspondent and a friend of Jaffe.)

(On April 29, 1969, Jaffe indicated that Yarochevskiy was attending the Foreign Language Institute in Moscow while Yarochevskaya was working for Reuters. Later, YAROCHEVSKIY attended Mc Gill University in Canada, and his wife had flown from Moscow to meet her husband in Canada and they then traveled to the United States. On April 17, 1969, Yarochevskaya indicated that she and her husband had been in WDC for approximately a month and a half.)

(On May 14, 1969, Jaffe advised that recently he had had the Yarochevskiys to his residence for lunch. Present also were an American correspondent and the latter's wife.)

On February 25, 1971, Jaffe stated he has had no further contacts with Yarochevskaya, and has seen Yarochevskiy only once since he had them to his residence for lunch in May of 1969. Jaffe said he had seen Yarochevskiy in attendance at an anti-Vietnam war demonstration in Washington, D. C., in 1969, date unrecalled. Yarochevskiy was walking alone and carrying a camera, and it was not until he was right on top of the Soviet did Jaffe realize his identity. They exchanged only greetings. Yarochevskiy told Jaffe that they must get together sometime.

Jaffe stated he had never known Yarochevskiy prior to their meeting at the Hungarian Embassy reception on April 17, 1969. He had known Yarochevskaya previously, but only as one of a number of individuals whose services as translators, chauffeurs or house maids were made available to foreign correspondents assigned to Moscow by a Soviet government agency which Jaffe knew as "UPDK". It is Jaffe's impression now, that Yarochevskaya had been assigned by 'UPDK', as a translator, to Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish national and a correspondent for a Swedish newspaper, probably in 1965.

Jaffe recalled that both he and Bruger (phonetic) left Moscow in 1965. Jaffe now has the impression that Yarochevskaya was not married when he knew her in 1965. Jaffe did not know her socially. He did not know her by her maiden name. He recognized her at the Hungarian Embassy reception in 1969 but only after Yarochevskaya had refreshed his memory by recalling Moscow.

Jaffe said he believes that the "UPDK" was controlled by the KGB (Ministry of State Security); however, all of the persons employed by "UPDK" were not necessarily connected with Soviet intelligence. Jaffe stated he has no information that Yarochevskaya is, or was, connected with Soviet intelligence.

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Jaffe offered his opinion that Yarochevskaya may be connected with Soviet intelligence. He stated his opinion is influenced by the fact that in her 1965 employment as a translator in Moscow, Yarochevskaya had the opportunity of becoming acquainted with foreign correspondents assigned to Moscow. His opinion is influenced also by Yarochevskaya's subsequent marriage to a personable and younger Soviet who received an assignment to the United States as a Tass correspondent. Jaffe stated Yarochevskaya is the only Soviet national whom he knows who was employed by "UPDK" as a translator for foreign correspondents, who later came to the United States.

Jaffe stated that when he served in Moscow he and other foreign correspondents often heard references to a "Black Tass". The rumors were that the Tass News Agency abroad performed two functions. One was to gather news for dissemination to the Soviet people through Soviet newspapers and periodicals. The other, "Black Tass", was a form of intelligence gathering, the results of which were never made known to the Soviet people but were furnished directly to the KGB in Moscow for transmittal to Kremlin officials. Jaffe stated that an example of the "Black Tass" operation would be a Tass correspondent in Washington, D.C. feeling out his contacts to ascertain what the thinking of government officials might be in regard to some phase of the United States' foreign policy. Jaffe said that "Black Tass" would not necessarily relate to espionage.

Jaffe stated the only contact he has had in recent months with Soviet nationals occurred approximately in the end of January, 1971, exact date unrecalled. Jaffe had just stepped away from making a telephone call in the lobby of the Statler Hilton Hotel, 16th and K Streets, N. W., Washington, D. C., when Oleg M. Sokolov, a First Secretary, Soviet Embassy, walked into view. Sokolov greeted him warmly and asked Jaffe where he had been keeping himself and why no one had seen him. Jaffe replied that he has been in the Washington, D. C. area but that

he receives no invitations to Soviet Embassy receptions. Sokolov stated that that was not his (Sokolov's) fault and added that there "are two people who like you, Bubnov and I". Sokolov gave Jaffe his business card and said that they must get together.

Jaffe stated Sokolov was referring to Igor D. Bubnov, a Counselor, Soviet Embassy.

Jaffe stated that he does not intend to initiate any contacts with the Soviets.

### SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE
INTERNAL SECURITY - NORTH VIETNAM

On January 27, 1971, WF T-1, whose reliability is unknown, however, who is in a position to furnish reliable information, advised that he had received the following information concerning Samuel Adason Jaffe, a free-lance journalist and lecturer in the Washington, D. C. (WDC) area.

Samuel Adason Jaffe an acquaintance of one TRAN VAN DINH, former Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Embassy of Vietnam WDC, and currently employed as a free-lance researcher and lecturer, suggested to TRAN VAN DINH the possibility of arranging for a visit by an unidentified group of United States (U.S.) citizens to various camps in North Vietnam holding U.S. prisoners of war.

TRAN VAN DINH advised Jaffe that he would correspond with an acquaintance of his one LE CHAN, Director of Press Relations for the Embassy of North Vietnam in Paris, France, and set forth Jaffe's proposal. In addition, TRAN VAN DINH advised he would prepare a letter of introduction to LE CHAN which Jaffe could hand carry. This letter would also set forth the proposal of visiting the U.S. prisoners of war.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 190

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

On January 12, 1971, Jaffe arrived in Paris,
France, and contacted LE CHAN at which time it was suggested
to Jaffe that the proposal first be discussed with THICK
THIEN CHAU, President of the Association of Vietnamese
Buddhists in France.

Jaffe met with THICK THIEN CHAU for a two hour
luncheon engagement on January 12, 1971. THICK THIEN CHAU
was generally receptive to the proposal, however, he
suggested that the proposal be handled through the National
Liberation Front (NLF) representative in Paris, HA THANH
LAM. Jaffe was not immediately receptive to this; however,
THICK THIEN CHAU indicated that the possibility of any
success with his proposal would depend on this course of
action.

On January 14, 1971, at 10:30 a.m. Jaffe met with
HA THANH LAM, Director of Information, NLF, Paris, France;
however, due to a language barrier further discussions were
arranged for 4:30 p.m. that day when each could obtain the
services of a translator.

At 4:30 p.m. Jaffe returned to the offices of HA
THANH LAM with Ann/David an acquaintance of his from Sorbonne
University, Paris, France. HA THANH LAM had at his office
a Buddhist nun, THICK MAN DAXLA, who spoke excellent English
and who appeared to be very influential during the course of
discussion.

Jaffe emphasized to HA THANH LAM the great concern
of the people of the United States for the U.S. prisoners of
war in North Vietnamese prison camps and the necessity of
allowing an unbiased group, including himself, of U.S. citizens
to visit all the prisoners in all the camps and not just a
so-called "representative number who may have been brainwashed."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 191

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

After further discussion, the proposal was accepted by HA THANH LAM who advised that he would forward it to the proper North Vietnamese authorities, and Jaffe should again contact him.

On the following day Jaffe was advised that the proposal was accepted for consideration by the North Vietnamese representative in Paris and forwarded to Hanoi for their consideration. Additionally, Jaffe was advised not to expect an answer for at least four weeks.

He was unable to do this and had to go across the street and obtain passes. Source stated that he received the impression that the two unidentified Soviets were probably Beloborodko's superiors as he treated them with considerable deference and appeared to be uncomfortable in their presence.

November 2, 1962 with a group of Soviets to participate in
a meeting of prominent Soviets and Americans at Andover,
Massachusetts, at which time he was listed as interpreter;
and January 13-28, 1969 with a group of Soviets to parti-
cipate in the Dartmouth Conference, at which time he was des-
cribed as "Translator, Docent of 1st Moscow Institute of
Foreign Languages." (Shveitser also was in the United States
in 1970 with a Soviet group to attend the 20th International
Pugwash Conference, at which time he was described as Pro-
fessor, Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages.)

Source commented that he did not recognize the
individual depicted in the photographs of Shveitser and he
never heard of this individual; however, he expressed the
opinion that the large number of visits Shveitser has made
to the United States with a variety of Soviet groups suggests
he may be a KGB agent.

Source was asked if he knew of any connection of
Soviet poet Yevgeniy Yevtushenko with KGB. (Referenced memo-
randum dated September 30, 1970 indicates that during inter-
view of Samuel Adason Jaffe on September 24, 1970 concerning
his contacts with members of the Soviet group attending the
Pugwash Conference in 1970, Jaffe indicated he first met
Shveitser a number of years ago when Jaffe interviewed Soviet
poet Yevgeniy Yevtushenko with the assistance of Shveitser
during the Youth Festival in Helsinki, Finland.) Source

Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB "was contacting Yevtushenko, trying to influence him - to use" him; however, source indicated Bobkov was unsuccessful, and source described Yevtushenko as a "tough nut" to crack.

Source was advised that during a recent visit of Shveitser to the United States with the Soviet group to attend the 20th International Pugwash Conference, Shveitser reportedly roomed at a hotel in New York City with Mikhail Ilich Bruk, another member of this group. (Source previously identified Bruk as a KGB agent.) Source stated the fact that Bruk and Shveitser roomed together while traveling abroad does not necessarily indicate that Shveitser also is a KGB agent. He said it would appear more logical for a KGB agent to avoid associating too closely with another KGB agent. Source stated Bruk is of Jewish background and he described him as a "very sharp agent - clever agent - he wasn't ordinary informer."

Reference is made to memorandum dated September 16, 1970, reporting interview of Samuel Adason Jaffe concerning members of captioned group, and memorandum dated June 30, 1970, husband of Lyudmila Alekseyevna Gvishlani nee Kosygina, a member of captioned group.

On September 24, 1970, Jaffe telephonically advised he attended the party given on September 18, 1970, at the Harmony Club in New York City by members of the "Young Presidents of America" in honor of some members of captioned group. Jaffe indicated about ten couples attended the party and the only Soviets who attended were Mikhail Ilich Bruk, Aleksandr Davidovich Shveytser, and a young Soviet, about 27-28 years of age, whose name he could not recall, but who is the Novosti Press Agency (APM) representative in New York.

Jaffe indicated that almost immediately he "got off on the wrong foot" with fruk when he asked Bruk about his old friend, Yuriy Nikolaevich Vinogradov. Jaffe described Vinogradov as his closest Soviet friend and said that while employed at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations, Vinogradov "was running around with girls and Russia pulled him back;" however, he is still connected with the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Bruk replied "he and I don't see each other any more - we are not friends." When asked why, Bruk responded: "He called my cousin a dirty Jew."

Jaffe told Bruk he could not believe Vinogradov could possibly say anything like that. According to Jaffe, Bruk, who claims he is Jewish, is "always trying to convince American Jews there is no anti-Semitism in Russia." During the party, Bruk gave a long-winded speech and later Jaffe "sounded off" in a speech "and implied that he (Bruk) was the Soviet Union's House Jew." Jaffe indicated this incensed Bruk.

Jaffe noted that the Soviets are quite obvious in their efforts to convince foreigners they are not anti-Semitic. He was told by some of the "Young Fresidents of America" who recently toured the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) that the Soviets saw to it that Bruk escorted them and that their driver and their guides were Jewish. The Soviets did not encourage the group, all of whom were of Jewish origin, to visit any synagogues in the Soviet Union.

In an effort to convince Jaffe that the Soviets are not anti-Semitic, Bruk asked Jeffe if he was aware that the wife of Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev was Jewish. When Jaffe answered in the negative, Bruk insisted that not only is she Jewish but that "she has a heavy Jewish accent."

Bruk indicated he is now head of the English Sec- tion of APN and obtained this position through his friend, Boris (Sergeyevich) Burkov, former head of APN. Bruk added that Burkov subsequently was demoted; however, this has not affected his own career in APN and be conveyed the impression his job is very secure. Bruk stated he has thirteen people working under him, all of whom he had "handpicked." Bruk commented that Georgiy Bolshakov is no longer working for AFN, having been discharged because of heavy drinking.

(WF T-L, a former officer of the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB) whose bona fides has not been

established but who has furnished reliable information in the past, identified Georgiy Nikitovich Bolshakov as a Colonel in GRU (Soviet Military Intelligence) who in 1962-63 worked under cover as a department chief in APN.)

In Jaffe's opinion, Bruk has always been a "name-dropper" and during his conversation with Jaffe, Bruk mentioned seeing or hearing from several American millionaire friends of his. Bruk indicated he had contacted, apparently telephonically, Armand Hammer, head of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, in Los Angeles. He claimed to be in touch with Charles Stewart Mott, philanthropist and former General Motors Corporation executive; with industralist Cyrus Eaton, and with a Vice President of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, name not recalled, who lives in a plush apartment on 5th Avenue in New York City.

Following the party, Jaffe invited Bruk and Shveytser to dinner and visited Bruk and Shveytser in the hotel room they shared at the Warwick Hotel on 6th Avenue in New York City. While there, Shveytser said the girl from whom Bruk expected a telephone call had not phoned. Bruk replied he was very anxious to hear from the girl, mentioning to Jaffe that he would like to have intimate relations with her, but he did not mention her name.

Jaffe recalled that in Moscow Bruk had the reputation of being a "girl chaser." During his current trip to the United States, Bruk showed Jaffe a photograph of his wife, Helen, and their daughter; and did not mention he had divorced Helen and remarried. Jaffe indicated he previously heard from members of the "Young Presidents of America" who visited the Soviet Union that Bruk had divorced his first wife and remarried, and had introduced members of the American group to his new wife.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 208

Bruk asked Jaffe about his current activities and Jaffe indicated he was doing some free-lance writing and giving lectures. In response to Bruk's questions, Jaffe said his lectures are arranged by American Program Bureau, whose main office is located in Boston, Massachusetts, and he normally receives a lecture fee of $750 less expenses but some times get $750 plus expenses per lecture. When asked if he lectures on the USSR, Jaffe told Bruk very few people are now interested in this topic and he generally lectures about Southeast Asia, Vietnam and Cambodia. Bruk appeared to be greatly impressed by the amount of Jaffe's lecture fees and he asked Jaffe: "Could you arrange (speaking) tours for me?" When the letter hesitated, Druk indicated he felt sure that even though he is a Communist, United States authorities would permit him to visit the United States for a lecture tour. Jaffe suggested that Bruk contact the American Program Bureau of Boston and Colsen Lee of New York City, pointing out that they are managers in this field. Bruk appeared genuinely interested in lecturing in the United States and Jaffe commented he would not be at all surprised to see him appearing as a guest lecturer at United States universities. Bruk indicated he had visited the United States last year, and expected to come again, possibly next year, when he expects to make an inspection tour of all Novosti bureaus abroad.

In discussing Aleksandr Shveytser, Jaffe indicated he first met Shveytser a number of years ago in Helsinki when Jaffe interviewed the Soviet poet Yevgeniy Yevtushenko with the assistance of Shveytser during the Youth Festival in Helsinki. Source described Shveytser as head of the English Department at the Foreign Language Institute; a "very nice guy." very humble and reserved in his conduct. Bruk, by contrast, he considers a vain, boastful, "name-dropping" individual whom he finds quite distasteful. While the three vere eating dinner, Bruk commented that Shveytser was connected

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 209

SECRET

with KGB (Soviet Committee for State Security). It was obvious to Jaffe that Shveytser was very much upset by Bruk's statement. Jaffe told Bruk his statement was ridiculous per se adding that Shveytser was a very scholarly individual who rarely had contacts with foreigners. Bruk replied facetiously that this was the type of person KGB used; however, Jaffe got the impression Bruk vas not sincere in his comments about Shveytser.

Jaffe said he inquired of Bruk concerning several of his Soviet contacts and the latter replied: "I don't see.. them any more." Shveytser asked Bruk why he still was friendly with him (Shveytser) when he had failed to retain many of his other friends. Brukar replied: "Well, you don't goad me and don't ride all over me." Shveytser replied: "I have let you have it on occasion when you are wrong." Jaffe added that although Bruk is a sharp individual, Shveytser is on a much higher intellectual plane, and expressed the opinion that Bruk probably did not fully comprehend many of Shveytser's comments.

Jaffe stated he has always been convinced that Bruk was a member of or "very close" to KGB and claims to have frequently warned his American associates to be careful of their contacts with Bruk since he was "always probing and pick- ing your brains and reporting back" to KGB.

Jaffe learned from Bruk that Lyudmila Alekseyevna Gvishiani, daughter of Soviet leader Alexey Kosygin, would not depart the United States with the captioned group but would remain in the United States to do research. Jaffe understood she was a historian. He added that unlike some members of captioned group, who reside in hotels during their tour, Lyudmila Gvishiani lives at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations (SMUN) in New York City. Jaffe learned

5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 210

SECRET

that Grishiani vas interviewed by a reporter of a Milwaukee, Wisconsin newspaper possibly the "Milwaukee Journal." She was willing to talk about the United States and her reaction to the United States, but she would not discuss her father. Jeffe indicated he informed a newspaper friend in New York that Gvishiani was staying at the SMUNI however, he does not know whether or not his friend succeeded in interviewing Gvishiani.

By communication of August 17, 1970, the United States Department of State (USDS) advised that among the Soviets who were issued visas to enter the United States to attend the 20th International Pugwash Conference, Chicago, Illinois, September 9-15, 1970 are:

Georgiy Arkadyevich Arbatov, born May 19, 1923, Kherson, described as Director, Institute of USA (United States of America), USSR Academy of Sciences;

Mikhail Ilich Bruk, born September 22, 1929, Leningrad, described as "Chief Editor of News Agency;"

Lyudmila Alekseyevna Gvishiani, born November 4, 1928, Kirensk, described as Senior Researcher, Institute of USA, USSR Academy of Sciences;

Aleksandr Davidovich Shveytser, born December 8, 1923, Moscow, described as Professor, Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages.

During interview of WF T-1 by Special Agents of the FBI, source was shown the photographs and limited bio- graphic data of Soviets who applied for visas to enter the United States with captioned group. Source indicated he knew only Arbatov, Bruk and Lyudmila Gvishiani. Source

Source indicated he was personally acquainted with Lyudmila Gvishiani nee Kosygina, since her family and scurce's family were friendly. Source's mother and Gvishlani's mother were quite close and Lyudmila Gvishiani also attended the Institute of International Relations. Source commented that the photograph of Gvishiani indicates she has aged somewhat; however, the photograph is a good likeness of her. In commenting on Bruk, source identified him as a KGB agent, and noted that he is now listed as a Chief Editor of APN. Source remarked he formerly was an employee of the International Department of the Soviet Ministry of Health and a very capable agent, "and he was writing his information (reports for KGB).good." Source indicated that although Bruk had some type of medical education, his work in the Ministry of Health dealt "with international relations" and source indicated that his present work probably is not very much different than his former work with the Ministry of Health.

SECRET

Washington, D.C. 20535
September 15, 1970

By communication of August 17, 1970, the U.S. Department of State advised that among the Soviets invited to attend captioned conference were Mikhail Ilich Bruk, born September 22, 1929, Leningrad, described as "Chief Editor of News Agency," and Lyudmila Alekseyevna Gvishiani, born November 4, 1928, Kirensk, described as "Senior Researcher, Institute of U.S.A., USSR Academy of Sciences" and daughter of Soviet Premier Aleksey Nikolayevich Kosygin.

On September 15, 1970, Samuel Adason Jaffe (hereinafter referred to as source), former American Broadcasting Company (ABC) correspondent in Moscow, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), who now resides in Bethesda, Maryland, telephonically advised a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that he had been invited to a party to be given on Friday, September 18, 1970, at about 8 p.m., at the Harmony Club in New York City, for Mikhail Bruk, a Soviet national currently visiting the United States with a Soviet group which includes the daughter of Soviet Premier Kosygin.

Source stated he received a call the night of September 14, 1970, from a very close friend, Jeff Jaffe, President of Ward Candy Company, extending an invitation for source and wife to attend the party. Source said Jeff Jaffe is not a relative of source, however, source's father at one time represented the Ward Candy Company. Jeff Jaffe is one of a group of American millionaires referred to as "Young Presidents of America," which recently visited the USSR. Before making the trip, source told Jeff Jaffe he might be contacted in the USSR by some of source's former Soviet acquaintances, including Mikhail Bruk. Source informed Jeff Jaffe that Bruk has acted as an interpreter for Americans in Moscow and has attended a number of Pugwash Conferences as an interpreter, and source indicated he suspected Bruk was connected with the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 214

RE:

SECRET

After his return from the USSR, Jeff Jaffe told source that during a portion of the tour of the "Young Presidents of America" in the USSR, they were escorted by Mikhail Bruk. Source was told that "at one point in an elevator in the Ukraine," Bruk mentioned source's name to Jeff Jaffe and asked if source was a relative or friend of his. When Jeff Jaffe informed Bruk that they were close friends, but not related, Bruk asked Jeff Jaffe if he would mind taking a letter or note to source. Jeff Jaffe indicated he would be glad to do so, however, they parted that day and he did not see Bruk again for a couple of weeks. Just prior to his departure from the USSR, Jeff Jaffe met Bruk again and reminded Bruk of the letter to source, pointing out that he would be leaving the USSR very shortly, however, Jeff Jaffe got the impression he "was talking to a dummy." Bruk gave absolutely no indication that he recalled ever requesting him to deliver a letter or note to source.

Source stated that when Jeff Jaffe called him September 14, 1970, and extended him the invitation to attend the party for Bruk at the Harmony Club, which source referred to as a very exclusive Jewish club, source inquired if Bruk was aware that source might attend the party. Source was told Bruk should not be aware of this. Source indicated he would be in New York City on business Wednesday, September 16, 1970, and might stay over to attend the party that Friday. He indicated his wife would not be able to attend because she has to remain home with their children.

Source indicated he has observed no indication that Bruk has attempted to contact him during Bruk's current visit to the United States; however, source noted that he and his wife were out of town the previous weekend and would not be aware if Bruk attempted to call him during that period.

In answer to a specific question, source indicated he does not know whether or not KGB would have been aware that he was a close friend of Jeff Jaffe prior to the latter's trip to the USSR. Source stated it is possible during his assignment in Moscow as ABC correspondent that he could have mentioned Jeff Jaffe to Mikhail Bruk. He said it also is possible that Bruk asked Jeff Jaffe about him merely because both have the same surname.

RE:

SECRET

During an interview on July 25, 1969, by Special Agents of the FBI, WF T-1, a former officer of the KGB whose bona fides has not been established, but who has furnished reliable information in the past, identified Mikhail Ilich Bruk as an employee of the International Department of the Soviet Ministry of Health and a KGB agent "of one of apparatus of one of regions of Moscow." Although not an agent of the Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, Bruk knew several doctors stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and Bruk was used by officers of the First (American Embassy) Section, First Department, SCD, in their operations against American doctors stationed at the U.S Embassy in Moscow.

WF T-2, another government agency which conducts intelligence investigations, advised that WF T-1 furnished the following handwritten comments concerning his knowledge of the KGB operation against Samuel Adason Jaffe:

"Sam Jaffee, an American correspondent, arrived in Moscow in 1961. The Chief of the 1st Section, 1st Department (Vladislav Mikhaylovich Kovshuk, settled a question with 10th (Correspondents) Department, 2nd Chief Directory (Directorate), that the 1st Department would be working against Jaffee. I remember that he acquainted with a ballet dancer from Finland who was finishing her studies in Moscow and he was even thinking about his marriage with her. At that time we were thinking about a recruitment of this girl and I through (Johann) Preisfreund (identified by WF T-1 as a Finnish businessman and a KGB agent) became acquainted with her. As I found out there was not a sense (useless) as she was going to return to Finland or to Sweden.

"In 1962-1963 I found out from Kovshuk (and Gennadiy Ivanovich) Gryaznov (identified by WF T-1 as an officer of the 1st Section, 1st Department, SCD, KGB) that a senior case officer of the 1st Section, 1st Department, Kuskov, Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich was working with Sam Jaffee. I don't know (if) he was an agent or an operative contact. I am not sure but it seems to me that he was approached on the basis (of being) connected with women."

"In March 1962 I have seen Sam Jaffee in Geneva. He with other correspondents visited a pair of times the Soviet representative there. He knew. several. Russian diplomats and among them Suslov, Vladimir (Vladimir Pavlovich Suslov; identified by WF T-l as a Soviet diplomat and KGB operative contact)."

During interviews of Samuel Adason Jaffe by Special Agents of the FBI during March and April 1969, he identified from photographs of numerous Soviets who had been mentioned by WF T-1 as KGB agents, operative contacts or officers, the following as his Soviet contacts -
Mikhail Bruk, Vladimir Pavlovich Suslov, Vladislav Mikhaylovich Kovshuk and Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov (known to Jaffe as "Slava"). Jaffe denied ever knowingly being a KGB agent although he stated "Slava" might have thought that he (Jaffe) was "Slava's" agent. Jaffe stated he never told "Slava" or any other Soviet connected with Soviet Intelligence anything other than his own observations and opinions and denied furnishing any information from any government documents. Jaffe indicated that after the defection of WF T-1 was reported in newspapers, "Slava" told Jaffe he had worked with him ("Slava") and knew several of his contacts, including Jaffe. "Slava" then told Jaffe "If you are ever asked anything about me, deny any knowledge of me." Jaffe emphatically denied "Slava" ever made any arrangements to get in touch with Jaffe after Jaffe left the USSR and Jaffe denied ever having contact with "Slava" after his departure from the USSR.

JAFFE advised that the interview, if granted would be presonally conducted by him and would generally cover such subjects as crime in America, civil rights and the future of the FBI. The date and place of the interview would be at the discretion of the Director.[^1]

JAFFE was advised by SA THEISEN that these requests are handled directly by the Bureau and any correspondence should be so directed.[^1]

As indicated in Bureau files, JAFFE was considered by the KGB to be one of their agents and his recent contacts with the Soviets remain suspicious.

On September 18, 1969, subject contacted SA ELBERT T. TURNER by telephone and advised that he had been in New York the previous week where he had accidently met VLADIMIR ALEKSANDROVICH CHUCHUKIN, First Secretary of the Soviet United Nations Delegation at the delegates lounge. Subject said that he had known CHUCHUKIN for about ten years and mentioned to CHUCHUKIN that he was currently looking for a job. They made a luncheon date for the following day (9/11/69) for which CHUCHUKIN was late. They met at the lounge but went to another restaurant to eat at CHUCHUKIN's suggestion. During the luncheon, there was no conversation which would suggest that CHUCHUKIN was making any kind of intelligence follow up.

Subject stated that he had not had any further contact with BORIS SEDOV and occasionally sees BORIS STRELNIKOV, who resides in his apartmenthouse, but merely exchanges greetings with him. Subject indicated that there has been no further indication of Soviet intelligence follow up with him.

Subject stated that he was going back to New York the following week and is still looking for a job.

An extra copy of this letter is submitted for the Bureau (105-94406) and New York (105-45740) files on CHUCHUKIN.

NY T-1 advised that Sam Jaffe, former American
Broadcasting Company (ABC) news correspondent in Hong Kong,
was present at the United Nations on September 9, 1969.
Source learned that Jaffe is no longer employed by ABC
and is presently seeking a new journalistic affiliation.

Source indicated that Jaffe is interested in some
type of news agency being established in Europe by Simon
Malley.

Simon Malley, who has also been known as
Simon Menache (true name), Selim Malek and
Selim Menache, was born May 25, 1923, at

During November, 1962, NY T-2, another

Malley was possibly identical with a paid

agent. Malley has been an accredited news
correspondent at United Nations Headquarters,
New York, representing a number of African
and Arab news media. In 1967 Malley published
a series of articles in the United States
concerning travel to China, and in particular
about the results of an interview with Chinese
Communist Premier CHOU En-lai.

Jaffe was heard to comment that he has been interested
in traveling to the Chinese mainland. He noted that he had

ReWFO let and LHM 4/29/69; WFO airtel and enclosure dated 5/1/69/under caption IS - CH"; and WFO let and LHM dated 5/2/69

The NYO agrees with WFO's conclusion that former
was an agent of the KGB during his service as an ABC Television correspondent in Moscow from 1961 - 1965. While he may not have considered himself as such, there is no doubt the KGB regarded him as their agent. His contacts with Soviet nationals since leaving Moscow in October, 1965, are of such nature that it is not possible to conclude whe- ther or not he continues to serve KGB interests. As noted by WFO, the call he received recently from BORIS SEDOV of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D. C., indicating SEDOV's desire to show him a photograph is suspicious and could well represent a KGB attempt to re-establish the former agent re- lationship with him.

WFO's impression of former
as an aggressive type, a fast talker and a smooth operator is an accurate description and constitutes his basic qualifications for his professional capacity, that of a television reporter-correspondent. His former affinity for Russian matters led him into numerous contacts with Soviet nationals here in the United States and resulted in his being posted to Moscow in 1961. Following his expulsion from the Soviet Union and his subsequent posting to Hong Kong, former turned his attention toward the Red Chinese. He undoubtedly views rela- tions with Red China as the future primary concern of the United States and wants to be "in on the ground floor", so to speak. While this desire, in and of itself, does not reflect

/ unfavorably upon former and is understandable for
one in his position, the possibility that he could be used
by the Red Chinese, as he was by the Soviets, should always
be borne in wind.

faith in his ability to "handle" the Soviets and probably
feels the same way now towards the Red Chinese, but his
personal conduct, especially in the past, has placed him in
a position to be rather easily compromised. The NYO sus-
pects there are still areas of his conduct and activities
while in Moscow which he has not revealed. - S-

CIA's interest in is undoubtedly
based on the possibility of his getting into Red China at
some future date. CIA is aware of background and the Bureau's dealings with him and is therefore
forewarned. - S-

In view of the above, the NYO agrees with WFO
that no effort should be made by the Bureau at this time to
direct the activities ofor or to give him
any assignments. Any information he might volunteer con-
cerning his contacts with Soviet, Soviet-bloc or Red Chinese
nationals (or their agents) should, however, be accepted and
evaluated. He has furnished information of value in the past
and could well do the same in the future. -S-

SECRET

INTERNAL SECURITY - CH

On April 29, 1969, a confidential source, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised he had been informed of the following information by Samuel Jaffe, identified below:

Samuel Adason Jaffe, American Broadcasting Company correspondent, recently learned of Dr. Paul Lin, a professor at McGill University, Montreal, Canada, Subsequently, Jaffe obtained additional information concerning LIN from a long-time friend, Mr. H. H. CHANG, a professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University, New Jersey, and from VAN LUNG, one of the owners of the Yenching Palace Restaurant, 3524 Connecticut Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D. C., with whom Jaffe dined in April, 1969.

On April 8, 1969, Jaffe telephonically contacted LIN advising Lin that he had recently seen a New York Times article dealing with the restoration of Canada-China diplomatic relations and in which LIN's name appeared. Jaffe informed LIN that he had been in Hong Kong for about four years and was desirous of interviewing LIN. Additionally, Jaffe informed LIN that he had interviewed CHOU En-lai in 1955 and was one of about 18 journalists invited to visit the China Mainland in 1956. Jaffe also advised LIN that he knew one SZETO KUNG of the New China News Agency in Hong Kong.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 235

SECRET

LIN advised Jaffe to contact him later at which time he would have a definite answer as to a possible interview.

On April 18, 1969, Jaffe recontacted LIN telephonically at which time LIN indicated a reluctance to grant an interview with Jaffe, feeling that granting such an interview would leave the door open to interviews by many other journalists. LIN, however, indicated a desire to talk with Jaffe and after exchanging telephone numbers and addresses a luncheon engagement was set for April 28, 1969, at the faculty lounge at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.

On April 28, 1969, Jaffe flew to Montreal and met LIN for lunch as previously arranged. Jaffe expressed to LIN his strong desire to visit the China Mainland as a correspondent and suggested that it might be possible that the Chinese Government would permit foreign journalists to enter the China Mainland in connection with the October celebrations. LIN expressed the opinion that the October celebrations would make no difference in the Government's policy concerning the admittance of journalists. LIN suggested that Jaffe write a letter by the first of June, 1969, to the Chinese Government indicating that he desired to enter the China Mainland as a private citizen, stating that he had interviewed CHOU En-lai in 1955 as an American journalist and that if he is permitted to enter China, he would like to continue to pursue his career as a journalist.

LIN indicated that the best way to establish contact would be through the Chinese Embassy in Paris; however, when Jaffe indicated that he knew no one there and the possibility existed that the letter would not be forwarded to the proper channels LIN stated he would "Be going East in early summer" and he would be willing to see to it that the letter would be properly dispatched. LIN also suggested that Jaffe's letter be sent to him for perusal prior to its dispatch as he possibly could be of assistance in wording the letter correctly. LIN emphasized that Jaffe should indicate in his letter that he was writing as a private citizen; however, he should not try to hide that fact that he is a journalist and state in the letter that he had previously been a journalist for "The Nation" and that he would like to write and produce films about China.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 236

SECRET

LIN also stated that Jaffe should include in his letter the fact that he would be willing to leave his United States Passport in Hong Kong and when Jaffe indicated to LIN that he did not think that would be necessary, LIN stated that maybe "they would not want you to come into China with a U.S. Passport." -S-

According to Jaffe, LIN is a very brilliant individual well-versed in Soviet-Chinese relations and in United States relations with China and the Soviet Union. LIN appeared to be more concerned with Sino-Soviet relations than with the United States. LIN commented that Cyrus Eaton is very much interested in bringing China and the United States together and stated that Eaton had sent him an article from a Cleveland newspaper on anti-China hysteria whipping up in the United States. -S-

In commenting on the recent newspaper accounts of the speech of LIN Piao, Vice Primier, Communist China, LIN stated that he thought it was premature to make any judgment on the speech in its entirety; however, LIN ranked MAO Tse-tung, CHOU En-lai, and LIN Piao almost equally. LIN stated that he did not for a minute think that they believe the United States or the Soviet Union would launch an atomic attack. They do believe the Soviet Union is a serious threat but they do not think either the United States or the Soviet Union plan to launch a premature attack on them. In talking about moderates, LIN stated that CHOU En-lai is not a moderate; he is a tactician. LIN stated that MAO probably is the only man who really understands the Chinese people and believed MAO felt he had to start the Cultural Revolution because there were people in China who were doing things for their own self interest and MAO had to take action, including the unleashing of the Red Guard to prevent this. LIN indicated that he felt MAO has been successful. LIN stated that the Soviet Union is much like the United States but MAO knew -S-


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 237

SECRET

that if these people were allowed to gain a foothold that China would revert to the days of CHIANG Kai-shek when there was unlimited corruption and he felt this had to be settled once and for all. LIN stated that MAO, CHOU, .and LIN Piao were unanimous and there was no disagreement among them.

LIN stated to Jaffe that he would not set foot in the United States until the Vietnam war was ended; however, later when LIN asked Jaffe if he was aware of the fact that he (LIN) had been in Hong Kong in January, 1969, and Jaffe replied in the affirmative, LIN stated "I am sorry, I am not being completely honest. You know that I was in Seattle." LIN then explained that en route from Hong Kong to Canada he decided to return through Seattle to Canada against the advice of his friends in Hong Kong who indicated that there might be trouble. LIN stated that he was detained at the airport (Seattle) for two hours, was interrogated, and all personal effects were gone through. LIN stated he was sure everything was photographed and he was furious. LIN stated that he subsequently contacted an attorney, "the number one professor of law at Harvard University," who was also incensed over the incident.

LIN inquired of Jaffe if he knew other news correspondents, such as Harrison Salisbury, Doak Barnett, or Frank Trader. LIN indicated that he knew Salisbury well and stated that he was sure Salisbury would speak well of him (LIN). LIN also discussed Mortin Schafer, Canadian correspondent, who entered China as a tourist and who apparently concealed a camera in a cigarette lighter to take photographs in China. Jaffe indicated that that was unfortunate as it has made it more difficult for foreign journalists to obtain permission to enter China. In commenting on correspondent Milton Nash, LIN stated that he thought Nash was "bright and understanding."

LIN was shown a United States newspaper article concerning China and LIN expressed a desire to have a copy of that article. Jaffe promised to send him a copy of the article.

Jaffe indicated to LIN that he intended to remain in contact with him and would forward to LIN his request of the Chinese Government for permission to enter the China Mainland.

SUBJECT: IS - R

DATE: 5/26/69

On 5/14/69 subject telephonically contacted SA ELBERT T. TURNER. He said he had a rather interesting lunch with the Press Attache of the Hungarian Embassy, JOZSEM HAJDU (3rd Secretary, Press Department). HAJDU, who arranged for the luncheon, indicated he was interested in what President NIXON would speak about in his national TV broadcast. He asked subject when he would get an "advance" of the speach, and subject said he did not think ABC (American Broadcast Company) would get one until a half hour prior to the start of the broadcast.

HAJDU also asked subject if he was aware of a report put out by the Institute for Strategic Studies at Georgetown University, Washington, D.C. about the situation in Europe and if subject could obtain a copy of it. HAJDU said he thought subject would find the report interesting to read. HAJDU also inquired about a report just issued by Senator KENNEDY's Office containing comments of scientists against the ABM project. Subject told HAJDU he was not aware of it.

Subject also advised he had lunch with BORIS (VALENTINOVICH) YAROCHEVSKIY, new"Tass" correspondent, and his wife, INNA YAROCHEVSKAYA, DON WINSTON and his wife also attended the lunch, held at subject's residence. Also invited but not attending was ANATOLI KARTOOF (phonetic) (undoubtedly ANATOLIY PAVLOVICH KOTOV, Attache, Press Department, Soviet Embassy). Subject complained

to YAROCHEVSKIY about his failure to attend and the next day
KARTOOF (KOTOV) apologized telephonically, indicating he had
mixed up his dates.

In answer to a specific question, subject stated he
had not been in contact with BORIS SEDOV, stating "I never heard
another word from him." Subject stated he received an invitation
to attend a reception at the Hungarian Embassy on 5/23/69 and
suggested that SEDOV "may show up there." Subject said he did
not receive an invitation to the "May Day" reception at the
Soviet Embassy. He called and mentioned this to ANATOLI KARTOOF
(KOTOV), who stated invitations were limited to one press
representative for each press service, but told subject that
if he wanted to attend, "please feel free to do so." Subject
stated he refused to accept the invitation under such circumstances.

Subject indicated he was "leaving here on Friday"
(5/16/69) for New York and will be "looking around to see what
is in the hopper"; however, he will return to Washington, D.C.
by 5/23/69 since his daughter has a birthday then.

On 5/20/69 JACK STENT, CIA, advised SA LYLE J. THEISEN
that subject had resigned from ABC effective 5/16/69.

Reference is made to memorandum dated April 29, 1969
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Washington, D.C.
concerning captioned individual.

## Interview, April 16, 1969

On April 16, 1969, Samuel Adason Jaffe telephonically
furnished the following information to an Agent of the Washington
Field Office (FBI).

### Party Given by Jaffe, Attended by Hungarian and Polish nationals

Jaffe stated he recently held a party at his residence
which was attended by a representative of the Hungarian News
Agency, the Hungarian Press Attache, and the Polish Press Attache,
whom he identified as Andrej Konopacki and described as a "hard-
nosed" individual in his political outlook.

## Attempts to Contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov

Jaffe said he had attempted on three or four occasionss
to telephonically contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov at the Soviet
Embassy, but was unable "to catch him in." He left word with the
Soviet Embassy on one or two occasions for Sedov to contact him.

(Sedov has been reported to be a KGB officer. Jaffe
previously advised that Sedov told him that while
thumbing through "our photograph files" he found
a photograph of Jaffe taken in Moscow interviewing
a Russian. Sedov indicated he thought Jaffe might
want the photograph and suggested that they get
together for lunch soon.)

## Farewell Party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev

Jaffe advised that next week he will attend the going-
away party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev, Novosti Press Agency
(APN) correspondent..

(Bogachev has been reported as connected with
Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU). The Novosti

SECRET

Press Agency was newly established in Russia in February, 1961.)

Contact with Vladimir Nikiforovich Vashchenko

Jaffe stated he attended the Hungarian Independence Day reception. He arrived late and spent considerable time talking to Captain Vladimir Nikiforovich Vashchenko, Naval Attache assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. Vashchenko indicated he did not think the dispute between Russia and China will mean anything. He does not see any real trouble now between the two countries. According to Jaffe, Vashchenko did not "spout" the "Soviet line." Jaffe said this was the first time he was able to get a Soviet military man to talk to him for any length of time.

(Vashchenko has been reported as connected with GRU.)

Interview, April 22, 1969

On April 22, 1969, Jaffe telephonically furnished the following information to an Agent of the WFO, FBI.

Contact with Vladimir Fedorovich Petrovskiy

Jaffe said he recently visited New York City in connection with his interest in interviewing a Chinese professor at McGill University in Canada and had a long conversation with Vladimir Fedorovich Petrovskiy and his wife, Mira Mikhailovna Petrovskaya. He also had contact with a Soviet named Loginov who used to be with the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow.

(Petrovskiy has been identified as connected with KGB.)

Attempt to Contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov

Jaffe also stated he "was invited up to the Hungarian Embassy" and while there he asked a Soviet Press Officer, "Where

is Sedov? He said, 'He doesn't work for me. He is in the Information Department.'" Jaffe continued: "They (Soviets) just say he isn't in. He has been in New York."

## Contact with new Tass News Agency Comespondent

Jaffe also indicated he recently met a newly arrived "Tass" correspondent whom he described as "sort of Ivy League," and his wife, whom he described as a "very attractive blond girl who remembered me from Moscow." Jaffe initially did not remember her but later recalled she was a translator for Reuters News Agency in Moscow and later worked for a Swedish correspondent in Moscow who is a friend of Jaffe. Jaffe remarked this couple has only been in the United States about a month.

## Interview, April 29, 1969

On April 29, 1969, Jaffe telephoned an agent of the WFO, FBI and on the same date voluntarily appeared at the WFO for interview.

## Farewell Party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev

Jaffe advised he attended a farewell party for Bogachev at the Aviation Club. According to Jaffe, Bogachev appeared to be "very cold" and "a little stiff" in his contact with Jaffe. Jaffe asked him what he intended to do and he replied: "I might go back to 'Tass.'" Jaffe indicated the Soviets gave Bogachev an "atmosphere weather gauge" as a farewell gift.

## Attempt to Contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov

Jaffe said Sedov has not yet returned his calls. Jaffe again indicated he met a Soviet Press Officer at a Hungarian reception (later he said he met him at the Aviation Club party) who told him Sedov was not in his department but was connected with the Soviet Information Department at the Soviet Embassy. The

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 248

SECRET

# SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Press Officer indicated Sedov had been in New York but was now back in Washington, D.C. The Press Officer told Jaffe he would tell Sedov to get in touch with Jaffe. According to Jaffe, the Press Officer, whose name he cannot recall, displayed great interest in Jaffe and "practically begged" Jaffe to invite him to his home. The Soviet stated: "You haven't forgotten? You said you would have me over. You are a great fellow. You will have me over?" Jaffe said he replied in the affirmative. According to Jaffe, the Soviet "made very sure I knew he was Jewish, which was very obvious." Jaffe associates the Soviet's name with the Russian word for "potato."

Boris Valentinovich Yarochevskiy, "Tass" Correspondent, and his wife, Inna Grigoryevna Yarochevskaya

Jaffe said he attended a Hungarian reception April 17, 1969 which also was attended by several Soviet journalists. The Soviets spent considerable time during the reception, which was held just after the United States "spy" plane was shot down by the North Koreans, in conversation with Bob McCloskey of the United States Department of State.

Jaffe continued: "I met this young guy - the newest arrival from 'Tass' - Boris (last name unknown) (LNU) and Inna (his wife)." Jaffe described Boris as "very, very Ivy League" and "quite bright." Inna, who looked familiar to Jaffe, came over to Jaffe and stated: "Sam, how are you? You don't remember me? No? You are still a legend in Moscow. There is still talk about you." Inna then indicated that she was one of the translators for Reuters News Agency in Moscow, working for John Miller. Her last job was translator for Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish newspaper correspondent in Moscow and a friend of Jaffe.

Jaffe stated Boris apparently studied at McGill University in Canada and Inna apparently joined her husband in Canada just prior to his assignment in Washington, D.C. Inna indicated she and Boris have only been in Washington, D.C. about one or one and one-half months.

SECRET

Jaffe said Inna "is more outgoing than the others (Soviets)." Both Boris and Inna speak good English. Jaffe indicated that Boris was going to the Foreign Language Institute in Moscow while Inna was working for Reuters News Agency. He said John Miller, Inna's boss, knew Boris. Jaffe stated Boris followed up his studies at the Foreign Language Institute by attending McGill University. He said Inna flew from Moscow to meet Boris in Canada and they then flew to the United States.

Jaffe said Boris, while studying at McGill University, met a Chinese professor at McGill University whom Jaffe interviewed at McGill University on April 28, 1969. According to Jaffe, this Chinese professor is closely connected with, if not a part of, the Chinese Communist Government.

Jaffe said he learned from Inna that Yuri Nikolaevich Vinogradov, a contact of Jaffe in Moscow and in the United States, is now divorced.

Contact with Vladimir Fedorovich Petrovskiy and (first name unknown) (FNU) Loginov (Possibly Vadim Petrovich Loginov)

Jaffe stated: "I went to New York and called Vladimir Petrovskiy and his wife, Mira, whom I have known for years. We had lunch at 'The Plaza' and had a long relaxing conversation."

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 250

SECRET

# SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Jaffe said he mentioned to Petrovskiy that Inna had told him Yuri Vinogradov is now divorced. Although Petrovskiy did not acknowledge that he was aware of this, he stated he was not surprised since he knew he had separated from his wife. Yuri Vinogradov is now in the "World Organization Department" of the Soviet Foreign Ministry as "an assistant to an assistant." Jaffe got the impression that Vinogradov's job is not important.

Petrovskiy mentioned that Viktor Mikhailovich Sukhodrev and his wife also are now divorced. Jaffe said she had been in "show business." Jaffe continued: "Viktor decided he wanted a diplomatic career. He is working in the Foreign Ministry, but whenever they need a translator, they grab him." Petrovskiy indicated Sukhodrev is not happy with his new job because he likes to travel and "be a big shot." While working at the Foreign Ministry, Sukhodrev occasionally is used as an interpreter in important cases.

Petrovskiy indicated that Vladimir Pavlovich Suslov is now "what you would call policy planner for United States affairs at the Foreign Ministry. He has the title of Ambassador. He has a very important job now."

(Suslov has been identified by WF T-2, a former KGB officer whose bona fides has not been established but who has furnished reliable information in the past, as a Soviet diplomat who is an operative contact of KGB.)

Jaffe said he learned from Petrovskiy that Yuri Nikolaevich Chernyakov, Press Officer, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C., might be recalled. He also learned that Mikhail Nikolaevich Smirnovskiy, who used to be Chief of the American Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry "is ill" and has been replaced as Ambassador to England. Jaffe got the impression it was a "political illness."

Jaffe said Mira Petrovskaya is now working for the Aeroflot Section of Intourist in New York because "she decided she would keep herself busy."

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 251

# SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

SECRET

Jaffe continued: "Petrovskiy was concerned because 'The Washington Post' is on a deliberate kick to defame him." Jaffe indicated Petrovskiy has been accused of being responsible for the Soviet Union using the United Nations (UN) for its own advantage. Jaffe stated: "He (Petrovskiy) admits he made a mistake. He thought because it was made public and was given to a group, he was able to publish it, and this has caused embarrassment for the UN." Petrovskiy told Jaffe that "Robert Esterbrook has had two articles sort of attacking me. I admit I made a mistake. I was wrong. I told the Secretary General (of the UN) this. I didn't know you had a group through which this should be cleared. Why should this man continue to attack me? Two articles in 'The Washington Post' and one in the 'Los Angeles Times.'" Jaffe said Petrovskiy indicated the Secretary General of the UN was upset over the incident and Petrovskiy wonders if he should try to "pull the book back" (from publication), if it is still possible to do so.

Jaffe advised that the next day he visited the UN and talked to Petrovskiy and (FNU)"Loginov," who is (Soviet) Press Officer here (Washington, D.C.) and used to be Press Officer in Moscow. We had a conversation. He said he would be in Washington this week and would look me up. Loginov started to discuss the Chinese. I said I would like to go there. He said he had been in China and speaks Mandarin. He said he was very skeptical about one point in (United States President) Nixon's press conference, why he brought up Czechoslovakia in the press conference. 'Do you (Jaffe) think it was a slam at us (Soviets)?' He seemed to read a lot of stuff into it."

(Vadim Petrovich Loginov was in the United States October 27, 1959-November 25,1959 as a group leader and member of a Soviet delegation of students. He was again in the United States September 4,1967- November 29,1967 as a temporary trainee at the Soviet Embassy. He returned to the United States February 12, 1968 as First Secretary, Political Division, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.)

Identification of Soviet Nationals Employed in the Press Department, Soviet Foreign Ministry, Moscow

Jaffe was shown photographs of several Soviet nationals and he identified Leonid Mitrofanovich Zamyatin, Boris Dmitrievich Pyadyshev, and Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko as employees of the Press Department, Soviet Foreign Ministry, with whom he had contact while in Moscow. He was shown a photograph of Fedor Yakovlevich Semenov, but he did not recognize this individual and stated he was not identical with the Fedor Semenov he knew in Moscow as the Number Three Man in the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

Jaffe was asked if he observed any indication that any of these individuals were connected with Soviet Intelligence. Jaffe replied in the negative; however, he stated Boris Pyadyshev "is a very strange guy. A young man. Vladimir (Petrovskiy) told me he had risen to Number Two man (in the Press Department)." Jaffe recalled that on one occasion when he was accompanying N. K. Khrushchev on a trip, he invited Zamyatin to have a drink. Although Zamyatin ordinarily did not drink with Jaffe, he accepted his invitation on this occasion. Zamyatin indicated he was very tired of his position in the Press Department and planned to retire and write under a pseudonym. According to Jaffe, Mira Petrovskaya said she went to school with Pyadyshev. Jaffe said he found Pyadyshev to be a very bright, but very cold individual. Jaffe stated: "I have always felt that Mira Petrovskaya was connected with KGB;" however, she has never made any intelligence approach to Jaffe.

Jaffe then mentioned a Soviet national named Yuri Bekov (phonetic) and stated: "There is no question that he was KGB. (He was connected with) Press Department. He could do more things than the Press Department, but he was supposed to be an arm of the Press Department on trips. He knew all the overt KGB men."

(Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko has been reported as connected with the Soviet Committee of Information.)

## Identification of Soviet Nationals in Contact with Jaffe

Jaffe was then shown photographs of individuals, all but one identified by as ,KGB, and whom Jaffe identified on March 21, 1969 as Soviets with whom he had had contact either in the United States or in Russia. When making these identifications on March 21, 1969, Jaffe was not furnished the names of these individuals, and he indicated at that time that although he has a very good recollection of faces of individuals he has met, he has a very poor recollection of names. On April 29, 1969, Jaffe was shown the names as well as the photographs of these individuals, the names of whom are set forth hereinafter:

Jaffe indicated he did not recognize the names of any of these individuals except Vadim Biryukov, Yuriy Fedorov, and Mikhail Sagatelyan. He remarked that many of these individuals have rather common Russian names. He made the following additional remarks concerning individuals depicted in these photographs.

He said he is sure he met Evgeniy Gromakovskiy; however, this name is not familiar to him and he may have known him as Granovskiy. He continued: "I think I knew him, possibly at 'Tass. I don't think (I knew him) in Moscow." Jaffe stated he did not have close contact with this individual.

In regard to Vadim Biryukov, Jaffe stated: "I always thought that Vadim might have been with KGB. He got 'Life' into fantastic places. Then he worked for 'APN Novosti.' Now I understand he is no longer with 'APN.' He was really close to Ed Stevens."

When shown a photograph of Vladimir Krivoshey aka Krivitskiy, Jaffe stated: "He looks like a Russian. He looks familiar." Jaffe indicated he was sure whether or not he had contact with this individual and he does not recognize him by name.

In regard to Vyacheslav Kevorkov aka Chitashvili, Jaffe indicated he definitely knew this individual, but not under the name Kevorkov. He may have known him as Chitashvili, and recalled he was using the "cover of the secretary of the Union of Journalists."

In commenting on Yuriy Fedorov, Jaffe described him as "an evil S.O.B. Apparently an expert on China. 'Slava' (Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov aka Mislyuk, Kiselov, Kislov) said 'Fedorov is very upset with you (Jaffe), feels you don't like him. You never have him up to your home. You have other journalists (there).' I said I didn't like him. He said 'you should see him.' I just didn't. He just dropped out of sight."

Jaffe indicated he recognized the individual depicted in the photograph of Viktor Dmitriyevich Timofeyev as an individual with whom he had contact; however, this name is not familiar to him. He then stated he recalled an individual named Timofeyev (phonetic) who accompanied Khrushchev on a trip to the United States. Jaffe referred to this individual as a "mystery man" who was very close to Khrushchev. Jaffe indicated that this Timofeyev was not the individual depicted in the photograph of Viktor Dmitriyevich Timofeyev.

(On March 21, 1969 Jaffe identified a photograph of Timur Timofeevich Timofeev as a correspondent who "at one time stood very high in Soviet hierarchy" and "came here on Khrushchev trip." Jaffe was told '"he stood very high with Khrushchev and then some-thing happened.")

Jaffe was questioned specifically about Yevgeniy Nikolayevich Aleshin. He stated the name is not familiar to him but he recognizes the face and possibly he met him in the United States rather than in Moscow. He said he cannot recall that Aleshin gave any indication he was connected with KGB.

Jaffe again identified Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov as the Soviet national connected with KGB known to him first as "Slava" and later as Vyacheslav Kiselov. He did not associate the name Kuskov with "Slava".

Jaffe was questioned concerning previous comments he made that photographs of Nikolay Aleksandrovich Gavrilenko resemble "Slava's" KGB superior. Jaffe stated: "I can't say it (photographs of Gavrilenko) was 'Slava's' boss. He was less Russian looking. I definitely have seen this guy (Gavrilenko) but the name doesn't ring a bell."

When shown a photograph of Viktor Nikolaevich Titov, Jaffe commented: "This could be 'Slava's' boss." Jaffe said "Slava's" boss was a "fellow like this (Titov), younger than Slava.(I was) never introduced by name. All he ('Slava') said was, 'this is my boss.' He ('Slava's' boss) said he can speak a little English. 'Slava' said, 'Better let me translate.' All we did was go over the accident report. At the end he said, 'I am aware of the case.' Then they spoke in Russian. (Slava' asked) 'What do you think now that you have met Sam?' (The other Soviet replied) 'I would think there isn't anything to worry about.'" 'Slava" then indicated to Jaffe that if his boss said there was nothing to worry about, Jaffe could forget about the incident. Later "Slava" tore the accident report up in Jaffe's presence.

Jaffe again indicated he recognized photographs of Vladislav Mikhaylovich Kovshuk aka Vladimir Komarov, particularly the younger photograph; however, he does not recognize these names. He said he believes he had contact with this individual in the United States and not in Russia.

Jaffe stated his closest contacts among Soviet nationals in Moscow were:

Mikhail ("Mike") I. Bruk;
Yuriy Vladimirovich Fedorov;
Aleksandr "Sasha" Nezmanov, his translator;
Nikolai Sergeevich Kalinin;

Yuri Nikolaevich Vinogradov;

Lyudmila Borisovna (LNU), an artist who worked in the television section of APN.

Jaffe stated he also had several contacts with Oleg Danilovich Kalugin in Moscow; however, he did not associate as closely with Kalugin as he did with the aforementioned Soviets.

(Nikolai Sergeevich Kalinin has been reported as connected with KGB and with MVD.)

(Oleg Danilovich Kalugin has been reported as connected with KGB.)

Jaffe stated that another of his Soviet contacts, Vladimir Borisovich Barkovski, was definitely connected with KGB. Barkovski asked Jaffe to "write for their (Soviet) journalists because they don't know about the U.S." Jaffe said he mentioned Barkovski to "Slava," but "Slava" said he never heard of him. He also mentioned Kalinin to "Slava" and "Slava" denied knowing him. Jaffe said he believes Kalinin definitely was connected with KGB. He continued: "When I came to Moscow, who popped up of all people, but Nikolai Kalinin." Jaffe advised he once had his translator call Kalinin at a telephone number furnished by Kalinin; however, Kalinin was not known to the party answering the telephone.

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe said it was Lyudmila Borisovna (LNU) who confirmed the "Khrushchev ouster exclusive" given him by "Slava." Jaffe said he accomplished this through a telephone call to Lyudmila at APN. Prior to contacting Lyudmila, Jaffe had not been able to confirm the story.

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

United States Correspondents Currently in Moscow

Jaffe stated he recently received a letter requesting his advice from Irving Chapman who has been the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) correspondent in Moscow for only about three months. Jaffe said Ken Bernstein, who has been the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) correspondent in Moscow for three years, got an exclusive concerning the Chinese-Soviet border clash. Jaffe stated: "The pressure is on 'Irv' (Irving Chapman)!" who has been told, "if you can't do the job, you might as well get out."

In his letter, Chapman said, "I don't know how he got the film. I guess he got it through APN Novosti." Chapman reached the conclusion NBC apparently obtained the exclusive through Viktor Louis. Chapman stated: "I don't know how much NBC gives him, but he is riding around in a Porsche (automobile)." Jaffe then stated: "'Slava' was interesting, a Stalinist. Louis is a capitalist. I had very little to do with him. I was at his apartment once and I heard about his house." Jaffe indicated that because of his wife's curiosity, he and his wife visited the house of Viktor Louis, which he described as very "plush."

Jaffe said Chapman "asked me for my contacts and how he can defeat NBC." Chapman's letter stated: "I met many of your friends. They send best regards and inquire about you." Chapman mentioned three individuals, Vetler Prog (phonetic), who is connected with the State Committee on Radio and Television of the Soviet Foreign Ministry; Mikhail Bruk, and Viktor Louis. The letter stated: "They all indicate there has been no correspondent with ABC (in Russia) since Sam Jaffe left. They don't think much of Watkins (Jaffe's successor as ABC correspondent in Russia)." According to Jaffe, Chapman's letter indicated that Jaffe's Soviet contacts suggested that "if Jaffe was there he would have such an exclusive." Chapman asked: "Can you help me out and tell me what you can do with Louis?" Chapman's letter concluded: "If a KGB agent like Viktor Louis is good enough for S. Jaffe, he certainly is good enough for I. Chapman."

Jaffe said his advice to Chapman was: "Play one against the other, as well as with Viktor Louis, through the Embassy."

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 260

# SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Jaffe explained that he advised Chapman to clear all his contacts through the American Embassy, Moscow.

Jaffe indicated he was surprised when he learned recently that Viktor Louis had travelled to Taiwan and had written an article praising the Taiwan government.

Jaffe concluded: "Ken Bernstein should get out of there (Russia). He is a bachelor. I know he is shacking with Russian girls. I saw him in Hong Kong and asked, 'Are you going back.' He said he doesn't know exactly what he will do. (He said) 'I am going back for a while.'"

## Moscow Journalists Suspected by Jaffe of Being Connected With KGB

Jaffe was asked if he considered Edmund Stevens to be connected with KGB. He replied: "How can you stay in that country that long and get the things that he got without having some connection with KGB? How can he have this beautiful house? Then, when it is torn down (because of a roadbuilding project), he winds up in an ex-embassy!" In commenting on the Soviet wife of Stevens, Jaffe stated, "She is weerd. How does she get Soviet art out of the country?" Jaffe stated Stevens appears to have dropped out of the newspaper field. Jaffe said he was once a syndicated writer, but "not any more. He had a deal in caviar and vodka, selling vodka and caviar to the Kremlin." Jaffe described his daughter, Anastasia, as a "nut" and said he understands she is now married.

Jaffe emphatically expressed the opinion that Stevens, Viktor Louis and Henry Shapiro are connected with KGB. He described Shapiro as "an evil little man," "more Russian than the Russians." Jaffe stated: "He should get out and teach. He is no writer."

In discussing Viktor Louis, Jaffe stated he "never had any doubts that he (Louis) was with KGB." In discussing Louis, Jaffe indicated that all important "exclusives" in Moscow pertained to security matters and not to "leaks" from the Soviet Foreign Ministry concerning political matters; therefore, KGB must have been responsible for the "exclusives." Jaffe indicated that Louis was the recipient of many such "exclusives." Jaffe also indicated that Louis appears to live far better than other correspondents from foreign countries and is permitted to travel extensively abroad, including countries such as the United States and Taiwan. Jaffe indicated that these factors convince him that Louis is connected with KGB.

Jaffe concluded: "That is what they (KGB) do. They set this man up. If you want information," then contact a man such as Viktor Louis.

## Jaffe's Future Plans

Jaffe stated: "I like to keep contact with these people (Soviet and Chinese nationals) because it will pay off in the long run." Jaffe indicated he expects to attend the May Day celebration at the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. He also indicated he was still actively trying to obtain an assignment as a newspaper correspondent in Mainland China but has done nothing more concerning his desire to obtain a similar assignment in Cuba.

In discussing his desire to go to Mainland China, Jaffe indicated that he had interviewed Chou En Lai in 1955 and was one of 18 foreign correspondents selected to visit China in 1956. In the Fall of 1965 he went from Moscow to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, following his ouster from the Soviet Union, and conveyed to Chinese newsmen in Belgrade his desire to obtain a newspaper assignment in Mainland China. While in Hong Kong he made the same desire known to Szeto Kung of the Chinese News Agency. Finally, on April 28, 1969 he indicated to a Chinese professor at McGill University in Canada his desire to obtain a newspaper assignment in China and the professor agreed to forward a letter from Jaffe indicating

his desire to visit Mainland China, The Chinese professor has suggested that Jaffe mention in the letter that he desires to visit China as a private citizen rather than as a newspaper correspondent; however, Jaffe should be completely honest in the letter, mentioning the facts that he has been a journalist, that he interviewed Chou En Lai in 1955, and that when visiting China as a private citizen, he would like to continue his writing career.

of whom have been identified by informants as being connected with KGB or GRU. Characterizations of these Soviets have been included in the LHM; however, no attribution to sources was included in order to protect those sources who have not been surfaced. Although sources such as and and (5) who furnished information regarding Soviet Intelligence Service connections of some of JAFFE's contacts, have been surfaced, other sources such as and have furnished information regarding many of JAFFE's contacts. To attribute characterizations by of being connected with KGB of numerous Soviets and characterizations by of being connected with GRU of many other Soviet contacts of JAFFE, would clearly suggest that the FBI those establishments in the United States.

As indicated in reWFOlet 2/28/69 requesting Bureau authority for interview of subject, approved by Bulet 3/12/69, JAFFE was invited to UFO and showed no reluctance to do so. Since he was on general assignment, he called his office at the beginning of each of the first two interviews to give the. telephone number at which he could be located. He was contacted by his office during the first interview. On the third interview, he had what he called a "Bellboy" signalling device which he 'said would receive a signal from his office after which he would call. He indicated he used this device to avoid the office giving out the FBI telephone number to anyone, including Russians, who might call him.

JAFFE gave the appearance of being a very aggressive, U fast-talking, smooth operator. Prior to each interview, he had been drinking, but was not intoxicated.

The first two interviews were handled as planned, by asking him to recount his experiences and contacts with Russians S in the USSR and Hong Kong, including his experiences with "Slava". He expressed no hesitancy in talking about his contacts, but constantly spoke in generalities, tending to "playdown" his relations with "Slava". He furnished more detail after specific

WFO 105-8906

TX SECRET

or leading questions were put to him. For example, the disclosures he made to were confirmed in interview only after leading questions.

During the interview on 3/27/69, JAFFE was advised that interviewing agents were concerned regarding a number of aspects of his relationship with the Soviets and the FBI. For example, it was noted he had now disclosed considerable additional information about his relationship with "Slava", more than previously; that because of his past relationship with Agents of the NYO, the FBI had a right to expect that he would make immediate full disclosures of such relationship and his failure to do so raised questions about the relationship, whether he has been recontacted by KGB since he left Russia, etc. It also was pointed out that his expulsion from Russia after he had been ordered to Hong Kong and his replacement named, seemed somewhat suspicious, particularly since he had been warned that a defector knew of his relationship with "Slava"; that this defector had in fact reported this relationship and alleged that he had been an agent of and furnished information to "Slava". He was urged to now furnish complete information regarding his relationship with the KGB and to "square the record" with the FBI.

JAFFE did not lose his composure at any time during the interviews, but, as indicated in the LHM, when pressed on 3/27/69 on his relationship with KGB and his failure to make complete disclosure to FBI, he offered the lame excuse, his fear of "Slava", but conceded this was a poor excuse for not reporting the relationship after his return to the United States.

JAFFE was emphatically told that the FBI had not had any contact with the American Broadcast Company (ABC) with regard to him and had-not in any way labelled him as a security risk to any other person or agency. He replied that someone had done so and indicated he was aware that some ABC officials are very close to CIA.

WFO 105-8906

JAFFE seemed very concerned that ABC did not give him the diplomatic "beat" or the State Department "beat" which he seemed to consider his right. It appears he will continue contacts with the Soviet Bloc people as a means of trying to get such assignments. To preclude his use of cooperation with the_FBI as a means to this end, he was very emphatically told that the decision for such continued contacts was strictly his decision and the FBI would not ask him to do so.

It also is apparent that JAFFE is intensely interested in getting an assignment to China or Cuba. He denied that he had any KGB instructions to do so, but this, of course, is a definite possibility. It is not possible to accurately assess this possibility at this time, and it also is not possible to conclude whether he is or is not still in contact with KGB and acting as an agent. He emphatically denied any intelligence contact since he left Moscow; however, the call which he said he received from BORIS SEDOV desiring to show him a photograph seems unusual and is possibly contrived.

JAFFE is in current contact with Chinese nationals, which he is reporting to  , who appears to be very friendly with JAFFE and, of course, is interested in getting him into China.

WFO 105-8906

Since the interview of 3/27/69, JAFFE has telephonically furnished some general information regarding his current contacts with Soviet and Satellite nationals and his unsuccessful efforts to recontact SEDOV.

Based on the interviews, WFO believes that we should continue to accept information volunteered by JAFFE regarding his contacts with Soviets, Satellites, and Chinese; however, it is believed no effort should be made at this time to direct his activities or to give him assignments, particularly since the possibility exists he would attempt to use any such relationship to support his attempts to get certain assignments from ABC, or otherwise advance his career. WFO will follow this policy,

In the event JAFFE later reports that he has been recontacted by KGB to work in the United States, this matter will be re-evaluated and appropriate recommendations made.

WFO will keep this file in a Pending status for a limited time to follow JAFFE's relationship with SEDOV and to see if this develops into a KGB follow-up. If it does not, the case will be closed.

## I. Jaffe's Contacts with FBI, 1958-1961

Samuel Adason Jaffe, born June 19, 1929, San Francisco, California, advised agents of the New York Office, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in July, 1958, that he was taking two Soviet employees of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations (SMUN) to dinner. At that time Jaffe was a Columbia Broadcast System (CBS) News Correspondent at the United Nations (UN). Jaffe subsequently furnished voluminous information concerning his contacts with Soviet nationals to the FBI from 1958 until November, 1961 when he assumed the position of American Broadcast Company (ABC) Television Correspondent in Moscow.

## II. Jaffe's Contacts with FBI While Assigned to Moscow

Jaffe furnished the following information to agents of the New York Office of the FBI on January 7, 1963.

Jaffe stated he was acquainted with Yuri Vladimirovich Fedorov while in Moscow. Jaffe said Fedorov was with the Novosti Press Agency in Moscow.

While Jaffe was in Moscow, in 1962, he became acquainted with a number of Soviet citizens both male and female. He said that he was dating one Soviet female by the name of Galina in the Fall of 1962. He became acquainted with her through other Soviet females with whom he was acquainted; however, he was unable to furnish her last name. Galina told Jaffe that she had been dating foreigners in the past and, because of this, had been called into KGB Headquarters and warned against continuing her association with foreigners.

During the Cuban crisis, in the Fall of 1962, Fedorov told Jaffe confidentially that there was a bitter dispute among the Soviet hierarchy in the Kremlin concerning the manner in which the Soviets should deal with the Cuban crisis. Fedorov told Jaffe that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev was able to muster enough support for his position and eventually won out over those in the Soviet hierarchy who proposed a tough uncompromising attitude.

Jaffe advised that he used the information furnished to him by Yuri V. Fedorov concerning the dispute in the Kremlin over the Cuban crisis in a broadcast over the ABC network.

Jaffe recalled that the aforementioned information came to him from Fedorov on a Friday late in October, 1962. On the following day, a Saturday, Jaffe attended a social function at the home of Stanley Weyman, Life Magazine correspondent in Moscow. He brought his friend, Galina, with him and remained at Weyman's house until some time after midnight. When he departed from Weyman's house, he took Galina and a Soviet male with him. The Soviet male, whose name he could not remember, was also a guest at Weyman's house and Jaffe offered to drive him home. This Soviet male was associated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to Jaffe.

After Jaffe dropped the Soviet male at his home, he proceeded to drive toward Galina's home. At Galina's instruction, he made a turn in an area of Moscow which was unfamiliar to him. After making this turn he hit a deep hole and blew out several tires on the Chevrolet automobile which he was driving. Jaffe said that he sent Galina to obtain police assistance and, after she left, he noticed four male individuals driving by in an old Pobeda automobile. Shortly thereafter several truck drivers came by and assisted Jaffe. Fortunately, he had several spare tires in his automobile. At about 3:15 a.m., the police came by but showed no interest in Jaffe and apparently made no report of his situation. Jaffe then returned to his apartment.

Some time after Jaffe returned to his apartment, he received a telephone call from Galina. Galina told Jaffe that she had to see him immediately. She said that she was near the American Embassy in Moscow and Jaffe arranged to meet her in the vicinity of the Ukraine Hotel in Moscow.

When Jaffe met Galina he found that she had apparently been physically abused as she bore scars and marks on her arms and face. Galina told Jaffe that after she left him she went to telephone for assistance. As she was leaving the telephone from which she made the call to the police, she was accosted by two men. She immediately resisted efforts of these men to detain her and as she ran from them she was accosted by another man who knocked her to the ground. She told Jaffe that she was then taken to a police station where she was questioned at length about her association with Jaffe. The individuals questioning her wanted to know how long she had been seeing Jaffe, where she had been with Jaffe and they were particularly interested in her travels with Jaffe during the last several days. They wanted to know if Jaffe was in love with her.

Galina told Jaffe that they wanted her to sign a statement to the effect that she would not see Jaffe again. These individuals also wanted to know what, if anything, Jaffe had given her by way of gifts.

Galina told Jaffe that at approximately 6:00 a.m. another individual came in and questioned her about the same matters but did so in a very polite and refined manner. This was in contrast to the manner in which she had been questioned immediately subsequent to her arrival at the police station. Galina told Jaffe that she was quite upset and a doctor was also called to administer a sedative to her.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 277

# SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Before being released by the police, Galina was told by the police not to see Jaffe again. She said that they told her that Jaffe's name and her name would appear in "Izvestia".

After hearing Galina's story, Jaffe called Fedorov and relayed the story of Galina's experiences to Fedorov. Fedorov told Jaffe that he would be right over to see him.

According to Jaffe, Fedorov immediately came to see him at his apartment. Upon his arrival Fedorov acted as though he were shocked by the whole story which Jaffe told to him. Fedorov told Jaffe that this was a very serious matter and that an article was then being written concerning Jaffe's association with Galina. He said that Jaffe would be depicted as an American who had led a Soviet female astray. This would serve as a Esson to Soviet citizens, particularly females, to refrain from associating with American citizens. Fedorov also told Jaffe that this article would appear in "Komsomolskaya Pravda". Fedorov said that he did not know what he could possibly do for Jaffe but suggested that a friend of his, who is a Deputy Editor with "Komsomolskaya Pravda", might be able to help. Fedorov suggested that there might still be time to stop the story. In Jaffe's presence Fedorov made a telephone call allegedly to his friend the Deputy Editor. After the call was made Fedorov told Jaffe that it would be okay for them to see his friend at 6:00 p.m. that night.

Jaffe met Fedorov at a restaurant in Moscow at 6:00 p.m. that evening in accordance with arrangements previously made. Fedorov's friend, the Deputy Editor, was to meet them there but prior to Fedorov's friend's arrival, Fedorov told Jaffe that his friend was not actually Deputy Editor of "Komsomol-skaya Pravda". He told Jaffe that his friend was an old war buddy who just happened to be in the KGB.

When Fedorov's friend arrived he was introduced to Jaffe as Vyacheslav Kislov. Jaffe came to know this individual as "Slava". Kislov said to Jaffe "I guess you know who I am". He then went on to tell Jaffe that he was with the KGB. He said that he and his colleagues were not too pleased with Jaffe's conduct. He asked Jaffe who his source in the Kremlin was and then


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 278

SECRET

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

suggested that information which Jaffe obtained concerning a dispute in the Kremlin came from someone in the American Embassy in Moscow. Jaffe denied that his source was in the American Embassy in Moscow but refused to tell Kislov the identity of his source.

Kislov then proceeded to give Jaffe a complete run down of everything he had done in Russia. He named females Jaffe had dated and told Jaffe all about his association with Galina. He went on to tell Jaffe that Galina was formerly a designer in a factory in Moscow but that she would be given a trial and be banned from Moscow.

When Jaffe asked Kislov about the story being prepared for "Komsomolskaya Pravda", Kislov told Jaffe that he liked him. He said that he might be able to kill the story while at the same time he looked at his watch. He then said that he would see what he could do, expressing the opinion that he could probably kill the story. Before Jaffe left Kislov's company, Kislov said that he would like to see Jaffe again and Jaffe agreed to see him although no definite arrangements were made.

On the following morning Kislov called Jaffe and told Jaffe that he had succeeded in killing the story. He asked Jaffe to have lunch with him and a date was made. At lunch Kislov told Jaffe that he had been in the United States. He then told Jaffe that it was necessary to watch Western cor- respondents in Moscow as the Soviets know that American citizens pay a great deal of attention to material written in newspapers. He said it was necessary for the Soviets to be careful what they permit Western correspondents to write and say. He said the Soviets would like to know Western reaction to Soviet moves particularly Soviet moves in situations like the Cuban crisis.

Kislov then went on to tell Jaffe that he was lucky to be in Moscow and it was only because of his superiors that he was granted a visa. He told Jaffe that Jaffe killed his chances for obtaining a Soviet visa of his own accord because of his conduct during the trial of Francis Gary Powers on espionage charges in Moscow in 1960. At this time Kislov said that the Soviets concluded that Jaffe was employed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and had been assigned to keep track of Powers' wife, Barbara, since he spent so much time in her company.

Jaffe was aware that upon his arrival in Moscow late in 1961, he was kept under surveillance for four solid weeks. Kislov called this to Jaffe's attention and told Jaffe that he had aggravated some Soviets who were surveilling him because of his activities. Kislov then went on to discuss the fact that the Soviets had exposed several United States Embassy officials as intelligence agents recently. Kislov told Jaffe that these were strictly retaliatory measures taken by the Soviets because of Soviet nationals associated with the United Nations who had been exposed in the United States.

Kislov also asked Jaffe to bring him a miniphone recording machine from the United States.

Jaffe said that during his stay in Moscow he has never experienced anything which would indicate that the Soviets were attempting to compromise him with the exception of the one incident related herein.

Jaffe made one observation stemming from his visit in Moscow to the effect that the younger generation Soviet is more free thinking and independent than his elders. The younger generation Soviets, in Jaffe's opinion, do not have the unbending fear of the Soviet regime which has been characteristic of the Soviet people in the past.

Yuri Vladimirovich Fedorov was in the United States from January 20, 1962 until May 1, 1962, with the visit of the Soviet Children's Art Exhibit to the United States, He is a Senior Editor of the periodical "East and Latin America" of the Novosti Press Agency.

Jaffe was able to identify a photograph of Fedorov as the individual known to him in Russia.

The Novosti Press Agency was newly established in Russia in February, 1961.

"Komsomolskaya Pravda" is the Communist Party (CP) youth edition of "Pravda".

"Pravda" is the organ of the Central and Moscow Committees of the CP of the Soviet Union. It is a central newspaper published in Moscow.

"Izvestia" is the news organ of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

Jaffe stated he was very displeased with his assignment in Moscow because of living conditions. He intended to fulfill his contract which called for his return to the U.S. in November, 1963. Jaffe did not intend to renew his contract as far as an assignment in Moscow is concerned.

Jaffe made his home in Moscow at 19 Kutuzovsky Prospect, Apartment 133-134, Entrance 4, Floor 6, Moscow.

During the year he had been assigned to Moscow, Jaffe traveled to Copenhagen, Italy, Finland, and Rumania. All of these trips were on business with the exception of his trip to Italy where he spent his vacation. Jaffe advised on January 7, '1963, that while in Moscow he had occasion to see the following Soviet nationals with whom he was acquainted in the United States:

Evgeni V. Litoshko
Danil Kraminov
Aleksei I. Adzhubei
Nikolai S. Kalinin

during the week of December 30, 1962. Jaffe was with Dave Miller," New York Herald Tribune" Moscow correspondent, at that time. Jaffe said that he and Miller spent about an hour with Bogachev and Turkatenko discussing life in Moscow.

Jaffe left the U.S. on January 13, 1963 for East Berlin, where he was to cover the visit of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to that city. He then would return to Moscow with Khrushchev and complete his assignment there.

During interview of January 7, 1963, Jaffe asked if there was any way that he could possibly communicate information to interviewing agents. He explained that he does not expect to come into possession of any earth shattering or startling information, but he does believe that it would be possible for him to learn of information which would be of interest to the FBI from time to time. He had specific reference to advance notice which he might receive of information which might later become public knowledge through news media. Jaffe was discouraged from attempting to communicate with FBI agents in any manner whatsoever from Moscow.

Jaffe said that he is not favorably impressed with State Department representatives in Moscow, at least the ones with whom he deals. He said that the people with whom he deals give him the impression of being naive in the field of security and intelligence work, and therefore, he has no desire whatsoever to furnish information to them. Jaffe had particular reference to the security officers in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow with whom he has dealt.

Jaffe said that he does know one individual by the name of Sam Wise at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in whom he has the utmost confidence.

Jaffe advised agents of the New York Office of the FBI on January 18, 1965, that since he had been assigned to Moscow he has become very friendly with Yuri M. Vinogradov, who is presently assigned to the United Nations Secretariat.. He advised that Vinogradov's wife is a top rated television star in Moscow on children's programs. On Monday, January 18, 1965, Jaffe had lunch with Vinogradov and his wife and James Hagerty, an official of the ABC. Conversation during this lunch

concerned itself with Vinogradov's wife's interest in making television shows in the U.S. for presentation in Russia. Jaffe said that Vinogradov's wife has been here for a very short time with her child and she is very upset about being in the U.S. and does not like it one bit. This in turn has upset Vinogradov and Vinogradov's wife's mother, who still resides in their two room apartment in Russia, is also very upset over the presence of her daughter and grandchild in the U.S. Jaffe said that Vinogradov's wife's mother lives with the family in this two room apartment in Moscow and by Soviet standards they live rather well.

Jaffe said that Vinogradov has good taste and is interested in the finer things in life and seldom fails to ask Jaffe to obtain a bottle of Scotch for him when he sees him in life.

Jaffe said that Vinogradov does like the good things.

He said that on Saturday evening, January 16, 1965, he visited Aleksandr N. Druzhinin in his apartment in the Schwab House for dinner. Druzhinin's son and wife were present as well as Stanislav N. Kondrashov and Georgi A Kuznetsov. Jaffe said this was-strictly a social visit related to his assignment in Moscow and acquaintance with many Soviet nationals.

Jaffe said that he has seen Vadim A Bogoslovski in the Soviet Union, however, of recent date Bogoslovski no longer acknowledges his acquaintance with Jaffe. Jaffe spoke to Vinogradov about this and Vinogradov told Jaffe that Bogoslovski is a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and as such is forced to give up many of his former friends and acquaintances. Vinogradov said that as much as he likes Jaffe, he would give up his acquaintance with Jaffe were he to be elevated to a sensitive position on the Central Committee.

Jaffe advised that Nikolai Kalinin, with whom he has been acquainted in the past, is now assigned to the Soviet Embassy in Vienna, Austria.

Jaffe said that he is acquainted with a Frank Dandridge, a Negro photographer. He met this individual through Mari Yanopsky, who is employed in the Publicity Department of ABC. Yanopsky introduced Dandridge to Jaffe for the purpose of soliciting Jaffe's cooperation in arranging a trip to the Soviet Union for Dandridge. Jaffe said he was never able to do anything for Dandridge.

WF T-1, advised that on January 16, 1964,
Frank Dandridge, a Negro photographer,
told Oleg M. Sokolov he was referred to
Sokolov by Sam Jaffe. He said he is
planning a trip to Russia in March,
1964, with a Negro writer. They plan to
do an article on Negros who have resided
in Russia for 20 to 30 years. They are
interested in facilities for Negros in
the Caucases. Dandridge indicated he
obtained information on this matter from
the offices of "The Worker." Dandridge
also indicated he would like to interview
N. K. Khrushchev. Sokolov advised Dandridge
to write a letter, with full details of
his proposed trip, to Aleksandr I. Zinchuk.

"The Worker" is an east-coast Communist
newspaper.

Jaffe advised that since former Soviet Premier
Nikita Khrushchev was deposed there has been a very noticeable
effort to change the image of the KGB in the Soviet Union
through television programs, newspaper and magazine stories and
the like. These television programs and newspaper and magazine
stories resemble television programs, newspaper and magazine
stories which might be read or seen in the U.S. and be classed
as detective stories. They are designed to create a favorable
impression upon the Soviet populace concerning the KGB as well
as solicit the cooperation of the Soviet populace in combatting
subversion on the part of foreign visitors as well as combat-
ting crime. The Soviet populace is urged to report suspicious
activity in both of these fields to the KGB. KGB personnel are
depicted as competent, efficient, and friendly officials with
whom the Soviet populace can readily.do business.

Jaffe has also noticed that Vladimir/Semichastnyy,
KGB_Chief_and member of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party, has taken a more prominent place among Soviet officials
at public functions than he formerly did and he can also be
seen at diplomatic affairs circulating more freely than he would
formerly circulate under the Khrushchev regime.

## III. Allegations of WF T-2 Concerning Jaffe

WF T-2, a former officer of the Soviet Committee of State Security (IGB), advised in , that Sam Jaffe, ABC correspondent in Moscow, is a recruited agent of KGB. He was cultivated and recruited by Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov, a case officer of the 1st (American) Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB. WF T-2 indicated KGB probably would use Jaffe to introduce individuals connected with KGB to interesting targets and to obtain political information.

-On report concerning Jaffe, stating that Sam Jaffe, an American correspondent, arrived in Moscow in 1961. Vladislav Mikhailovich Kovshuk also known as (aka) Vladimir Mikhailovich/Komarov, Chief of the 1st (American Embassy) Section, 1st Department, SCD, KGB, settled a question with the 10th Department (operations against foreign correspondents), SCD, that the 1st Department would be working against Jaffe. WF T-2 recalled that Jaffe was acquainted with a ballet dancer from Finland who was finishing her studies in Moscow. Jaffe was actually thinking about marrying this girl.

According to WF T-2, the Finnish ballet dancer could speak English and visited the American House Club.

In WF T-2 Gennadiy Ivanovich Gryaznov aka Grigoriy Ivanovich Lapin, Deputy Kovshuk and Chief of the 1st Section, 1st Department, SCD, KGB, that Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov, a senior case officer of the Ist Section, was working against Jaffe, WF T-2 wrote: "I don't know (whether) he was anagent or an operative contact. I am not sured but it seems to me that he was approached on the basis (of being) connected with women. In I have seen Sam Jaffee in . He with other correspondents visited a pair of times the Soviet representation there. He knew several Russian diplomats and among them (that he knew was) Suslov, Vladimir."

# SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

During interview on concerning his handwritten report, WF T-2 furnished substantially the same information. He stated he did not know whether Jaffe was a KGB agent or operative contact; however, he knew Kuskov was meeting with Jaffe and had obtained some information from him. WF T-2 indicated that Kuskov obtained an agreement with the 10th Department at the 1st Department would work against Jaffe in order to have an agent who could move in American Embassy circles in Moscow. WF T-2 said he thought Kovshuk had contact with Jaffe, probably posing as a diplomat and using the name Komarov. The informant does not know whether or not Gryaznov knew Jaffe.

WF T-2 was asked why he was sure Jaffe was actually a KGB agent or operative contact. He replied: "In when we (KGB) were planning to work against a group of businessmen - very big businessmen - there was plan of work and there were different, different, one, two, three questions (of) which agents to use - not only 7th Department, but 10th Department, 1st Department - and there were put agents - to use the agents against this group - and 1st Department - Jaffe's name was there, and Kuskov was coming and giving information which he had received" from Jaffe.

WF T-2 recalled there was another case involving a visiting group in which KGB plans called for the use of Jaffe. WF T-2, who in , but who formerly had worked with in the , telephoned and asked: "How about ) reciving information from your agents on whom you can rely - you must help us." WF T-2 said ordered Kuskov to use Jaffe against this group. WF T-2 stated: "I know they were received by Khrushchev and (it is) highly demanded in KGB everytime when Khrushchev was receiving anybody to know after that - what was said (by the individuals visiting Khrushchev)."

WF T-2 advised that probably in 1963 Kuskov was appointed Chief of the 2nd Section (operations against individuals suspected of being with American Intelligence and use of double agents against American Intelligence), 1st Department, SCD; however, "Kuskov still kept Jaffe as an agent or contact."

On , WF T-2 advised that the visits to Russia of the two American groups about which Jaffe reported information to Kuskov occurred in and one involved a group of Congressmen who signed a treaty connected with limitations of nuclear explosions in the air and the other involved a "group of big businessmen" sponsored by "Time" magazine. WF T-2 said he recalls the businessmen group was sponsored by "Time" "because one of the managers of this 'Time' was coming, and a group of correspondents was accompanying them from - I think London, from Paris, maybe from Bonn." WF T-2 indicated that both groups met with Khrushchev and Jaffe reported to Kuskov "their opinions, their attitude." WF T-2 is of the opinion that Jaffe furnished his information orally to Kuskov who then prepared written reports. When questioned concerning the type of information Jaffe furnished, WF T-2 stated: "Oh, it's general their opinion on something. Nothing important. Nothing from the point of intelligence - counterintelligence, in the meaning that he had_given something only about special person, no, no, nothing. In general - their opinion and their attitude."

WF T-2 was advised that Jaffe was expelled from Russia. in the Fall of 1965 because of a critical story prepared by. ABC but not by Jaffe. WF T-2 then commented: "I think my personal opinion - that he couldn't be expelled. It could be a cover.for Jaffe. They wanted to cover him, knowing the fact that I knew about his connection. I think it's possite for the sake of cover."

WF T-2 was not aware of Jaffe covering the Francis Gary Powers trial and he was not aware of any "exclusives" furnished to Jaffe by the KGB. WF T-2 was not aware of any KGB officers from the 1st Department, with the exception of Kuskov and possibly Kovshuk who met Jaffe. WF T-2 stated: "I think maybe Kovshuk in 1962, beginning in 1963, could visit - meet him, but at the same time I doubt, because Kovshuk was playing the part of diplomat of Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He knew him in face, and I think Jaffe knew him (Kovshuk) in face - as Komarov."

WF T-2 was asked if he had ever heard that Jaffe was in contact with KGB officers in the United States prior to Jaffe's Moscow assignment. WF T-2 answered in the negative and

stated: "But he was known to many diplomats - maybe some officers of KGB even - I don't know - on official base"(in / connection with his activities as a foreign correspondent).
WF T-2 continued: "Of course officers from 10th Department, from this section which was working against correspondents, knew him: Krivoshei (Vladimir Vasilyevich Krivoshei aka Krivitsky) and others could know him. He probably knew Krivoshei as Krivitsky - correspondent Krivitsky - because they were appearing" as offical contacts.

WF T-2 stated Jaffe was approached by KGB in the second half of 1962, possibly at the end of 1962.

On some WF T-2 was shown a newspaper clipping concerning the "Time" magazine businessmen group which visited Russia in . He stated this was one of the visiting American groups about which Jaffe furnished informa- tion to KGB.

IV. Allegations of WF T-3 Concerning Jaffe

WF T-3 advised that the American correspondent, Sam Jaffe, was approached by the KGB in Moscow but does not know the details concerning this approach. WF T-3 stated he did not know if the KGB had been successful in recruiting Jaffe but believed the attempt failed. He reported that Yevgeniy N. Aleshin commented that when Jaffe was in Moscow he personally controlled all of Jaffe's actions and knew all the details concerning Jaffe's activities. Aleshin also commented that he regarded Sam Jaffe as a hoax.

WF T-2 identified Aleshin by name and photograph and advised that until 1952 he was involved in Communist Party - Komsomol work; from 1952 - 1960 served in the 1st Department, SCD, KGB; and since 1960 or 1961 was Chief of 10th Department, SCD, KGB. While in the Ist Department he served in the 2nd and 3rd Sections; at one time was chief of the section dealing with Russians suspected of having connections with United States Intelligence, and from about 1959 - 1960 was Deputy Chief of the 1st Department.

V. Jaffe's Contacts with FBI Subsequent to
Expulsion From Moscow, October, 1965

On December 2, 1965, Jaffe advised agents of
the New York Office of the FBI that he was notified of his
expulsin from Russia in October, 1965, by Leonid Zamyatin,
number one man in the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign
Ministry. During his stay in Moscow he had contact with
Zamyatin and Boris Pyadyshev, number two man in the Press
Department; Fedor Semenov, number three man in the Press
Department; Fedor/Fedorenko, number four man in the Press
Department; and Anatoli Kachev, number five man in the Press
Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry. All of these
people were friendly to Jaffe and somewhat apologetic con-
cerning the fact that he was being expelled from the Soviet
Union. This was particularly true of Kachev, who told Jaffe
that he hoped to be able to see him in New York City sometime
in the future.

Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko has been
reported as connected with the
Soviet Committee of Information (KI).

Leonid Mitrofanovich Zamyatin has been
reported as connected with the
Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD).

According to Jaffe, Kachev also told him not to
be concerned about his expulsion and that, if there were any-
thing the Soviets could do for Jaffe, Oleg Kalugin was in
Washington, D.C. Jaffe said he is acquainted with Kalugin and
knew Kalugin when he was the number three man in the Press Depart-
ment of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, after Kalugin's return to
Russia from his previous assignment in New York City and prior
to his present assignment at the Soviet Embassy in Washington,
D.C. Prior to his present assignment in Washington, D.C.,
Kalugin transferred from the Press Department of the Soviet
Foreign Ministry to Radio Moscow in the American Department.
Jaffe said Kalugin is very Americanized in his outlook and
Jaffe knows Kalugin to be a very talkative individual.

Jaffe also advised on December 2, 1965, that he knows *Vadim Evgenievich Golovanov*, an exchange student studying at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. Kalugin and Golovanov are acquainted with each other because of their journalistic backgrounds and assignments in the journalism field in Russia. Jaffe said Golovanov formerly was a Radio Moscow correspondent usually assigned to interview prominent American citizens visiting Russia.

During interview of December 2, 1965, Jaffe also furnished information on several other Soviet nationals. He said he had seen *Vladimir P Suslov* briefly in Moscow since Suslov returned to Russia, and Jaffe indicated Suslov is now Andrei Gromyko's chief advisor. Jaffe stated Vladimir F. Petrovskiy and his wife, Mira, also were employed in Gromyko's office when they were in Russia. According to Jaffe, Petrovskiy and his wife attended Jaffe's reception at the American Embassy, Moscow following his marriage two and a half years ago.

Jaffe Said *Yuri Vinogradov*, who was formerly employed on the Staff of the United Nations Secretariat, was a good friend of his and was one of three individuals who stood up for him at the time of his marriage in Russia. The other two were Stewart Ramsey of McGraw-Hill, Incorporated, and Martin Paige, of the "London Daily Express." Since Vinogradov returned to Russia in February, 1965, he has been inaccessible to Jaffe. Vinogradov is assigned to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow and Jaffe has heard that while in the United States, Vinogradov was running around with an Indian girl who was the wife of U-Thant's Military Advisor. Jaffe said this allegedly is the reason Vinogradov was recalled to Russia.

Jaffe said Igor Chechetkin is now in charge of the United Nations Information Bureau in Moscow. Jaffe said he has not seen Vladimir I. Bogachev, since his return to the United States, although he is well acquainted with Bogachev. Jaffe said Vadim Bogoslovski is employed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in a position in which he is supposed to have no contact with foreigners.

Jaffe also advised he became acquainted with Andrei N. Itskov when Itskov was the number three man in the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow. Jaffe recalled Itskov did not like his assignment and was eventually transfered to "Izvestia" prior to his assignment in Washington, D.C.

Jaffe said he became acquainted with Oleg M. Sokolov in Washington, D.C., in connection with his occupation as a television news correspondent. Jaffe said he was in contact with Sokolov and Itskov in January, 1964, in connection with his assignment as ABC correspondent in Moscow and the contact was a matter of maintaining his contacts among Soviet nationals for professional reasons. He was unable to recall specific matters of conversation during his 1964 contact.

(WF T-l advised on January 22, 1964, that he learned from Oleg M. Sokolov, Attache, Press Department, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C., that Sokolov had been contacted on that date by Sam Jaffe, who had just arrived in Washington, D.C., and planned to stay there until January 24, 1964. Jaffe wanted to get together for a drink with Sokolov and agreed to meet him that evening. Jaffe suggested that Sokolov invite Andrei Nikolaevich Itskov, "Izvestia" correspondent at Washington, D.C., to join them and Jaffe would bring another person. According to WF T-1, Jaffe seemed to know Itskov very well and said he had given Itskov the names of a couple of persons to look_up when Itskov came to Washington, D.C.)

On September 13, 1968, Jaffe advised agents of the New York Office of the FBI that he was recalled from his assignment as correspondent for ABC in Hong Kong and would be reassigned as a general correspondent in either New York or Washington, D.C. He advised that while in Hong Kong he associated with both Russian and Chinese individuals. He said he also was acquainted with the FBI and CIA representative in Hong Kong.

He stated he and his wife visited the Soviet ship "Bikal" on four or five occasions while it was in Hong Kong and they entertained two Russian engineers, E. Gouriev and Pavel Dmitriev on one occasion in their home after having met them aboard the Russian ship.

Jaffe also advised that he and Brian Slevin, Chief of the Special Branch, Hong Kong Police, never saw eye-to-eye. He said Ted Savan of British Intelligence, Special Branch, Hong Kong mentioned to Jaffe that Jaffe was being recalled by ABC for security reasons. Jaffe indicated he was unable to understand why ABC had recalled him from Hong Kong.

On September 17, 1968, Jaffe advised he probably would be assigned to Washington, D.C., and would depart for Washington the latter part of the week. He said that while in Washington, D.C., during the week of September 9, 1968, he contacted Oleg Kalugin and Vladimir Bogachev.

On November 14, 1968, Jaffe approached some agents of the Washington Field Office who were conducting a surveillance in the area of his residence (but not on Jaffe) and indicated he would like to have contact with the FBI in Washington, D.C., in the same manner as he had previously had contact in New York. He indicated he was in contact with Soviets in Washington, D.C., and would report on them.

On February 5, 1969, Jaffe telephonically contacted an agent of the New York Office and advised that ABC was in receipt of two copies of a book entitled "America's Unelected Rulers of the Council of Foreign Relations", written by Phoebe Greene, Courtney of New Orleans, Lousiana. According to Jaffe, this book lists a number of people who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations who have subversive backgrounds. Jaffe is one of the individuals listed in this book. According to Jaffe, another section accuses Jaffe of being a member of the American League for Peace and Democracy. Jaffe indicated he is quite incensed over the information contained in this book concerning him and he connected the information in the book with his recent recall from Hong Kong by ABC. Jaffe said he has never been a member of the American League for Peace and Democracy; however, he has been a member for many years of the Council on Foreign Relations. Jaffe said he understands that Courtney and her husband reside in New Orleans and are considered to be erratic individuals in the area of anti-Communist activity.

WF T-4, advised that on January 16, 1966, Sam Jaffe contacted Oleg D. Kalugin and indicated he had been trying to get in touch with Kalugin for two days. He said he was in Washington, D.C., in connection with a breakfast with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, but that Rusk's assistant, George Ball, was substituting for him. Jaffe indicated he would return to New York and then to California. Jaffe suggested that he and Kalugin have lunch together, and asked Kalugin how the prospects looked for ABC to again get representation in Russia. Kalugin suggested that they discuss the matter at lunch.

WF T-1 advised that on October 7, 1968, Kalugin contacted Jaffe in response to aprior request by Jaffe, Jaffe told Kalugin he returned from Moscow and is now assigned to Washington, D.C. They agreed to get together for lunch on October 8, 1968.

VII. FBI Interviews of Jaffe in March, 1969

At the request of a Special Agent, Jaffe voluntarily appeared for interviews at the Washington Field Office of the FBI on March 20, 21, and 27, 1969.

March 20, 1969

At the inception of the interview on March 20, 1969, Jaffe was advised that it was realized he had been in contact with FBI Agents in New York since 1958, and had furnished information concerning his contacts with Soviet nationals. He was advised that interviewing agents were interested in his contacts with Soviet nationals in Russia and in the United States, and since he had not been fully debriefed concerning his tours of duty in Moscow and Hong Kong, interviewing agents desired to obtain his comments concerning these assignments including his comments concerning his relationship with "Slava" in Moscow, which he previously reported to the FBI in 1963. His comments concerning contacts with Soviets since his return from Hong Kong were also solicited.

Association with KGB Contact "Slava"
(Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov, aka
Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Mislyuk,-
Vyacheslav Kiselov, Vyacheslav Kislov)

Jaffe was requested to recount the circumstances
under which he met "Slava." He stated he met "Slava" through
Yuri Fedorov, an employee of Novosti Press Agency (APN).
Initially Jaffe was led to believe "Slava" also was connected
with APN, but later he learned "Slava" was connected with KGB.

Jaffe continued: "What specifically he ('Slava')
did, I don't know, but he was contacting foreigners. He was
interested in what went on at American Embassy briefings. I
would string him along. I would meet him usually at a restau-
rant. He was a real hawk, a real Stalinist Khrushchev was
wrong, China was right real old-guard Stalinist. Whenever
there was anything of any importance regarding Soviet-American
relations he would ask, 'what did they say at the briefings?'"

Jaffe indicated he told "Slava" he did not learn
anything important at the briefings. Jaffe continued: "This
was basically the relationship. The only thing he asked me
for was 'What is the thinking at the Embassy? What did the
Ambassador have to say at the briefing?' I got the impression
he had other sources because he would say, 'This isn't what I
understand.'"

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe said he
would see "Slava" on the average of once every two or two and
one half weeks. He continued: "I have met his wife. She was
formerly KGB." Jaffe indicated he learned from "Slava" that
his wife had been with KGB and was retired.

Jaffe indicated he subsequently met "Slava's"
boss following an automobile accident in which he hit a
pedestrian in Moscow., He had had a couple of drinks, and was
driving an employee to the airport when a Russian male sud-
denly appeared "weaving in front of my car. I hit the guy. I
thought he was dead. I got out of the car. He was unconscious."
Jaffe indicated the police appeared as did a "Mobile Lab" and a
crowd of people. Jaffe gave a statement and was told everything
was all right; however, it was necessary for him to go to the

police station. At the station, Jaffe initially was led to believe there was no problem, until an assistant traffic chief of police appeared. "This man spotted me" and he was required to take a sobriety test. Jaffe stated he passed the test although there was a trace of alcohol in his system. Jaffe was permitted to leave, but later was required to return to the police station and "they said it was decided to press charges."

Jaffe said he reported the matter to the American Embassy and received conflicting advice. "Some said shut up because if you push them" it might lead to serious trouble. "Others said scream like hell because they have never convicted an American correspondent." Jaffe decided "to take the dovish" position.

Jaffe continued: "At this point 'Slava' found out about it. He came to see me and said it was very, very serious." A little later, Jaffe and his wife had prepared to leave on vacation but at the last minute he was told he could not obtain an exit visa until the automobile accident had been cleared up. Jaffe then got a call from "Slava" who "Said he would like me to meet a guy. This man - I think I could identify - very young, very tough, aggressive guy, good looking, in 30's. 'Slava' said it was his chief and he just wanted to meet me." Initially the conversation was quite general, with "Slava's" boss, who spoke very good English, asking Jaffe his thoughts about the Soviet Union. Toward the end of the meeting, "Slava" mentioned Jaffe's automobile accident problem, and asked "what do you think we can do about it?" Then the two Soviets conversed in Russian, after which Jaffe was told "don't worry."

Later, at the advice of Kamenev, Jaffe's translator, Jaffe visited the injured Soviet at a hospital, and "brought him some booze," Jaffe continued: "They found out about this and the police were furious," insinuating that Jaffe was trying to influence the victim. A month passed, and still Jaffe did not receive an exit visa, Then "Slava" called and requested a meeting. They met in a park in Moscow. "Slava" showed Jaffe a piece of paper concerning the police charges, and tore it up in Jaffe's presence, Jaffe asked "Slava" what "Slava" wanted from him and "Slava" replied: "Forget about it. The case is closed. You have to make a financial settlement." Thereafter, Jaffe met the victim's wife, paid her 100 or 200 rubles, and she signed a statement releasing Jaffe from all other claims.

## Jaffe's "Exclusive" Regarding Khrushchev Ouster

Jaffe continued: "Khrushchev was ousted after this. 'Slava' called me and said: 'A friend of yours is out - somebody that likes you and you like.'" Jaffe continued: "I said, why are you telling me this. He said I thought you should be the first one to know."

Jaffe said he was afraid to release this story without verification, fearing it might be some sort of pro- vocation. He attempted to verify the story thought American Embassy personnel. "They said we know something is going on;" however, Jaffe got the impression they were not aware of the actual story. Jaffe then contacted a girl who worked for APN named Lyudmila (last name unknown) and asked if she was aware that an important story was breaking. She asked "Does it have anything to do with Khrushchev?" Jaffe stated only then did she confirm the story. Jaffe also stated that Victor Louis, a correspondent for the "London Evening News", also had the "exclusive" on the Khrushchev ouster. (WF T-2 has identified Vitaliy Yevgenievich Luy, aka Vitaliy Yevgeniyevich Louis, Victor E. Louis, a correspondent, married to an English girl, as an agent of the Directorate of Moscow, KGB).

## Expulsion of Jaffe from Soviet Union

Jaffe advised that after receiving the "exclusive" from "Slava" concerning the Khrushchev ouster, he continued to meet with "Slava" "on and off" until Jaffe was expelled from the Soviet Union in October, 1965. In explaining the expulsion, Jaffe said that without advising him, John Scali of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) wrote a story which Jaffe thinks was a "trial baloon", intimating that Leonid Brezhnev and Aleksei Kosygin were about to be ousted. Jaffe got a call from ABC in New York asking what he thought about Scali's story. Jaffe stated he did not believe the story was true and he asked "Slava" for his opinion. "Slava" indicated that although he would like to see it happen, he did not believe it would occur "because they were too new" as Soviet Heads of State. Jaffe continued: "The next morning, Henry Shapiro called me, asking why I had written such a story." Jaffe denied knowing anything about it. He explained that it was later that he learned that the story had been written by John Scali. (WF T-2 has identified Shapiro and his wife, Lyudmila Nikolayevna Shapiro, as KGB agents.)

At the time Scali's story broke, Jaffe and his wife were in the process of packing in preparation for their departure from Russia for Hong Kong and Jaffe's ABC successor in Moscow already had been named. The first indication Jaffe received of his expulsion was a call from ABC in New York asking what Jaffe hd done to cause the Soviets to recall the visa for Jaffe's sucessor. Jaffe said he replied: "Did you ever think it could be John Scali's story?"

Later Jaffe was called into the Soviet Foreign Office and told he had to leave the Soviet Union in ten days and that the ABC office in Moscow was being closed. Jaffe said he inquired: "Are you holding this (story) against me?" Jaffe was told that the Soviets were not, and that "we know exactly what you said about us for four years." Jaffe indicated this was the first indication he had that the Soviets had technical coverage on him. Jaffe said he did not want to leave the Soviet Union under these conditions. He said the Soviets told him, "We are not holding this against you but it has to be." Jaffe was told not to worry about the deadline for his departure and that he could get additional time. Jaffe also was told he would be able to return to Russia. He continued: "After that, everything went smoothly. They only opened one box at the Customs Office. No problems at all. I don't recall that I saw Slava again" (after his expulsion was announced).

Jaffe was asked how he was placed in contact with "Slava". He replied he was introduced to "Slava" by Yuri Fedorov. He continued: "I was dating a Russian girl and this girl got herself in trouble." Jaffe then stated: "She came to me and said that they had found out she was seeing an American and they were going to put this in the Soviet press. Fedorov said they will print your name and it will be very embarrassing." Jaffe said Fedorov then said, "I think I know someone who can help you." Jaffe indicated that Fedorov placed him in contact with "Slava", and "there was no article. It was his way of meeting me." Jaffe said he never saw the girl after that, and understood she was sent to Siberia.

In discussing his association with "Slava", Jaffe stated: "At one point when he was at my house he told me that he thought I was in CIA. Apparently he knew everything. When I first got to Russia I was tailed day and night for two months - two guys and a girl. 'Slava' said when I came over with Barbara Powers (wife of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers) and was so close to her, they thought I was with CIA and was her advisor."

Jaffe stated he first met "Slava" at a restaurant in Moscow and it was not for six or seven months from then that "Slava" first visited Jaffe's residence.

Jaffe stated: "Sedov said 'I was thumbing through our photograph files and found a picture of you taken in Red Square. You were interviewing a Russian.'" Jaffe said Sedov indicated he thought Jaffe might want the photograph and an offer was made that they get together for lunch soon. In response to inquiry, Jaffe stated Sedov's comments "sounded funny to me."

### Possible KGB Approach to Jaffe in New York

Jaffe stated that one man whom he met in New York prior to his Moscow assignment whom he never saw again was Vladimir, Barkovski, a Soviet Consular Officer. Jaffe continued: "He asked me to do some work." I had lunch with him in Sardi's Restaurant. Barkovski said, 'When Soviet journalists come over to this country they don't know the American political system. Would you (Jaffe) write out a long brief which would help them?'" Jaffe stated he told Barkovski: "I don't think I could to that. I would have to register as an agent." Jaffe continued: "He got panicky and said, 'we will pay you well.'"

In discussing his Soviet contacts, Jaffe also stated: "Another man who squired me around in Moscow was Nikolay Kalinin. I knew him very well. He was assigned to me. The last I heard, he was in Vienna as Press Officer."

## Jaffe's Dating of Foreign Nationals in Russia

Jaffe was asked if he dated any other Soviet girls. He replied he dated about three Russian girls. He continued: "The first two or three months that I moved into an apartment at about 2:00 a.m., there was a knock on the door and I opened it and here was a very attractive blond, looking for some Arab. She was loaded. She said, 'please let me use your John.' The next thing I knew she had the bathroom door locked. When I got the door open, she was undressed. I got her dressed and sat up with her all night."

Jaffe then stated that he realized the girl through whom KGB arranged for him to meet "Slava" was "a set- up." He continued: "I knew Fedorov before. There is no question he is with KGB and an APN representative."

Jaffe said he was "never intimate in a place where they (KGB) could photograph. I had a small apartment and looked everywhere for cameras."

Jaffe advised that another Soviet girl whom he dated was Tania (last name unknown), who spoke excellent English. He continued: "After I was married, she met my wife and said, 'you will never keep him. He is mine.'" Jaffe said he thinks this girl was connected with KGB. He said she was allegedly a student at Moscow University and went out with foreigners. Jaffe concluded: "After I met 'Slava', he told me to stay away from her and I did."

Jaffe was asked if he dated any other foreign nationals. He stated: "I dated a Finnish girl who was studying ballet at the Bolshoi Theater - the primo ballerina of the Helsinki Ballet Company," who was of Russian origin. Jaffe continued: "I took out the Second Secretary of the Danish Embassy for a long time. She later transferred. She wanted to get married."

Jaffe stated he did not suspect that any of the non-Russian girls whom he dated were connected with KGB. He indicated that he met these girls at the American House Club by chance and he does not believe the associations were KGB inspired. Jaffe also stated: "Another girl I dated for quite a while was a beatnik type." He continued: "My wife, before we were married, dated a Russian, allegedly a student. He tried to set her up but she pulled out because she was working for the American Embassy."

## Information Requested by "Slava"

In response to inquiries, Jaffe stated "Slava" was especially interested in important current events such as "the Cuban crisis - things like that - what our (U.S.) reactions would be." Jafe also stated: "He would ask me about some guy" at the American Embassy, such as Dick Gabey and Manuel Oliver." Jaffe indicated that his responses would be that he did not get close to these people or he only had a drink with them but did not learn anything significant. Jaffe continued: "He ('Slava') would say 'They talk to some of the correspondents.' I would say 'I never have any occasion, because with radio (ABC) you don't go into depth.'"

Jaffe also stated: "He was also very much interested in the Time, Incorporated group that came over there (Russia). What do they say. What do they talk about." Jaffe stated: "I said they are looking into expanding trade." Jaffe was asked to list any business or political groups visitng Russia in which "Slava" expressed an interest. Jaffe mentioned the Time, Incorporated businessmen group, the Rockefeller visit and a Business International Group.

Jaffe was asked why KGB would have considered him a good contact or recruited agent. He replied "I don't know why they would consider me a good contact or recruited agent, because there was nothing I could furnish them." He continued: "I could see why they thought I was so interesting. I figure they wanted something in the future,"

Jaffe said "Slava" would ask him if he was aware of or expected to be with a particular group and Jaffe would answer in the affirmative or would indicate he might cover such a group; however, he would tell "Slava", "I have no entree to these people." Jafe continued: "He consulted me about several people over there. My answer always was, 'I know the guy. I had a drink with him but I didn't get close.' I said, 'I have no real reason.'" Jaffe indicated that he merely furnished "Slava" his opinions concerning matters of interest to "Slava." Jaffe concluded that "Slava" made no arrangements to recontact him after his expulsion from the Soviet Union, He stated: "I never saw this man since." Jaffe stated he saw two Soviet engineers aboard a Soviet ship in Hong Kong and had them to lunch at his residence; however, he initiated these coacts himself.

Identifications of Soviet Contacts

On March 21, 1969, when requested to review numerous photographs of Soviet nationals and comment concerning his recollections of them, Jaffe stated he has a very poor recollection of names of individuals; however, he has a very good recollection of faces of individuals he has met.

Subsequently, when shown a group of photographs of Soviet nationals identified by WF T-2 as officers of the KGB, including photographs of Barkovski and his wife, Jaffe again identified Barkovski and also indicated he recognized his wife.

    WF T-2 identified Barkovski as a KGB officer who was KGB Resident in the United States in the late 1950's; in 1962 was Chief of the First (American) Department of the First Chief Directorate (FCD), KGB; and in 1963 was appointed Deputy Chief of the newly created Scientific - Technical Directorate, FCD, KGB.

11. Konstantin Grigorevich Fedoseev: Employed as counselor at Soviet Delegation to UN, New York City. Jaffe described him as a nice little man who did not speak good English. His wife, who spoke excellent English, is very close to the wife of Vladimir Barkovski. On one occasion, Jaffe took Fedoseev to the Press Club.

12. Vadim Yevgenyevich/Golovanov: Jaffe stated he and his wife were very fond of Golovanov, an employee of Radio Moscow who formerly attended Stanford University. His wife previously was at "M.K.U." Jaffe stated Golovanov and his wife were "one of the few Russians who had us to his apart-ment. Very decent... A young man who I think could be swayed. Wants to understand Americans. Gave me tape of Russian music and I gave him tapes of American music. I do not think he was KGB." (Jaffe indicated he feels he can spot CIA officers, FBI agents, and KGB employees.)

Jaffe stated Golovanov worked in the American Department of Radio Moscow, interviewing American personalities coming to Russia for Radio Moscow radio programs.

I don't think he is KGB, but a member of Central Committee. I don't think KGB would have a man in that kind of job. He knew Hagerty very well when Hagerty was Press Secretary," Jaffe stated he "got more things because of this man" than through any other Soviet national.

Later they ended up on the Soviet ship "Drugba" (phonetic) where a conversation ensued. Jaffe did not see Kevorkov again until a year or two later in Moscow. According to Jaffe, when Larrimore was ultimately expelled from Poland "there was a KGB fake story which recalled the conversation (on the Soviet ship) and meeting at Helsinki." Jaffe stated he (Jaffe) was not mentioned in the story and he indicated that the only party who could have furnished the information in the story was Kevorkov, which convinced Jaffe that Kevorkov is connected with KGB.

Professor Frederick Barghoorn

Jaffe advised that another "exclusive" he obained while in Moscow was information about the release of Professor Frederick Barghoorn. Jaffe obtained this "exclusive" from Mikhail "Mike" Bruk, "a guy who never pumped me." He said Bruk was an employee of APN, an "extremely interesting man, a fine linguist" who normally covers scientific matters. Jaffe stated it is his opinion that the release of Barghoorn was the culmination of a fight between Khrushchev and the KGB and his opinion was confirmed by statements made to him by Yuri Vinogradov that Khrushchev initially was not aware that Barghoorn was being detained and after he learned of it he insisted, over the objections of KGB, that he be released.

Jaffe said he learned beforehand of the expected release of Barghoorn while attending a Soviet-American Friendship meeting with Bruk and Vinogradov, He continued: "Mike (Bruk) took me out in the hall. He said he (Barghoorn) will be released. He will leave here tomorrow for London." Jaffe said the release occurred on a Saturday and no British European Airways (BEA) flight is scheduled from Moscow on Saturday; however, the BEA plane was detained and did not depart until Saturday, with Barghoorn.

## Activities in Hong Kong

Jaffe indicated that "in order to keep up on my Russian and to buy caviar and vodka," he and New York correspondent Ian Stewart visited the "S.S. Bikal", a Soviet cruise ship plying between Hong Kong and Siberia. Jaffe indicated that one unusual incident occurred on the ship. Jaffe asked if the ship had any delux cabins and was escorted by a Soviet female guide to the cabin. The door was locked. She knocked and upon receiving no answer, unlocked the door. They saw two Russian caucasians talking to a Chinese national. The Chinese national immediately turned his head away from the Americans and kept it turned away thoughout their stay in the cabin. The Russians appeared upset and one asked "What are you doing here?" The girl explained that the Americans were touring the ship and tried to show them the cabin hurriedly. It was obvious to Jaffe that she wanted to get out of the cabin as soon as possible; however, Jaffe inquired about and insisted upon being shown the cabin's toilet. Jaffe concluded: "As we were leaving, I turned around and said in Russian, 'Thank you very much.'" Jaffe indicated the fact that he could speak Russian obviously shocked the Russian nationals.

Jaffe stated he developed an association with two Russians on the ship who "had been trying to get into Hong Kong xor some time. I think they were engineers." Jaffe said he invited them to his residence where they had lunch with Ken Bernstein, of National Broadcasting Company and another in- dividual whose name Jaffe cannot recall. One of the Soviet engineers was quite open in his concern about the Soviet occupa- tion of Czechoslovakia. Jaffe also learned that Hong Kong was doing 100 million dollars of business repairing Soviet tankers, freighters and cruise ships, Jaffe said the Soviet engineers were very anxious to obtain visas for their wives and children to enter Hong Kong.

Jaffe also advised he had contacts with CIA and British Intelligence in Hong Kong as a result of his contacts with a Red Chinese national, Szeto Kung, the news editor of the Chinese News Agency. After being introduced to Szeto by an individual who works for Reuters, Jaffe told Szeto about his assignment in Russia. An association between Jaffe and Szeto ensued. Jaffe indicated to Szeto that he was very anxious to go to Red China. Jaffe indicated that in 1955, he was granted an interview by Chou En Lai.

After his initial contacts with Szeto, Jaffe observed him several times, "but he never recognized me or my camera man." Subsequently Jaffe called Szeto and asked him if he could get Jaffe some Mao banners. Szeto indicated they were difficult to obtain, but he would try. They later met at a restaurant and Szeto gave him some Mao banners. Szeto asked Jaffe his attitude toward the Hong Kong crisis and how the British had reacted and whether or not their hostility had tapered off. Jaffe stated: "I said I was pretty sore about the British newspaper man being held in China." Szeto replied that the British were holding one of their (China's) men.

Jaffe stated Szeb invited him to lunch several days later and indicated that things were getting better in China; however, "we still have trouble in Canton, but we think everything is toning down. The Red Guards are going back to school." They also talked about developing better relations with the United States in the future and Szeto in- dicated that a Communist Party Congress would be held this year in China.

When Jaffe was packing to return to the United States, he contacted Szeto and Szeto suggested that they get together. Jaffe indicated he would like to introduce his wife to Szeto. This was agreeable and Szeto took them to dinner on the eve of the Chinese Anniversary. Szeto brought up the subject of keeping in touch with. Jaffe, indicating that he did not desire to contact him through ABC. It was decided that after Jaffe got settled in the United States, he would write Szeto at the Chinese News Agency office in Hong Kong and furnish his mailing address. Jaffe again indicated to Szeto his strong desire to get assigned to China. Jaffe said he had cleared this "with the Agency (CIA)" prior to his conversation with Szeto. Jaffe stated his CIA contact in Hong Kong "at one point showed me a report on him (Szeto). He told about taking groups of people to China. He had been abroad but never to this country (United States). He obviously was a liaison man with the Foreign press. I think it was a surprise to CIA and the State Department that he (Szeto) would see us (the Jaffes)."

Jaffe stated all his contacts with the Soviets have been cordial. The only time he felt out of place and embarrassed in connection with his Soviet contacts was when he attended the Soviet Air Forces Day celebration at the Soviet Embassy. He explained that John Lynch of ABC had been invited but said he could not make it and gave Jaffe his ticket. Jaffe continued: "When they (the Soviets) saw me there they seemed surprised and asked: 'What are you doing here?' One of the guys said he had seen my piece on Russian trawlers. Kalugin did most of the taking. Asked what I was doing. I said I was John Lynch's replacement. Later Lynch and his wife showed up with a sister-in-law."

Jaffe said the Soviets asked what he was doing with ABC. He replied be had expected to cover the State Department but he is on general assignment to get the feel of the country since he has been away for so long.

Jaffe said on the night of the Soviet Air Forces Day celebration, he also met a member of the Soviet Press Department_who_expressed great interest in Jaffe and indicated a desire to get together again. However, he has had no additional contact with this individual..

Jaffe also had contact with the new Counselor of Press Affairs at the Soviet Embassy. Jaffe inquired about the possibility of touring one of the Soviet "mother ships." This Soviet merely suggested that Jaffe "write a letter."

"Sasha," who broke down and cried when he related the story to Jaffe, said he made the girl pregnant and she had threatened to come down to his office and complain. Jaffe said he asked "Slava" about this, and his only comment was "they weren't very good" employees. Jaffe said the translator's replacement was a "great big goon type who knew nothing," and Jaffe fired him.

Jaffe stated he left Russia about a month after the Scali story broke. He continued: "I had already reported the denial based on what I saw and believed, but ABC didn't use them radio did but TV didn't." Jaffe stated the Soviets were aware of the ABC radio denial but they asked Jaffe why the denial did not appear on television, stating "the impact was created on TV." According to Jaffe, this is why Henry Shapiro, UPI correspondent, called and complained. Then Reuter's called. Jaffe said he replied: "No, gentlemen, I have knocked the story down." Jaffe again commented that it was only when the Soviets indicated they were aware of his criticism of the story "that I knew I had been bugged. They knew everything I said."

## Activities with "Slava"

Jaffe was asked if he could recall any United States groups visiting Russia in which "Slava" expressed an interest. Jaffe mentioned the Time-Life Group and the Business International Group. He was asked if "Slava" expressed an interest in any group connected with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He answered in the affirmative and stated, "They expressed interest in what people were saying. I said, 'everybody was happy to see it.'" Jaffe continued: "I went up with Vice President (Hubert) Humphrey and we went to Gorki Park and interviewed Russians." As Humphrey talked to the Russians, Jaffe recorded the interviews on his tape recorder. A translator from the American Embassy eccompanied Humphrey and Jaffe.

Jaffe then stated: "I was never asked in advance to get anything; always after the fact." Jaffe was asked if "Slava" ever made inquiries concerning American groups prior to their arrival in Russia. He replied: "A couple of times he would say, 'a group is coming in. Do you think you will be covering it?' I was never asked specifically to do anything."

Jaffe was asked if "Slava" ever asked anything about being contacted by the FBI. He answered in the affirmative and indicated that this occurred two or three months after he met "Slava". Jaffe said he told "Slava" that FBI agents indicated they were aware that he "bumped into these guys" and "sees a lot of Russians" and they requested him to furnish information about his Russian contacts. Jaffe said he deliberately lied to "Slava", telling him "I told these people (FBI), 'Sorry, I am a news man. These are my sources.'" Jaffe said he did not know whether or not "Slava" believed him; however, he never questioned Jaffe's comments.

Jaffe was asked if he was ever warned that United States authorities might be aware of his association with "Slava." He replied in the affirmative, stating, "He called me for lunch and told me that a guy defected from Geneva who worked with him ('Slava') and knew of several of his contacts and I was one of them." "Slava" then told Jaffe, "If you are ever asked anything about me, deny any knowledge of me."

Jaffe later indicated that "Slava" warned him of the defector shortly after Jaffe read the story in the press that a Soviet national disappeared in Switzerland. Jaffe continued: "He (Slava') was actually concerned because the man had a lot of valuable information. He said he worked with 'Slava' for a while and then he was in another department higher position. He knew him ('Slava') personally. And he said he couldn't understand why the man would do anything like defecting. He said, 'Don't say anything about knowing me to anyone.' He was very, very worried." Jaffe said he learned at about the time he was leaving Russia that "Slava" was "being demoted and was going into another area. He wasn't happy. I think he felt he had more to offer."

When again requested to relate the circumstances of his introduction to "Slava", Jaffe stated he was dating a Soviet girl. He said he did not believe the Soviets have any compromising photographs of their activities; however, the girl told him she had been called up before the review board of the factory where she worked and embarrassed because of her association with an American. She told Jaffe, that the whole story would appear in "Izvestia" or some other Soviet newspaper. Jaffe continued: "At this point Fedorov befriended me. He said, 'I hear by the grapevine you are in a little hot water.' I acknowledged this but said I didn't think there was anything wrong with seeing a Soviet girl. He said it could be very serious, your name could be written in 'Izvestia'". Jaffe indicated Fedorov got "very melodramatic." He continued: "I was scared of the automobile accident (in which he hit a pedestrian). But I wasn't scared about this." Jaffe then related again that Fedorov introduced "Slava" to him as an individual who could keep his name out of the newspapers.

It was pointed out to Jaffe that he first mentioned "Slava" to the FBI in January, 1963, and he was asked if he could recall the information he furnished at that time regarding attendance at a party and flat tires. He then related that he had attended a party with a girl friend and had a few drinks. At about 1:00 a.m., he wasdriving in an area not familiar to him and noticed he was being "tailed." Then he observed a "detour left" sign. He turned left as directed, subsequently he noticed the surveilling car continue on the road he had left. He then abruptly fell into a big hole and all four tires were flattened by the severe fall. The girl

volunteered to go for help, stating: "let me make a telephone call. I think I can find one. I can speak the language better than you." After about 30 minutes had passed and the girl had not returned Jaffe got a cab and returned home at about 3:00 a.m. He continued: I got a call about five or six (am) from the girl. She had been picked up and taken to the police station near the American Embassy, which was not in this district (where the automobile was disabled). She said, I must see you right away. She came to my apartment. She had bruises on her and had been crying. Her eyes were swollen. She told me she had been interrogated by the KGB." Jaffe said the girl said she was in very serious trouble and was accused of seeing other foreigners. She had insisted to Jaffe that the only other foreigner with whom she associated was a Negro, the Senegalese Ambassador to Russia. Jaffe said he gave her breakfast and then she went home. He continued: "The next time I saw her, she said she would be called up by her factory" and reprimanded.

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe stated:
"I think my expulsion (from Russia) came as much as a surprise to him ('Slava') as to me. I didn't see him after the expulsion order came in." Jaffe again stated: "'Slava' knew I was leaving. He knew I was going to Hong Kong."

Jaffe again indicated he was already preparing to leave Moscow for Hong Kong when the expulsion order came in. He stated he and his wife were tired of being in Moscow. He said ABC wanted him to remain in Russia but Jaffe did not. While in Paris on a trip, he threatened to quit if he could not leave Moscow. Jaffe stated: "My business wanted me to stay but I didn't. I din't want to be another Henry Shapiro. I didn't want to let my kid get educated there." In explaining why he wanted to leave Russia, Jaffe stated: "There were goons around all the time - a lot of pressure - and guys string you along."

In answer to a specific question, Jaffe stated:
"'Slava' in no way, shape or form said 'I would be in touch with you again.'" Jaffe insisted that since his departure from the Soviet Union he has had no contacts with Soviets except at his own initiative with the exception of the recent contact by Boris Sedov.

## Activities on Behalf of Naval Intelligence

Jaffe stated that on one occasion he attempted to perform a task for Naval Intelligence. He received permission to travel in the North Sea aboard a Soviet Ice Breaker "Lenin" and prior to starting this assignment, he was briefed by Naval Attaches at the American Embassy, Moscow, on their interests including any observations he might make of Soviet atomic submarines. Accompanying Jaffe on the trip was Dieter. Steiner, another foreign correspondent in Moscow. Jaffe did not observe any atomic submarines and every time the ship neared a Soviet naval base, the guests were told the Captain desired to brief them below deck in his cabin. By the time the briefings were over, the ship had passed the naval bases. On one occasion, Jaffe, while en route to the Captain's cabin, realized he had left his photographic equipment on deck. He returned to get it and was approached by Soviet Naval Officers who reminded him he was expected to be receiving a briefing in the Captain's cabin; however, he was not reprimanded and was treated well throughout the cruise.

While in Riga, Jaffe and Steiner observed a group of buoys in a large channel which were spaced uniform distances apart. Jaffe and Dieter finally redized that by photographing these buoys, the size of various Soviet ships passing through the channel could be ascertained, and they attempted to take photographs, but wee told this was not permitted. They protested and the next morning the Cultural Committee agreed to let them photograph the area. When they arrived at the channel they discovered that all the buoys had been removed. Jaffe said he is convinced the Soviets worked throughout the night removing the buoys.

## Jaffe's Difficulties with AEC and CIA

Jaffe indicated he believed his recall by ABC from Hong Kong was caused by or influenced by an agency or agencies of the United States Government. He indicated he was told by a British Intelligence contact in Hong Kong that he was recalled because he refused to cooperate with CIA in Hong Kong. Jaffe said he recently mentioned this to a CIA contact in Washington, D.C., and was told the British Intelligence representative " had no right to tell you this."

Jaffe stated he also was told by other contacts that British Intelligence was investigating him and desired to know as much as possible about him; however, British Intelligence had not initiated the inquiry, but was obtaining the information for another organization.

Jaffe also indicated he was concerned that a recent publication had falsely reported that he was a member of a left wing organization. Jaffe then stated: "I would like to get this thing cleaned up. I feel that I have been pulled back here."

Jaffe was advised that the FBI had absolutely nothing to do with his return to the United States from Hong Kong and did not have any contact with ABC with regard to him. He was also told that it is difficult to understand why he had not previously advised the FBI of some of the information concerning his activities in Russia which he has now related. Jaffe said he felt that he had told the FBI enough but admitted he had not furnished complete information concerning his activities in Russia, including the warning by "Slava" concerning the KGB defector. He admitted the FBI had a right to expect him to do so. He continued: "I was afraid of this guy. I was damn interested and curious - he was an intense man - someone who gave me more information than I gave him. I was afraid I might meet with an automobile accident." Jaffe said he did not tell the FBI "everything because with that guy - I was scared. I am not on their side in any way. There are a lot of things wrong with it, but I love it (the United States) - I try to be middle of the road - I have been in Vietnam - I am not a Soviet spy and not a Communist. I was frightened. This man was a very threatening man. This man could have killed.

He felt that strong about the old country - Stalin - I think he was as vicious as Semichastnyy and Shelepin (former Chairmen of the KGB) - I went up (and talked) to them. Semichastnyy said, 'Yes, I know you. What do you want?'" Jaffe explained this occured at a reception.

## SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Jaffe stated that "Slava" might have thought that he (Jaffe) was "Slava's" agent. He continued: "Little things came out of 'Slava', but I never knew exactly what he did. I do know I would tell him what I would think, which is not a secret." Jaffe, indicated he never told "Slava" or any other Soviet connected with Soviet Intelligence anything other than his own observations and opinions and denied furnishing any information from any Government documents. He also emphatically denied that KGB had made any arrangements for meeting him after he left Moscow or that thee had been any such meetings since he left Moscow. Ile said nobody had followed up "Slava's" contacts with him.

In response to a specific question, Jaffe stated he did not think "Slava" had anything to do with his expulsion from Russia. He continued: "My guess is John Scali, who is very close to CIA" was responsible for the expulsion. Jaffe continued: "John wanted to set me up with CIA.. They (CIA) would do things in indirect ways." Jaffe then related an incident in which Scali invited several ABC employees to a party, including an individual introduced to Jaffe as an employee of the Department of Commerce, who expressed very much interest in Jafe's assignment to Russia. Jaffe later verified that this individual was connected with CIA and he feels it would have been better if the individual had been completely open with him.

Jaffe then stated: "I still believe CIA sent me to Moscow on the (Francis Gary) Powers trial. Prior to the trial, he was approached by a CIA representative in California who indicated he was aware Jaffe would be sent to Moscow by Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). Jaffe stated he (Jaffe) was not aware of it at that time. Jaffe said he subsequently was told by another CIA representative whom he met while attending meetings of the Council on Foreign Relations that he had been picked to go to Moscow with Barbara Powers and help Marvin Kalb, CBS correspondent, cover the trial. On the eve of his departure, a CIA representative who claimed he was a psychiatrist gave Jaffe background material on spy trials and said "they were very much interested in determining if Powers is brainwashed." Jaffe related that Barbara Powers developed a friendship with him and constantly sought his company and advice and expressed a strong dislike for CIA personnel accompanying them. Jaffe, at the insistance of Mrs. Powers, wrote a letter to the President of the Soviet Union appealing for clemency for Powers. Jaffe continued: "There was nothing physical between us. We went down town (in Moscow) and went to the KGB building (at the request of Mrs. Powers, who insisted on seeing the building). This was the first time she cried. Then we went back. The next morning was the trial. The next thing I know I am sitting down in the VIP section. They wrote that I was a member of the family. The game (with CIA) has been going on for a long time."

## SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

In response to a specific question, Jaffe stated: "'Slava' never said anything about the trial except to say they (KGB) thought I was with CIA. Later he said they knew I was not."

Jaffe again indicated that he felt some United States Government agency was responsible for his recall from Hong Kong and that it had some connection with an "intelligence" allegation. He also indicated dislike for his present assignment with ABC in Washington, D.C., stating that although he had hoped to cover the "diplomatic beat" or the State Department, he is merely on general assignment, sitting around waiting for miscellaneous stories to break.

Jaffe also stated: "I was a bit afraid of 'Slava'. I was waiting for them (KGB) to_contact me in Hong Kong. I thought it would have come there." Jaffe also stated: "You (FBI) have a right, after our relationship" to inquire about Jaffe's activities and "I have a right to an answer in all honesty" concerning the reason_for the recall from Hong Kong.

Jaffe stated that when he returned from Hong Kong he asked the head of ABC for an explanation of his recall and was told he had not produced and had refused to return to Vietnam. Jaffe denied both accusations. Jaffe then went to his immediate superior and was told he was recalled because of a cable he sent from Saigon. Jaffe asked to be shown the cable, but his request was refused. The discussion between Jaffe and his immediate superior became very heated, with the superior loudly accusing Jaffe of being a liar and Jaffe suggesting that the superior was mentally ill for shouting at him and refusing to show him the cable. Jaffe stated he had seriously considered leaving ABC; however, during the last week of March, 1969, he signed another contract with ABC. Jaffe said he is quite satisfied with the salary involved, but dislikes very much being on general assignment. He again indicated he is trying to obtain an assignment to Red China and also is attempting to obtain an assignment to Cuba.

In explaining his difficulties with ABC in Vietnam, Jaffe stated that ABC correspondents in Hong Kong are rotated on assignments to Vietnam and Korea and it was understood that the assignments in Vietnam would never exceed one month's duration. While Jaffe was in Vietnam on an assignment, his sound man, a Chinese boy, was wounded, and the cameraman,

a brother-in-law of the sound man, "said we had to get out (of Vietnam). I telephoned the Bureau Chief in Saigon and I said my month is up and we want to go back (to Hong Kong)." Jaffe received a cable from headquarters stating "Tell Jaffe to hold fast." Jaffe then sent cables reminding ABC of the oral agreement or understanding concerning the duration of assignments in Vietnam, and he ultimately received a cable stating: "Tell Jaffe if he can't do job, quit." Jaffe said he later learned that the agreement that correspondents -would serve only a month at a time in Vietnam had been cancel-led.

## Jaffe's Attitude Concerning Subsequent Contacts with Boris Sedov

Jaffe indicated he was concerned about what effect subsequent contacts with Boris Sedov might have on his career with ABC, particularly if Sedov's contacts might lead to another KGB approach. Jaffe was told that he alone could made a decision concerning his future contacts with Soviet nationals; that the FBI would not request that he continue these contacts; but the FBI would be interested in any information concerning contacts with anyone which Jaffe feels represents an attempt by foreign intelligence to cultivate him.

TOP SECRET

On April 22, 1969, a confidential source, who has furnished reliable information in the past, furnished the following information:

Sam Jaffe, a correspondent employed by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in their Washington, D.C. office, met Dr. and Mrs. CHANG Hsin-hai in Washington about two weeks ago.

Dr. CHANG Hsin-hai is a former Chinese Nationalist official who is currently an advocate of relations between the United States and Communist China. He is a faculty member at Fairleigh Dickinson University, Teaneck, New Jersey. Mrs. CHANG is retired from employment in the United Nations Secretariat, where she worked in the Radio Section.

Jaffe told the CHANGs that he was very interested In meeting with Paul Lin, faculty member at Mc Gill University, Montreal, for the purpose of interviewing him.

Jaffe, since his contact with the CHANGS, has contacted Lin by phone. Jaffe has stated that Lin's reception of his proposition was rather cool. Lin told Jaffe he would be willing to talk with him, but would not give him an interview for publication.

Source advised that although Jaffe has told Lin that he wishes to interview him, his real purpose in contacting Lin is to gain Lin's assistance in obtaining permission for Jaffe, to travel to Communist China. Jaffe has said that he first heard of Lin in 1954, at the Bandung Conference. Jaffe, at that time, was employed by the "Nation", a magazine on national and international affairs published in the United States. Jaffe said at that time he asked U. Nu of Burma,

DATE: 3/11/69

1 - Mr. E. C. Peterson

Recommends interview of subject to clarify details of his contacts with Soviet Intelligence Service (SIS) in the USSR and so that determination can be made as to his suitability for further reporting on contacts with SIS personnel in this country.

Subject has been assigned as Washington correspondent for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) since the Fall of 1968. From 1958 until 1961, he voluntarily furnished information to the New York Office concerning his contacts with Soviet officials in that city. In November, 1961, he was transferred to Moscow by ABC and while on vacation trip to the United States during January, 1963, he reported to the New York Office what appeared to be recruitment effort of him by SIS. Insufficient time was available for complete debriefing of him and in 1965 he was expelled by Soviets with subsequent transfer to Hong Kong by ABC.

The Soviet defector, has advised that subject was recruited by SIS about 1962 but he did not know if Jaffe was considered an agent or just an operative contact. During November, 1968, subject indicated he would like to have contacts with Bureau in Washington, D. C., in same manner as he had previously been in New York; however, contacts were not initiated since it was desired to reinterview in order to clarify his previous comments which has been completed but no additional information elicited. During February, 1969, he telephonically informed the New York Office of contacts with Soviets in Washington, D. C., and again evinced desire to be interviewed by Bureau personnel.

Our files contain no derogatory information concerning Jaffe. Although he is not regular contact of Crime Records Division, there is nothing in our relations with ABC which would preclude an interview of him. His request to be contacted would serve as basis for approach to him after which details of his association with SIS personnel in USSR could be fully explored and a determination made as to whether or not we should continue to utilize him as a source or informant against Soviet personnel in Washington, D. C.

ReBulet, 2/20/69, instructing that no contact should be made with captioned individual without prior Bureau authority.

WFO has reviewed the detailed material furnished by NYlets dated 1/22/69 and 2/12/69, in response to WFOlets dated 11/6/68 and 12/19/68. In addition, the contents of NYairtel 2/6/69 and Bulet 2/20/69 have been considered. WFO believes that a thorough, detailed, and comprehensive interview of this individual should be conducted in the near future for the following reasons:

1) This source was operated by the New York Office since 1958, when he voluntarily informed the New York Office of his contacts with Soviet officials connected with the Soviet Mission to the United Nations. During the period 1958 - 1961, he furnished New York with information regarding Soviet personalities and activities considered important by the New York Office. In November, 1961, he assumed the position of ABC television correspondent in Moscow. On 1/7/63, while on a short return trip to the United States, he reported to the New York Office that in October, 1962, he had been interviewed by a representative of the KGB as a result of an association with a Soviet female. The KGB officer had met with him on several occasions and indicated the Soviets would like to know Western reaction to Soviet moves, particularly moves in

situations like the Cuban crisis. He also requested the source to bring him a miniphone recording machine from the United States. Source stated that he had never experienced anything else which would indicate the Soviets were attempting to compromise him.

Source was expelled by the Soviets in 1965, only after it was known to KGB that he was to be replaced by ABC. Shortly after his return to the United States, he was assigned to Hong Kong by ABC and has not been thoroughly debriefed concerning his activities in Moscow.

2) Soviet defector advised that this individual (SAM JAFFE) was recruited by the KGB about 1962. He said when JAFFE arrived in 1961, the First Department of the Second Chief Directorate (SCD), which operated against the American Embassy, and the Tenth Department of SCD, which operated against foreign correspondents, consulted and it was decided that the First Department would operate against JAFFE for the purpose of recruiting an American agent moving in American Embassy circles. said that in 1962 or 1963, VYACHESLAV ALEKSANDROVICH KUSKOV was working with JAFFE, but did not know if JAFFE was considered as an agent or just an operative contact. He did know that KUSKOV was meeting JAFFE and obtained information from him. re-called also that JAFFE was used by KGB in connection with trips of two groups of Americans to the USSR, where they met with Premier KHRUSHCHEV. The Seventh Department of SCD, which was working against tourists (of which , the Tenth Department, and the First Department were all planning work against these groups. KGB desired to operate agents against them to find out what was said by them after meeting with KHRUSHCHEV. He recalled that KUSKOV had been requested to utilize JAFFE in this connection and furnished information which he had received from JAFFE. said one group was a group of businessmen which met with KHRUSHCHEV on 11/6/62 or possibly 1963, and another group contained some Congress-men who came to the USSR in connection with the signing of some treaty pertaining to atomic energy.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 351

WFO 105-8906

From comments, it is clear that KGB considered JAFFE as at least a cooperative source and it is clear that JAFFE was furnishing some type of information to KGB officer KUSKOV.

3) Since JAFFE's arrival in Washington, D.C. in the Fall of 1965, he has been observed in contact with Soviet officials assigned to Washington, D.C. In addition, on 11/14/68, he approached some WFO Agents who were conducting a surveillance on satellite personnel and indicated that he would like to have contact with the FBI in Washington, D.C. in the same manner as he had previously had contact in New York. He indicated that he was in contact with Soviets in Washington, D.C. and would report on them. WFO did not initiate contact with him at that time because it was desired to obtain from New York the complete details of New York's relations with him, and it was also desired to interview concerning him. As indicated above, the New York material has now been reviewed and was interviewed concerning JAFFE by WFO Agents on 2/11/69.

It is considered entirely possible that JAFFE, while in Moscow, furnished only innocuous information to his KGB contact and did not consider that he was a recruited agent or source of KGB. He should be given an opportunity to describe his activities in Moscow. Based upon review of information pertaining to him, it appears that he could be a good source against Soviets in Washington, D.C., provided he is candid concerning his activities in Moscow and is not, in fact, a recruited agent continuing to report to KGB. It is believed that an interview with him is necessary to assess this potential.

4) As indicated in NYairtel, JAFFE appears to be concerned regarding derogatory information which has appeared in a book written by PHOEBE GREENE COURTNEY. He has related these allegations to his recall from Hong Kong by his employer and is concerned regarding the allegation

of disloyalty. It would appear that this may be a propitious time to interview JAFFE in an effort to completely debrief him concerning his contacts with Soviets during his tour in Moscow and in Hong Kong, as well as concerning his recent contacts with Soviets in Washington, D.C. -C-

If the Bureau approves interview with JAFFE, it is contemplated that he will be advised that WFO Agents desire to renew contacts with him previously initiated by New York Agents. He will be invited to the Washington Field Office to discuss in some detail his tour of duty in Moscow and his contacts with Soviets since his return to this country. It will be pointed out that WFO desires to display to him a large number of photographs of Soviets in this country and in Russia to obtain his comments. If JAFFE agrees, he will first be requested to describe in detail his activities in Moscow and in particular, his contacts with the KGB subsequent to those reported in January, 1963. He will also be asked if he had any contacts with Soviets while in Hong Kong and if so, to describe them. Thereafter, he will be requested to describe 'in detail his contacts with Soviets since his return to this country. During the course of the interview, he will be shown photographs of KGB officers assigned to the Second Chief Directorate in Moscow, as well as photographs of Soviets currently assigned to Washington, D.C. Also during the course of the interview, it is contemplated that he will be informed that a Soviet defector has advised that he furnished information to KGB officer KUSKOV, and he will be requested to specify what information he furnished. In particular, he will be questioned concerning the two groups of Americans who visited with KHRUSHCHEV, concerning which he made reports to KGB. Every effort will be made to obtain accurate information from JAFFE as a means of assessing his potential. If it appears that he is not candid, it is believed that no further consideration should be given to utilizing him as an active source, but information volunteered by him should be accepted. Also if he

SUBJECT:

(00: WF)

On the evening of 2/5/69, telephonically contacted the NYO and wanted to speak with SA EDWARD F. GAMBER immediately. In SA GAMBER's absence, he asked that SA GAMBER telephonically contact him as soon as possible at telephone #657-9774 in Chevy Chase, Md.

telephone call was returned.

His purpose in calling was to advise the Bureau that his employer, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), was in receipt of 2 copies of a new book entitled "America's Unelected Rulers of the Council on Foreign Relations", which was written by PHOEBE GREENE COURTNEY of New Orleans, La. According to informant, this book lists a number of people who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations who have subversive backgrounds. The informant is one of the individuals listed in this book. According to informant, another section of this book accuses him of being a member of the American League for Peace and Democracy. The informant is quite incensed over the information contained in this book concerning himself and connected the information contained in this book with his recent recall from Hong Kong by ABC. He further advised that he has consulted an attorney about this matter and intends to seek the advice of US Government officials with whom he is acquainted in WDC.

Informant advised that he has never been a member of the American League for Peace and Democracy although he has been a member for many years of the Council on Foreign Relations. Informant went on to state that he wanted to be certain that this would be a matter of record in Bureau Headquarters as well as the fact that there is not one word of truth concerning him in the book. Informant stated that he understands that COURTNEY and her husband reside in New Orleans, La, and are considered to be erratic individuals in the area of anti-Communist activity.

NYO indices contain no information concerning COURTNEY.

Informant was told to handle any matters of interest which he wished to call to the attention of the Bureau through the WFO and to refrain from calling the NYO in the future unless he was present in NYC. Informant then said that he has been in contact with BORIS G. STRELNIKOV, Pravda correspondent, in WDC, and he could not understand why he has not been contacted by Bureau agents as he would like to be of assistance to the Bureau at the present time as he has been in the past.

It is the opinion of the NYO that the American Broadcasting Company has not been entirely satisfied with informant's work and he was probably recalled from Hong Kong for this reason. The informant, in turn, has concluded that his recall was due to some allegation of disloyalty in view of a comment made to him in Hong Kong by a British official. The aforementioned book and its contents have served to confirm in informant's mind that the reason for his recall from Hong Kong, in fact, stemmed from an allegation of disloyalty.

The above information is being furnished to the Bureau and WFO for information and the NYO does not contemplate taking any further action in this matter.

ReNYairtel 2/6/69 wherein information telephonically furnished by subject to the New York Office 2/5/69 is set forth.

Subject indicated displeasure over the fact that his name was listed in a book titled "America's Unelected Rulers of the Council on Foreign Relations," which was written by Phoebe Greene Courtney of New Orleans, Louisiana. The book had apparently been sent to subject's employer, American Broadcasting Company (ADC) in New York and he believed that the information concerning him had some connection with his recent recall from Hong Kong by ABC.

Bufiles show that Phoebe Greene Courtney and her husband, Kent, are mentioned numerous times as right wing authors and publishers who have been known for their extreme views concerning Chief Justice Earl Warren. For a number of years they have published "The CSA Newsletter" which is indicated to be for members of the Conservative Society of America, EO. Box 4254, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70118. Kent Courtney was reportedly to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with hearings concerning the appointment of Abe Fortas as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. They have also published numerous other right wing periodicals and (pamphlets; however, Eureau has not conducted any investigation of them. The information furnished by subject indicates the book he mentioned was only recently published; however, Bufiles indicate that book with same name was published by the Courtneys during 1962. (62-5-11087; 62-107722)

The above is for your information and completion of your files.

Since subject indicated to the New York Office that he has been in contact with a Soviet correspondent in Washington, D. C., and that he would like to again be of assistance to Bureau, it would appear that his offer in this regard would

ReNYlet 12/10/68 which furnished serials pertaining to the initial development of the source and copies of evaluation letters and memoranda since that time.

WFO does not consider the material furnished by NY adequate for evaluation of this source. The attention of NY is directed to information furnished by which indicated that the subject was recruited by the KGB and subsequently was considered to be a valuable agent who was used to acquire information on individuals in whom KGB was interested. It is also noted that the subject was expelled from Moscow after it was known to the KGB that he was to be replaced and a visa had been issued to his replacement. Subject's expulsion could well have been arranged to make it appear that subject had not cooperated with the KGB.

The material submitted by NY indicated that subject reported to NY concerning the recruitment approach made to him but apparently did not admit furnishing information or assisting KGB. It is requested, therefore, that NY forward to WFO the complete results of contacts between subject and the NY office since the subject's initial travel to the USSR. WFO desires to review this material in detail before making contact with the subject and decide whether or not to use him as a source against Soviets assigned to the Embassy in Washington, D. C.

SUBJECT:
Re NY let 9/19/68.

In order to better assess information provided by the subject to interviewing agents in New York on 9/13/68, Legat made certain discreet inquiries of close contacts who were acquainted with the subject during his stay in Hong Kong.

the United States Information Service in Hong Kong, related that he was certain that the only reason for the subject's departure from Hong Kong was that ABC was cutting back and felt that there was not sufficient coverage to be afforded this area by them to warrant keeping a man based here. stated that he took ABC's lack of providing a replacement for the subject as further evidence that it was only for business reasons that he was transferred from Hong Kong.

of Special Branch, Hong Kong Police, is known by Legat to have quarreled with the subject over SB refusal to brief newsmen on the Hong Kong internal situation during the period of communist uprisings in Hong Kong. however, advised Legat on 12/4/68 that he respected the subject's integrity and had never considered him a security risk.

The foregoing is for information of the Bureau, New York and WFO to assist in evaluation of future contact.

SUBJECT: CONF. INFT.

DATE: 9/19/68

Captioned individual was interviewed on 9/13/68,
by SAS EDWARD F. GAMBER and BERNARD J. FITZGERALD. At
this time, he advised that he was recalled from his
assignment as a Correspondent for the American Broadcasting
Company (ABC) in Hong Kong and would be re-assigned as a
general correspondent in either New York or WDC.

During interview, this informant advised that
while in Hong Kong, he associated with both Russian and
Chinese individuals and was acquainted with SA DANIEL
GROVES, Legat in Hong Kong, and JACK STINT, a CIA representative
in Hong Kong.

advised that he and his wife
visited the Soviet ship "Bikal" on 4 or 5 occasions while
it was in Hong Kong and they entertained 2 Russian engineers
by the name of_F.\GOURIEV and PAVEL\ADMITRIEV on one occasion
in their home after having met them aboard the Russian ship.

further advised that he and
Chief of the Special Branch, Hong Kong Police,
never saw eye-to-eye. He also said that TED COWAN of
British Intelligence, Special Branch, in Hong Kong mentioned
to him that he was being recalled by ABC for security
reasons.

All of the above information came forth as was expressing his inability to understand why ABC had recalled him from Hong Kong. It was not possible to explore in depth the associations and activities of during his assignment in Hong Kong due to the short duration of the interview. However, this former informant expressed a continued willingness to cooperate with the Bureau to furnish information on a confidential basis.

On 9/17/68, telephonically advised that he would, in all probability, be assigned in WDC and that he would be going there during the latter part of that week. He also advised that while previously in WDC during the week of 9/9/68, he telephonically contacted OLEG KALUGIN (KGB employee) and VLADIMIR BOGACHEV (GRU employee), both of whom are Soviets of interest to WFO.

Depending upon the location at which is eventually assigned, it is believed that he should be further interviewed for the purpose of obtaining information of interest to the Bureau developed by him during the course of his assignment in Hong Kong, as well as for the purpose of evaluating his informant potential on a current basis. The Bureau and WFO will be advised when informant's new assignment becomes known. However, should WFO become aware of informant's presence in WDC and they desire to establish contact with him, this should be done UACB.

SA EDWARD F. GAMBER was interviewed on 11/2 - 3/67 by upon his return from Hong Kong for a three-week tour with other American Broadcasting Company foreign correspondents.

During the course of this interview, indicated that he has been in contact with SA DANIEL GROVE, Legat in Hong Kong and expressed a very high opinion of SA GROVE. He indicated that he intended to maintain contact with SA GROVE and assist him in any way possible.

Since is in contact with the Legat at Hong Kong, the NYO feels that the Security Flash Notice in the Identification Division should not be removed at this time.

DATE: 11/6/67

FROM: SAC, NEW YORK (134-3315) (ADM)

SUBJECT:

On 11/2 and 3/67, was interviewed by SA EDWARD F. GAMBER after he contacted the NYO. is currently in the US in connection with his employment as American Broadcasting Company correspondent in Hong Kong. At the time he contacted this office, he had been in the US for approximately 3 weeks on tour throughout the US with other American Broadcasting Company (ABC) foreign correspondents. He was to spend very few days in NYC and expected to be returning to Hong Kong on 11/4/67.

said that he has been in contact with SA DANIEL GROVE, Legat in Hong Kong, and has found GROVE to be a very capable, efficient and pleasant person to deal with. Over the years, has always compared the Bureau and its employees with CIA and its employees. In the case of SA GROVE, made a comparison with employees of CIA with whom he is acquainted in Hong Kong and in the opinion of this former informant, GROVE is heads and shoulders above any of CIA's representatives in Hong Kong. said that in his opinion, GROVE had established excellent relations with many people in Hong Kong, and GROVE is apparently respected in the position he holds there.

again expressed his very definite preference for dealing with the Bureau rather than CIA in furnishing any information which might come to his attention in the course of his activities in behalf of the American Broadcasting Company.

Although had some brief contact with Soviet nationals in the NYC area during a visit to the United Nations and the Tass News Agency offices, his contacts were very brief and did not result in his obtaining any information of unusual interest.

SOURCE OF INFORMATION

Reurlet 8-29-66.

It will be permissible for you to establish contact with Jaffe; however, you should be most discreet and circumspect in your dealings with him.

For your information, Jaffe has served in the past as a double agent for the FBI and reported to Agents in the New York Office. He previously reported that the KGB very probably attempted to recruit him late in 1902.

Jaffe has been employed in the news media field and has worked for International News Service, the United Nations Secretariat, Time, Inc., as a researcher for "Life" magazine, "The Nation" and for the Columbia Broadcasting System prior to his employment with the American Broadcasting Company. He was formerly the ABC representative in Moscow but he was expelled from Russia in October, 1965, reportedly due to a report emanating from ADC indicating that a power struggle in the Kremlin might result in a shake up of the Soviet leadership.

Jaffe has had numerous contacts with Soviet officials in the past; however, he has reported his activities to this Bureau. He was last contacted by Agents of the New York Office on 12-2-65.

For the information of the New York Office, one copy of referenced Legat letter is attached.

He apparently did return to NYC but was involved in participation on the American Broadcasting Corp.'s year end news show, which involved travel on the part of informant in a group of ABC correspondents throughout the U.S. Several phone calls have been made to the American Broadcasting Corp. in an effort to contact this former informant, but on each occasion he was found not to be in NYC. It is known that he was in Washington, D.C. over the weekend of 1/15-16/66 and presumably he is now enroute to his new assignment in Hong Kong. When last contacted, he advised that he would have to proceed to Hong Kong during the latter part of January 1966 and presumably would not be back in the NYC area for approximately one year.

In view of assignment overseas and his past association with Soviet nationals, as well as his assignment in Moscow, (Security Flash Notice currently placed in the Identification Division will be continued for one more year. After thepassage of another year, the wisdom of continuing this Security Flash Notice will be evaluated.

# Russia's Changing, Says ABC Newsman

By Rick Friedman

A short while back, Sam Jaffe, American Broadcasting Company correspondent, was expelled from Moscow.

A short while from now, he'll be reporting for ABC out of Hong Kong with hopes of getting into Red China.

But for the moment, he's in the United States between assignments, looking back on his past four years in the Soviet Union.

Newsman Jaffe made news this past Fall when he was asked to leave Russia because John Scali, ABC diplomatic correspondent in Washington, had reported an imminent shake-up in the Russian hierarchy. Russia responded by sending Jaffe home and by cancelling a visa for George Watson, who was to replace him.

Sam had already been scheduled to leave Moscow on Dec. 1 for a vacation in the United States before his Hong Kong assignment.

ABC had both a Russian translator and a Russian cameraman working in the Moscow bureau. The network was told it could keep both of them on the payroll and keep their rented apartment in the city.

"They didn't kick out the network," Sam explained. "They asked me to leave; they wouldn't let George Watson in. But they gave ABC the impression we might be allowed to put a news correspondent back in Moscow in anywhere from three to six months."

Changes for Better

Looking back over the past four years, Sam Jaffe said Moscow changed in that time. "Maybe not as quickly as we'd like it to," he added. "But for the better."

"Today, the people know more about the outside world than they did four years ago. The Soviets are no longer jamming the Voice of America or the Russian-language beamings of the British Broadcasting Company. But Radio Liberty is still being jammed."

"There was nothing in the newspaper about my expulsion. But the customs officer at the airport knew all about it. He heard the news on the Voice of America"

"More and more, the Soviet citizens, particularly the students you make friends with, tell you what's going on."

"You see more criticism of the Soviet Union. Young people write in to the newspaper complaining about the lack of consumer goods and their letters are printed. The press itself gets critical of aspects of the government."

Sam said that there was no 'direct censorship of printed material written by foreign correspondents. But permission was still needed for shooting television film. And undeveloped photographs couldn't leave the country. They make you develop them there and they screen them," Sam said.

He added that Russia was letting more and more foreign cameramen in to work for the networks.

January 15, 1966

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 385

Also, that the Soviet news- men are befriending American newsmen. "Many of our tips come from them," Sam went on. "In some cases, of course, the tips are deliberately planted by the government itself. "We didn't feel any tightening of restrictions because of the Viet Nam crisis even though we got the official propaganda line about the United States being the aggressor in Asia." Sam said the Soviets were pretty good about letting for- eign newsmen travel around the country. But the new leaders I didn't travel as much as the ousted premier, Nikita Khru- shchev, and generated less copy.

Knew Nikita

Sam spoke wistfully of the days when he covered Khru- shchev, whom the ABC corge- spondent got to know well. On one occasion, Khrushchev singled him out at an Austrian Embassy reception in Moscow. 'The Russian leader called Jaffe out of a crowd of diplomats and raised his glass in a toast to the newsman. Noticing that Jaffe's glass was empty, Khrushchev filled it from his own, raised his glass again and said: "My best wishes to you." It was Jaffe who later scored a world newsbeat on the ouster of Khrushchev, communicating the news by a cryptic Moscow- to-New York telephone call to ABC. "Brezhnev and Kosygin, the new leaders, play it close to the vest," Sam said. "After Khru- shchev's fall, Moscow was a'lot, Muller for us

"Khrushchev was good сору. He talked off the top of his head. But Brezhnov and Kosygin are more sophisticated and they don't talk much. So it takes more time to get stories on what the government is up to."

Knows Far East

The 36-year-old Jaffe is lock- ing forward to his new assign- ment in the Far East, an area he knows well. As a 15-year-old Merchant seaman during World War II, he sailed the South Pacific. After the war, he spent four months roaming Japan. Back in the United States, Sam studied Far Eastern Af- fairs at the University of Cali- fornia in Berkeley, then worked a year in San Francisco as reporter-rewrite man for Inter- national News Service. While there, he was dramatized on television's "The Big Story" for solving a murder. When the Korean War broke out, Sam went into the Marings as a combat correspondent. Following Korea, he became a staffer for Life magazine and researched the religions of Asia for a series called "The World's Great Religions."

Sam made another swing through Asia in 1955 for the Nation magazine, covering the Asian-African Conference in Indonesia. It was there he got an exclusive interview with Chou En-Lai, the first given a western correspondent since the Chinese Revolution. Later, Jaffe was one of 18 newsmen invited to visit Com munist China. The trip was called off because of, opposition to it from the U.S. government. I'd still like to get into Red China," Sam said. "When I interviewed Chou, the Chinese were worried I would editorial- ize. I used a question-and-an- swer format and they were sur- prised and pleased that I didn't editorialize.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 386

"They asked me what they could do for me. I answered that I wanted to go to Red China. They told me to wait because they weren't ready yet."

Sam Jaffe joined ABC in September, 1961, and was appointed Moscow correspondent in November of that year.

Previous to ABC, he spent six years with the Columbia Broadcasting Company, covering such stories as the Moscow trial of Francis Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot; the first attempted coup d'etat of Nasser; and the kidnapping of the Weinberger baby in New York.

In June, 1963, Sam married Elizabeth Jeune Georgeson of New Zealand in Moscow's Palace of Marriages. A daughter, Deborah, was born in Moscow in March, 1965.

On January 16, 1966, a confidential source, who has furnished reliable information in the past, learned that Sam Jaffe of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) was in contact with Oleg D. Kalugin. According to the source, Jaffe related that he spent the weekend in Washington, D. C., having come down from New York City for a breakfast engagement with Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Jaffe said that Rusk was away and he was, therefore, represented by Under Secretary of State George Ball.

Jaffe advised Kalugin that he would return to New York City on January 17, 1906, but that he would return to Washington, D. C., on either Wednesday, January 19, 1966, or Thursday, January 20, 1966, indicating he would pass through on his way to California. Kalugin suggested they get together for lunch at that time, and Jaffe said he would let Kalugin know when he is available.

The source advised that Jaffe inquired as to the chances of ABC getting back there, which the source interpreted as referring to the Soviets issuing a visa to an ABC correspondent, and Kalugin replied that they would discuss it at the luncheon engagement.

The November, 1965, issue of the "Diplomatic List," published by the United States Department of State (USDS), lists Oleg D. Kalugin as a Second Secretary (Press), Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Washington, D. C.

Efforts are being made to arrange for further interview of however, it should be noted that there is no pending specific investigative matter of an important nature concerning which he should be interviewed which has come to the attention of this office.

This former informant did talk at some length concerning his expulsion from the Soviet Union. He pointed out that he advised officials of ABC in NYC on a number of occasions that ABC's Washington Diplomatic Correspondent JOHN SCALI was in error when he predicted a shake-up of the Soviet leadership as a result of a power struggle in the Kremlin. He said that when he received notice of his expulsion from the Soviet Union, he found that the Soviets were almost apologetic as far as he was concerned and in a contact with

RES: IRVING KAHN

CONFIDENTIAL

In August, 1964, Kahn told Kazakevich that Sterling Spero probably would not meet him in Moscow. Spero had a heart attack in Berlin and planned to return to New York. Kahn indicated that Phil Baum had told him that he had enjoyed his visit with Kazakovich. In November, 1964, Kahn informed Kazakevich that he had visited Sterling Spero in the hospital in Berlin. Spero was then better and back in New York. -C-

During the contact in June, 1964, subject wanted to know whether Kazakevich ever saw his cousin, Sam Jaffee, representative of ABC-Paramount. In August, 1964, subject mentioned his cousin, Sam Jaffee, again stating that Jaffee represented WABC in Moscow. He wished that Kazakevich could visit Jaffee. Kahn told Kazakevich that Jaffee is married to a young girl from New Zealand and resides in Moscow. -C-

Sam Jaffee is undoubtedly identical with Samuel Jaffee, subject of unfile 134-3315. -C-

During a contact in August, 1964, Kahn answered what was believed to be a previous inquiry from Kazakevich regarding on unidentified individual.

In November, 1964, Kahn reported to Kazakevich regarding the trip he and his wife, Ruth, had to Europe with a group of financial analysts. They flew to London, Brussels, Dusseldorf, Berlin, Frankfurt, Vienna, Madrid, Paris, and Amsterdam and spent about a month visiting corporate managements and meeting with bankers. -C-

Kahn told Kazakevich in June, 1964, that American impressions of Russia were improving but the Russians would get good out of a large exchange of visitors. In August, 1964, Kahn urged the Russians to let the Soviets travel to the U.S. He thought such travel would result in obtaining good will and the visitors could persuade influential Americans that the U.S.S.R. does not want to widen their borders or to make other countries accept communism. -C-

Kahn assured Kazakevich that the Soviets could call upon the U.S. to repeat the material help and military aid given during World War II if they needed help against aggressor eastern nations. Kahn indicated that he had "long felt" that the U.S.S.R. had no plans for military conquest. -C-

SCALI advised that GEORGE WATSON, an ABC News Correspondent, was scheduled to begin an assignment in Moscow, USSR, 11/1/65. He said that in connection with this forth- coming assignment, WATSON had some contact with the Soviet Embassy and had met BOBRAKOV a couple of times. He said that BOBRAKOV indicated to WATSON that he was interested in meeting some other member of the ABC Staff, and, in particular, was interested in meeting SCALI. Consequently, SCALI, WATSON, and EOBRAKOV met for lunch at Paul Young's Restaurant, Washington, D. C., on 9/21/65. SCALI said that for the first ten minutes or so BOBRAKOV directed his conversation to WATSON, whom he had met before and who was scheduled to go to Moscow.

Thereafter, BOBRAKOV engaged in conversation with SCALI, SCALI said, that aside from the points mentioned in the enclosed LAM concerning MLF and the danger of Germany's obtaining nuclear weapons, EOBRAZOV seemed merely to be scouting him or sizing bin up during the lunch. SCALI could not detect any effort on BOBRAKOV's part to seek any particular type of information, SCALI caid he pointed out to BODRAKOV the unusual situation in which the United States and the Soviet Union find themselves on the same side at the U. N. Security Council, endeavoring to koep the peace. SCALI pointed out to BODRAKOV that this seems to him to be a rather historic monent. ECALI thought BOBRAKOV might pursue this matter further and enter into a discussion of Red China, but he did not do so.

In their discussion of BOBRAKOV's wife's paintings, SCALI suggested to BODRAKOV that his wife might stage a show of her own in which she would exhibit those paintings by a Soviet artist painting in the U. S. BOBRAKOV replied that his wife might do so and suggested that possibly SCALI should see some of his wife's paintings. SCALI told BOBRAKOV he would be very happy to see then.

In discussing BOBRAKOV's lack of humor, SCALI men- tioned that at PAUL YOUNG's, where they wore having lunch, thore are bulletins of stock market quocations on each table, and SCALI made a jocular remark to BORRAKOV to the effect that this had been arranged in BOBRAKOV's honor. DOBRAKOV

asked SCALI and WATSON whether they owned stock, and in the onsuing conversation, SCALI remarked that he would like to buy some stock in Soviet industries, but only in those industries in which the profit motive is now being introduced. DOBRAKOV, according to SCALI, immediately responded that there has always been a use of the profit motive in the Soviet Union, and proceeded to engage in serious conversation on this point.

SCALI mentioned that when he happened to see DOBRAKOV again on the evening of 9/21/65, at the celebration at the Czech Embassy, he noticed that DOBRAKOV seemed to know quite a number of American reporters, including BERNARD GWERTZHAN of the Washington Evening Star and FRANCIS LARA of Agence France-Presse.

SCALI also stated that several months ago, he had lunch with ALEKSANDR I. ZINCHUK (Counselor, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C.), on which occasion they engaged in conversation of a general nature. SCALI said he initiated at this lunch contact with ZINCHUK inasmuch as he had found he was missing details of some news stories because of the limitation of his contacts with Soviet representatives.

SCALI was requested to advise WFO in the event he is contacted by the Soviets in the future.

In connection with the above information from SCALI to the effect that GEORGE WATSON was scheduled to begin his assignment for ADC in Moscow on 11/1/65, it is noted that advised on 9/27/65, that GEORGE WATSON had been told that word had been received from Moscow that WATSON'S visa was cancelled. The informant did not know the reason for this cancellation.

advised on 9/27/65, that he had learned that WATSON was considerably upset by the cancellation of his visa and was endeavoring to ascertain the reason. It was the informant's understanding that WATSON's visa had been approved for some time and that WATSON's belongings had been prepared for shipment to Moscow. The informant stated that WATSON had not yet succeeded in ascertaining from the Soviet Counsular

Office or the Soviet Embassy Press Office what the reason was, but that BORIS N. SEDOV (a Second Secretary in the Soviet Embassy Press Office) reportedly suggested the possibility that it might have something to do with some "bad thing" which SAM JAFFE did in Moscow.

In connection with the above, it is noted that the 9/20/65 issue of "Newsweek" on page 90 contained an article captioned "Covering the USSR" which described difficulties encountered by American television crews making films in the Soviet Union. The article stated in part that the situation had improved vastly since 1963, but that "Russian fear of the Expose still occasionally approaches the ludicrous. ADC's SAM JAFFE had a lengthy argument with officials who wanted to cut a scene in a film about Soviet women because one mother had a bookcase containing a book titled "To a Better Life." The woman's life, the Sovieté insisted, 'was alright as it was."

The same "Newsweek" article stated that American television companies operating in the USSR had to pay fees for "assistants" who were often superfluous advisers, and that "fees" for hiring equipment and crews making a film and retaining exclusive distribution rights can run into big money. The article stated that "ADC's JAFFE says Russian 'assistance' in covering the Soviet-American track meet this summer cost the network more than $12,000...."

Further in connection with the above-mentioned cancellation of WATSON's visa, it is noted that the Washington Post for 10/3/65, contained a radio-television column by LAVRENCE LAURANT captioned "Gotting Doots from Soviets is Fashionable for Networks," in which LAURENT stated that SAM JAFFE of ABC had been told that he was no longer welcomo in Moscow. LAURENT's column stated in part "What did JAFFE do? He was adjudged guilty of a report delivered Soptember 15, from Washington, by AEC Nowa Diplomatic Correspondent, JOHN SCALI. JOM had reported that a shake up was expected in the Soviet hierarchy.

The August, 1965, "Diplomatic List" lists Yuri I. Bobrakov as a Second Secretary, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D. C.

A Confidential Source advised on September 22, 1965, that on the preceding day, he had met with Bobrakov and engaged in conversation with him. Source stated that Bobrakov seemed mainly to be interested in getting across the idea that the proposed Multilateral Force (MLF) is a bad idea and is a stumbling block which is holding up agreement at Geneva on disarmament. He said further that Bobrakov expressed considerable concern over the danger of Germany's obtaining nuclear weapons. The Source said he pointed out to Bobrakov the unusual situation in which the United States and the Soviet Union currently found themselves on the same side at the United Nations Security Council, endeavoring to keep the peace.

Bobrakov, however, had no comment on this point.

Bobrakov told the Source that his wife is an artist, who now has about twenty of her own paintings, most of which she has done while in the United States.

In the opinion of the Source, Bobrakov is not very suave or adept at conversation and may be somewhat uncomfortable in dealing with Americans. Source also gained the impression that Bobrakov's sense of humor is almost nonexistent.

Source stated that Bobrakov attended a reception at the Embassy of Czechoslovakia on the evening of September 21, 1965.

In Moscow the Soviet government yesterday ordered American Broadcasting Co. correspondent Sam Jaffe (above) to leave because of what it termed false reports on the Soviet Union. This apparently referred to a report by ABC's Washington diplomatic correspondent, John Scali, saying that a power struggle in the Kremlin might result in a shake-up of the Soviet leadership. The Soviet Foreign Ministry reportedly indicated Jaffe would not have been expelled if ABC had carried the Ministry's denial of Scali's report.

Re:

(100-420694)

CONFIDENTIAL

Since it appears as if Charles Zomach was to travel to the U.S.S.R. and to contact his relatives there, San Francisco should conduct investigations of Charles Zomach and Mary St. John Zomach to determine whether they are engaged in activities inimical to the security of the United States. Investigation should include determination of their employment, whether they have access to classified data or restricted areas and whether they have traveled to the U.S.S.R. After investigation make recommendations regarding interviews. Results of investigations should be submitted in a form suitable for dissemination.

Los Angeles should reopen the case on Miriam Zomach to determine whether she has traveled to the U.S.S.R. recently and whether she is engaged in activities inimical to the security of the United States. Make recommendation regarding an interview. Submit results of investigation in a form suitable for dissemination.

San Francisco and Los Angeles should request Washington Field to check records of Central Intelligence Agency and Department of State regarding subjects.

The following additional information is submitted for your information in connection with these investigations.

CONFIDENTIAL

According to Miriam Coldina-Zemack (believed to be subject Miriam Goldina), while touring the U.S.S.R. in 1963, contacted Miriam Green of New York City and Rose Goris of Hollywood, California. During the contact with Goris, Goldina-Zemack mentioned that Sam Saffe's nephews -C- Sam Saffe, "works at ADC."

Due to lack of identifying date, it is impossible to determine whether Bufiles contain information identifiable with Miriam Green. Bufiles contain no record of Rose Goris-C-

Sam Saffe is believed to be identical with Samuel Charles Jaffes (NY file 100-100713, LA file 100-34525). Sam Saffe's nephew who works for ADC is believed to be identical with Samuel Adason Jaffee (NY file 331-3315). (100-376393;105-28333) -C-

Reference is made to New York letter to Bureau dated 9-13-60, copy of which was sent to Los Angeles, and Los Angeles letter to Bureau dated 10-20-60 mentioned
(LA file 100-60013), which contain information regarding Miriam Goldina. (100-410283-21,23) -C-

Bufiles reveal that the name of Miriam Goldina, 340 West 56th Street, New York City, Circle 6-0627, appeared in the 1955 and 1957 address books of William Arthur Voyce (NF file 105-11674), who was employed as a translator by the Antorg Trading Corporation, New York, New York, 1935-40. The case on Voyce was closed in 1960 by San Francisco when investigation failed to reveal additional derogatory information. -C- (105-50215-37)

One copy of this letter is being furnished to New York in view of their interest in Samuel Adason Jaffee. -C-

NOTE: Information taken from Xerox copies of additional information in Bufiles re Miriam Goldina has been sent to LA by Form 0-7. Investigation of Miriam Goldina (Zemach) and Charles Zemach was instigated in 1958 based upon information to effect Miriam Goldina had contacted Isidore Needleman re getting passport. At that time she admitted having been a member of cultural branch of CP twelve years ago and was worried regarding investigation to be conducted on her daughter-in-law. Investigations were closed when it was determined that neither her son nor daughter-in-law had access to classified information. Soviets are now undoubtedly aware of their employment and fact that they have relatives in USSR. Laboratory has advised that they have no knowledge regarding powders mentioned in correspondence. -C-

LUIS ALBERTO CONDOM CAJIGAL, who furnished information set forth in the letterhead memorandum, also advised that he worked with CIA in Havana from the beginning of 1960 to November, 1960, through EMILIO FERNANDEZ, a U.S. citizen. [^5]

CONDOM also advised that ALVARO FERNANDEZ FOX, who was also interviewed in this matter, is the nephew of MARTIN FOX, former owner of the Tropicana Nightclub in Havana, Cuba. CONDOM believes that since coming to Miami from Mexico City, ALVARO FERNANDEZ has become involved in the bolita racket inasmuch as his uncle is supposed to be a bolita racketeer in Miami. It is noted that when interviewed, ALVARO FERNANDEZ stated that he is unemployed and lives from money furnished him by his uncle, MARTIN FOX, and another uncle, PEDRO FOX, also residing in Miami at 302 Southwest Beacom Boulevard.

ALVARO FERNANDEZ, in addition to the information set forth in the enclosed letterhead memorandum, advised that while he was in Mexico City he worked as an informant for STEVE MINAS, U.S. Customs representative, U.S. Embassy, telephone 46-94-00, Extension 373, or home phone 48-02-50. He also advised that he was to contact Customs Agent ED FICKIE in Miami at FR 7-3571, which he did; however, FERNANDEZ has not been used by FICKIE in the Miami area.

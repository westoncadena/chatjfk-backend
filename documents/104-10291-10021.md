MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE OF: KENT, William

FROM: Office of the Personnel Director

1. On 6 June 1952 this office arranged with *National Selective Service Headquarters* to have the above-named subject's active duty orders cancelled.

2. Should the subject resign or otherwise be separated from CIA, please notify this office immediately in order that this cancellation action may be revoked and the subject will be made a free agent.

![signature of GEORGE E. MELCON]

to add multiple lines to a single table cell.  I am not sure if this is the proper way of doing it or if the bot is just not doing it correctly.  I need this verified.  Also the bot seems to be getting the OCR text from the image and adding a few additional letters to it.  for example on row 5, Column 7 it's picking up the two letters 'si' which are not there in the image.  Lastly, the text in row 6, last column, is '06/19/66' not '06/19/60', the zero is actually the letter 'O'.  I need that fix.  Can you help me with these edits?  Thank you.  :)!

REFERENCE: DIRECTOR 294821

1.  Being forwarded USC are copies of the QRPHONE/1 training
    report, the JEMINIMUM evaluation, contact reports of meetings with
    QRPHONE/1, a WOGEAR review of QRPHONE/1's book and some notes made
    by the STFLIMFLAM Headquarters officer, Harvey B. DAITCHMAN (IDEN),
    after his meetings with QRPHONE/1. These are for the information
    of both LCPIPIT and London Station and, taken together, should give
    you both the flavor of the variety of measures taken to assess the
    operational potential of QRPHONE/1.

2.  During PAUPEROS' TDY at Headquarters ve discussed the
    necessity of having QRPHONE/1 undergo an intensive seven day
    STFLIMFLAM training program to be conducted by DAITCHMAN. It is
    our opinion that in order for this training to be of maximum
    benefit, QRPHONE/1 and DAITCHMAN ought to be ensconced in a
    safehouse facility which provides security, comfort and an
    atmosphere conducive to learning. It is important that the
    training be conducted in a locale which will allow QRPHONE to give
    his full attention without being disturbed by his multitude of
    business and social contacts. Therefore, we recommend that LCPIPIT
    rent a cottage or heach house away from London for the duration of
    the training cycle. In discussing this with QRPHONE, he readily
    agreed and indicated that there would be no difficulty in getting
    away from his family for as long as we thought necessary. He

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WOLIME

SUBJECT: Completion of Training Report for QAPHONE/1, Training Program "SHAM"

REFERENCE: Memo for Director of WOMOLD From Chief,
WOLIME ... dated 23 May 1972;
Subject: "Covert Training for QAPHONE/1"

1. QAPHONE/1 was trained covertly in New York from 22 June to 14 July 1972. There were sixteen sessions for a total of eighty seven training hours.

2. This was a happy reunion of trainee and instructor. Less than two years ago, PHONE was given three days of reports training (Please don Completion of Training Report dated 19 October 1970). Just as then, PHONE was totally engrossed in every training session from the moment of his arrival to the moment of his departure. Remembering that the instructor does not eat lunch, PHONE brought a sandwich with him daily and took this lunch while listening to the instructor. Thus, every minute of every day was made to count.

3. The only time lost was three hours for JIMMMIES and on the several phone calls he had to make daily to check for calls to his cover office, then follow up with calls to those persons who had called his office and had left messages to be called back. At the most, these calls took half an hour. On some days, they took far less.

4. His cover organization work took up a considerable portion, everyday, of his free time with the result that he could not do any casing to speak of for subsequent preparation of como plans for exercises. For example, told early on to prepare two dead drop case plans, he was not able to come up with anything till the last week - and then with only one written one and one that he revolved orally. As a result he had to be given time during the training day to write reports of his counter surveillance exercises and one of his agent developmental exercises. After one such exercise, asked if he wished to take time out during the training day to write his report he said: "No, tonight I will make time to write it." And he did. And it was a good report.

5. On each Sunday, he went out of town to visit his aged Grandmother. He used the travel time to read tradecraft books (he read seven altogether).

On Tuesday, July 4th, his publisher appointed him baby sitter for the publisher's team age son and there wasn't any hope of getting any casing song that day. At least one time, he continued that he did not go to bed till two that morning and as he had left the afternoon before, he had stated that he had meetings starting at four thirty that afternoon. With all that, he nevertheless was fully alert and attentive every minute of every training session.

6. In his developmental recruitment series of exercises, his instructor played the role of operations officer and a real dumb-dumb to him. In such circumstances, PHONE had to do all the thinking, all the planning, all the casing for meeting sites, all the analyzing, all the preparing and pointing for the recruitment. It was pure joy to watch this man, after each meeting and again before the next one, to go to work on the problem. He knew where he was, knew where he wanted to go, knew how to get there. When TELQUIST, during the critique at the end of the series of exercises said: "He did a beautiful job," PHONE had earned that accolade all by himself. The instructor's only contribution had been in the teaching of the subject of Agent Acquisition.

7. At this point, the instructor wishes to execute a low bow in the direction of TELQUIST. He played his agent role excellently well and made the exercise a meaningful one for PHONE. The three trips to Fou Lock by TELOUIST must have been very taxing, particularly in view of his immediately upcoming ZIN trip, but they were efforts well spent.

8. No man, of course, is perfect. Each has an Achilles heel, a weakness, or an all-too-human trait, at the very least. Our PHONE has his. He has a very quick mind. He knows it. And knowing it, he relies on it, counts on it. This, in turn, leads to a small failure in self-discipline. For example, told to write out his plan for the recruitment pitch, he came in with six words (maybe not that many) scratched on a 3 by 5 leaf torn out of his pocket notebook. He then proceeded, from these few words, to run off his plan without a single pause for an instant. It was as though he was reading a definition from a dictionary, so smoothly did his mind and thoughts run. He prepares everything in his mind, it appears, and does not like to write out things which he feels he should not have to write out. While it is great to have so facile a mind, a bit of discipline, to write out in full so important an act as a recruitment pitch, might one day save grief when an error would have been spotted had the entire plan been written out then looked over for possible flaws.

9. This small flaw, the instructor feels, accounts in considerable measure for PHONE's failure to bring in a written dead drop plan till the last days of the program. PHONE felt he could just as easily report orally. In fact, the other dead drop (he had been asked to do two) on which he reported orally, he discussed as though the paper was in front of him and he was reading from it. Nothing was missing -- area


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 5

Cancription, access, hours of availability, the opposition, pros and cons as to suitchility - it ins all there. He just didn't like to vrita cut that upon which he could report orally.

Just straight writing, including paragraphing. Mind and pen vere as one.

The instructor sets don this reluctents on our hero's part to write aut certain things, not to daterade him, but to alert desk end field officers that if they must have a certain report by a cartain tire, and thay wort it in writing, thay must be fira. For example, six nas Becond rooting in the developmatal series, the instructor aaide "I must have that report first thing in the caraing.

tall functions. “These are a typical New Yorker's habits. The Instructor,
elps & Has Ecarter, is guilty of the identical actions. We are highly
kinetic in car movements and as for looking both ways while crossing a
cross-way street, we follow the old Marine Corps adage: “There's always
a car E.O.D. This doesn't cut the word”. By sheerest coincidence, when
the Instructor was on his way to the safe-site to deliver the surveillance
team's report, he violated his own rule of looking both ways in crossing
a one-way street and was bowled over by a hippie on a loaded bike -
going the wrong way. Only the large heavy film case the instructor
was carrying kept him from being knocked flat.

15. Nevertheless, PRIME is now fully cognizant of the appearance
    that his actions create and will watch it in the future.

16. One last note on the counter surveillance exercises; He
    changes his positions well and he camouflaged his actions beautifully.

The instructor called the surveillance team for a quick
examples the instructor called the surveillance team for a quick
feedback on the first exercise and caught the man just as they returned
to their office. They got on different phones for a three way conversation.
They reported one incident as follows: “too rapid were PRIME's movements,
that time he met a friend of his, he hardly paused to speak with him,
just waved him off”. The second surveillance: “No, it didn't look like
that at all, to me. To me it looked like this Indian-looking person
stopped PRIME and asked him for directions and PRIME gave them and just
went about his business”. PRIME's own report, which he wrote up before
he learned about the two different interpretations of the incidents
“where I stopped a foreign-looking man, apparently Indian in origin
and asked him for the Museum which I know perfectly well is on 55th
Street. I turned around as he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted
the same man in the gray suit, now holding his hat in his hand”.

17. In the second exercise, there were two items of note: One,
    the team was surprised to note in PRIME's report that PRIME even had
    the name of the book that the surveillant picked by when he followed
    PRIME into a book store. Second, when the exercise was over, the team
    compared notes and decided that PRIME may have made two of them but
    could possibly have made the third man. The team captain, on reading
    PRIME's report, was stunned to see that PRIME had indeed made the third
    man also, but good.

18. PRIME had an elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop-
    mental acquisition series) with an instructor in the
    New York office. After relating the fine job that PRIME had done, the
    instructor's report concluded: “A first rate performance by PRIME, who's
    obviously been around -- both coverwise and for real”.

19. His choice of meeting places with his agent could not be
    faulted. For one, he chose an East Side restaurant (where diplomats,
    as Mr. Sneed held himself out to be, would properly be seen dining).

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Meeting with QRPHONE/1

1.  I met with QRPHONE/1 for much of the 12th of July
    and wearing two hats. Wo first went through the third phase
    of the training exercise in which I had been playing the role
    of an agent prospect whom he was to assess and recruit, and then
    later in the OTR safehouse I identified myself as the Headquarters
    officer responsible for his project. Incidentally, he did an
    excellent job in all three phases of the training exercise and
    did particularly well on the recruitment itself. QRPHONE/1 is
    clever, imaginativo, has an excellent grasp of this aspect of
    tradecraft and handled himself particularly well in a complex
    and changing training scenario.

2.  As the Headquarters staff officer responsible for his
    project, I described in dotail the reasons for the long, sorious
    look at his performance these last several months, the changing
    intelligence and operational requirenents we face, and the care-
    ful scrutiny he had been given as we began to map out new direc-
    tions for him, all of which ended with this advance four-week
    training program, testing, and evaluation and substantive
    briefings. He said he was a bit confused by the WOMUSE brief-
    ing of last week so I explained how that tied in with this evening's
    planned discussion on the China program.

3.  Ve discussed his itinerary, personal plans and the
    pacing of the next several months, all of which were clarified
    to his satisfaction.

a. He will be debriefed on 24 July at 1000 hours at
the OTR safesite in NYC following his return from the
operational trip around the country.

b. I will meet hin for the final operational briefing
session at 1000 hours on 26 July in the same OTR safesite.

c. Lo will depart New York the night of 26 July on the 8:00 p.m. TWA flight to London.

d. This will get him in London in time for a previously scheduled ops meeting with PAUPEROS on 27 July. He leaves on 1 August for a one-month vacation touring cost of Europe with his family and spending one week in Halta.

4. Before the arrival of DAITCHMAN we discussed other operational matters as follows:

a. His friend in New York City, Richard Ward, (Apt. 11K, 372 Central Park West) recontly returned from Hanoi and Paris with the manuscript of a new book written by Cambodian Prince Nordom Sihanouk titlod "My Var with CIA." Sihanouk gave the manuscript to Wilfred Burchett who gave it to a North Vietnamese friend to give to Ward. Ward was asked to find an American publisher and he, in turn, asked for CRPHONE/1's help. Burchett is an old friend of Ward's and stays at his apartment whenever he visits New York. The manuscript has already been given to a publisher in Europe. QRPHONE/1 asked if we would be interested in a copy. I told his to get one if he could do so without straining his cover.

b. His friend, Lyle Stuart, the publisher, has been trying to buy the American branch of the Oxford University Press, and apparently is about to consummate the deal. He offered QRPHONE a job as his European representative if the deal goes through.

c. Per TEUTSCHMAN request I asked QRPHONE to give his instructor a copy of the long list of names and organizations given to him by Sibecho. Also per Ken's request, and in answer to my question, ORPHONE said he received the magazine published by the Turkish party in Collards Book Shop in London.

5. From 5:00 p.m. until a little after midnight on 13 July, DALTCHWAN of FB Division briefed QRPHONE/1 in substance on the STFLIMFLAN program, our interest in having QRPHONE/1 pursue such a role, and explained the great amount of dreary work that would be involved in learning the communist dialectic thoroughly if the whole venture were to be successful. I will make no effort to condense these seven hours

of ethereal discourse, but QRPHONE was fascinated, captivated by it and clearly interested Ay pursuing that long murky path to "enlightenmont." D did an outstanding job in setting the stage, describing the target, and then explaining step by step how he and CRPHONE/1 and PAUPEROS would work together as the operation professed. Regarding QRPHONE'S upcoming trip in the U.S.D explained exactly how CHPHONE should act as he meets each of his friends and how he should develop his new-found "interest" in studying Marxist-Leninism as he nests with those various people. QRPHONE was very responsive, took notes, had ideas of his own, but more importantlyTravery appreciative of the tactical advice that / described. QRPHONE/1 will meet the following people over the next ten days.

a. Richard Ward in New York City.

b. Libel Bergman in Newark (on three different occasions)

c. Benjamin Blake, Hilton Henry and a fellow :named Boggs in Dotroit (he's with NAR).

d. Don Wright, Herb Block, and Sidnoy Lens all in Chicago.

e. LPWEAKLY/1 and family in Chicago

f. Davida Fineman and Saul Landau in San Francisco.

g. The Martin Luther King Foundation in Atlanta.

6. All of the above were carefully chosen because of who they were, what organization or philosophy they repro- sented, or their interest in the Chinese, and the extent to which the whole would knit together and form a viable base which QRPHONE can use as a springboard when he returns to London. PATTUrged QRPHONE to join, or in some cases rejoin, DATTCHE Haoist study groups in London including the one conducted by Manchanda. The role that QRPHONE should play with these groups, as well as others in Europe who wero singled out during various parts of the conversation, was also spelled out in detail. By the end of the evening CRPHONE had clearly in mind what it was all about, what he should do next and the purpose of our reconvening on the 24th and 26th to decide finally what it all amounts to.

7. I asked ORPHONE to call on the sterile line using the "Mr. Stanley" indicator on Monday afternoon, 21 July. This is simply to check in and let us know he is on the way and how things havo come thus far. He calculated that ho needed another $500.00 for the U.S. portion of his overall trip since LCPIPIT apparently had not anticipated this when he was given his original advance. I arrangod through the good offices of in New York to get $500.00 to QRPHONE today.

8. QRPHONE asked if we had any intelligence requirements for his to pursue while he is in Malta. I said Kon would brief him on those requirements on the 24th of July if we had any. Incidentally, QRPHONE mentioned that Libol Bergman comes to New York City overy Thursday and told QRPHONE that he could be reached on telephone number 265-2500. ORPHONE said if we cared to we might want to track that number and see where Berguan hangs out.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Final Contact with QRPHONE/1 in New York City

1.  As arranged previously, I met with QRPHONE/1 at the WOMOLD safesite in New York City from 1000 hours to 1230 26 July. The meeting was intended to wrap up loose ends, convey our decision to pursue the STFLIMFLAM program (providing QRPHONE/1 himself was amenable), and to make clear that we expect measurable operational progress within the next year.

2.  Although QRPHONE/1 had been debriefed on 24 July by other Headquarters officers regarding his trip around WOCORK, I asked him to review it again for my information so I could put it clearly in perspective as it related to our plans for him in the coming year. I'll not bother with the details here because such have already been written for the record elsewhere, but suffice it to say that QRPHONE/1 was both pleased and relieved at the reception he got from his old contacts because of the reflection these receptions had on his own bona fides. The allegations of his BKTRUST affiliation which had floated through Europe were never mentioned by his WOCORK contacts; on the contrary at least one of them urged QRPHONE/1 to return soon to WOCORK because this is where the action is. This same individual gave QRPHONE reading materials on the Communist dialectic and urged him to study them closely. This greatly impressed QRPHONE because it showed how accurate were the briefings given him by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAN officer and demonstrated that we knew our tactics.

3.  I then reviewed with QRPHONE/1 the reasons for our long close scrutiny of him and his performance these last several months followed by our selection of him for advance training, testing, and redirection in the strong hope we had that he would accept this new task because of its priority importance to our national collection requirements. I asked

SECRE

QRPHONE/1 his impressions of it all, his reaction to the STYLIMFLAM proposal, and whether he would accept its demanding obligations. QRPHONE said he certainly would and that he found it a real challenge to his intellect and his operational skills. The tedious study of the dialectic would not deter him. His only concern was how he should actually play it as he developed relationships with appropriate party members and, ultimately, the Chinese in SMORANGE. I pointed out he needn't concern himself with the last point because that would be part of the purpose of the ten-day training program in SMORANGE in September which would be given him by the Headquarters STFLIMFLAM officer. I said the training would require total emersion for ten days straight, probably in some secluded beach house on the coast where all involved could reside full time. He said this would present no problem cover-vise; he would simply tell his family he had gone to the continent. I said that PAUPEROS would be working out the details of this with him, probably after his return from vacation.

4. I said that given QRPHONE/1's past performance, his credentials with the radical left, and his apparent interest in vigorously pursuing the STFLIMFLAM program we expected to be able to measure in six to eight months the likelihood of his being able to achieve all the STFLIMFLAM objectives based upon the progress he would have made by then with his Chicos contacts. Should it appear that the STFLINFLAM operation would not succeed we would be discussing alternative courses of action with him by the end of the year. He did say that of all the countries in Europe where his STFLIMFLAM and radical left potential is probably the best, Italy would be first and Denmark second.

5. I told QRPHONE/1 that his meeting with PAUPEROS had been moved to 31 July as he requested, reviewed his European vacation plans and his Halta trip and wished him the very best of luck. At this point QRPHONE/1 certainly seens willing and able aggressively to pursue our operational plans. We shall see.

# WOGEAR Review of African Liberation Movements

In general, the author has done a reasonably good job describing the Historical development of the various African liberation movements, especially when one considers the complexity and number of splits and mergers that have occurred within and among the movements over the years. There are several glaring inaccuracies, however, in the author's conclusions about the current position and effectiveness of the several Portuguese African liberation movements.

Regarding Angola, the author characterizes the MPLA as an ideologically-oriented group (1.e., Soviet doctrine) that has failed to grasp and utilize to its advantage the tribal realities that exist in Angola. The author fails to acknowledge, however, that the MPLA has had some success, albeit limited, in building a movement that is national and multiracial in character rather than tribally oriented. Despite its urban intellectual leadership, the MPLA has had some success winning local support in rural eastern Angola.

By contrast, GRAE ranks a poor second. From inception, its primary base of support has been the large Angolan refugee population of Bakongo tribesmen who live in southwestern Zaire. Although the organization has won some support among Bakongo kinsmen across the border in northwestern Angola, it has failed to broaden its base because of its thinly disguised regional and tribal make-up. Moreover, Roberto's unwillingness to delegate authority or compromise have produced chronic disputes at the leadership level. The author's conclusion that GRAE is a formidable force to be reckoned with in the future of Angola is contradicted by the fact that the MPLA is by far the largest and most effective of the three nationalist groups opposing the Portuguese in Angola.

MOZAMBIQUE

The present FRELIMO leadership does not appear to be in the state of disarray in 1972 that the author believes it is. Although some differences undoubtedly persist, the present leaders seem to have closed ranks somewhat since the departure of Simango in late 1969. For the present, any internal squabbles that may exist are not noticeably affecting FRELIMO's fighting abilities inside Mozambique.

The test scores were not as high as would be expected in comparison to his behavior and life style. The discrepancy could be due to the fact that he suffers from inferiority feelings and is working overtime to compensate. He gets considerable satisfaction and mileage out of his authorship; however, it takes a great deal of his energy in order to discipline himself enough to write a book. His talents are much more in the field of journalism. Mentally alert and very perceptive, he is aware of what is happening around him. These same traits would serve him well as an access agent. However, his reporting may reflect some distortions because his memory is not strong, and he tends to remember those events that are of interest to him. He naturally has good manual- manipulative skills, plus a practical bent that should enable him to easily and effectively learn and carry out tradecraft techniques.

Emotionally, Subject is fickle. "Out-of-sight - out of mind," describes the way he relates to others. The reason for this is that one of his primary needs is to be accepted and liked. Most of his life has been spent seeking acceptance, and because he is emotionally dependent he rapidly and intensely becomes involved. If separated from someone with whom he is involved, he has difficulty maintaining loyalty, and begins to look for another way to satisfy his needs.

An important fact which his case officer should remember is that he is not motivated by an ideology, but rather by the person who represents a particular ideology. His relationship with his case officer is of prime importance. To ensure his loyalty to the organization and consistent performance, he will need intense handling. The problem is that he may balk since he resists authority. He has the tendency to think that he knows it all, as witnessed by his never completing a degree.

ORPHONE/1

Subject is not by nature a role player, and it would not be operationally advantageous to have him switch roles, for he cannot psychologically handle role playing over a period of time. He has worked hard to establish an identity for himself, and could not cope as effectively with a new one.

Conclusion:

Subject is a bright, extremely ambitious, and aggressive individual who appears to be motivated to work for the Agency by three needs: 1) a need to be accepted and liked; 2) a materialistic need; and 3) as a vehicle to be vindictive to former loyalties, 1.e., the far left or radical movement in this country.

Though he is capable of switching loyalties, and his life history attests to this fact, it is very difficult to predict his future behavior since so much depends on his life circumstances. One statement that can be made is that, given his personality, it is very doubtful if he would return to his former allegiances. But if not personally involved with someone from this agency who can give him acceptance and support, he is likely to look elsewhere for his need satisfactions.

# Notes on QRPHONE by Harvey B. DAITCHMAN

1. Revolutionary Image: Discussed briefly how it is obtained. Pointed out there is a pattern to it which is discernable among revolutionaries. It is usually issue oriented in the beginning, the war being one of the key issues, and it gradually evolves into a desire to engage in practical activities which usually expressed best on a continuing basis through work in an organization. Also connected with this process is the gradual development of a different "outlook." It is usually a mixture of idealism and Marxism-Leninism-socialism-Mao Tse-tung thought. Usually unstructured but developing.

It is possible in this stage to move from one group to another without any particular approbation being attached for this transience. This is particularly so if one starts way outside a M-L-ist group and moves inward towards it. Quite a different thing to start in a M-List group and go out.

Also in development of a new outlook one comes to study a variety of revolutionary literature. This can take one into different areas, anarchism, GW advocacy, revolutionary nihilism, socialism, Marxist-Lenism, etc. However, to get to latter it must be done logically.

2. Tightly Structured Op: Emphasis upon tight, controlled contacts which seek to accomplish a specific purpose--collection of info not necessarily one nor always one. Purpose is to lay ground work for future developments. Purpose to establish certain contacts which can be later used in either positive or negative fashion. Structured conversation is also essential. It too should seek to accomplish something, directed so as to be useful to future development of op: e.g., desire to have an explanation for an action to be undertaken later--so bring up in conversation with someone so that can use that conversation later as explanation for interest in a subject, knowledge of a subject, etc. It is checkable.

3. Study: Most important aspect in opening phases of op. Without correct study and without development (understanding) of "correct outlook" one will always be a dilettante to the, outside looking in, someone who is useful to them "under certain conditions," but not someone who is reliable, and not a dependable revolutionary. This is really the key, the ideological tool, it will open doors that cannot otherwise be entered.

4. Contacts: Those to be exploited now and those to be used in or for future time. In the beginning the contacts which are developed are to be used as a means of building his justification for having begun the _serious_ study of Marx,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 18

Lenin, and Mao. This must be discussed with people so that many
are aware of it. These conversations will be later used when he
explains how and why and when he became interested.

5. Diffuse Nature of Op: In beginning op has a diffuse
   nature. It is necessary to make many contacts. Some will be
   more useful than others, but all have potential for use in
   one circumstance or another. Since we have no way of knowing
   how or from whom the Chinese collect their intelligence, seek
   out, or otherwise spot budding revolutionaries we can assume
   that some one of his acquaintances will report his interest
   in Mao, etc. We can assume that through some of his activities
   Chinese will build up his dossier so that at a later date when
   we go directly to the Chinese for help they can look in their
   dossier and see that x number of months ago, etc., various
   things were reported. Etc.

6. Ops as a Process of Development: Permit no diversions
   or detours which might become permanent. This would include
   targets of opportunity, etc. Must always maintain correct
   operational line and cannot reach target by following various
   diversionary tributaries in the temporary interest of collecting
   marginal intelligence. Must be prepared to sacfrice diversionary
   tasks in pursuit of main goal or objective. If tangential
   things are folled up we then have a different op, and a new op
   line, must be cautious with this. Ops line serves as guide for
   whole op from beginning to end.

7. Tactics in Op: Must always be carefully thought out so
   as to insure forward development of op. Something must be seen
   emerging or useful, or having potential future value for develop-
   ment of op, otherwise it is pointless to undertake it. Tactics
   are details. Details are most important aspect in day to day
   running of op. They must be paid attention to, must be contrib-
   utory, must be carried out in correct sequence, and we must keep
   in mind that at one or more points it is these details which will
   be subject of the scrutiny of the opposition. IT IS IMPORTANT
   THAT THESE DETAILS APPEAR LOGICAL TO THIS OPPOSITION, even if they
   may seem illogical to us at times. Our logic is not the same as
   communist logic.

8. Ops is Step by Step Process: Op should/or can be
   divided into steps, phases, stages, segments, whatever. Each
   phase should dovetail into the next. To some extent a general
   outline can be developed. Each of the major phases should
   be sub-divided into stages so that they can be dealt with step
   by step. For example: Three broad categories:

1st Phase: All initiatives are ours. We do all the work,
lay ground for future stages. We have a flexible line which
permits making maximum contacts to be correctly exploited. We
give training. Also devise concrete activities for him to carry
out.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 19

2nd Phase: Chinese and others have shown interest. We
will exploit this interest. After he has completed first phase
we will begin to make structured contacts with the Chinese. In
these contacts he will show that he has a grasp of the ideology,
is interested in learning more, desires to study more intensively.
Will use as negative examples: his book, Panthers, some aspects
of Bergman's behavior, the unstructured and undisciplined nature
of most revolutionary activists in U.S., particularly among the
blacks, or whatever may seem appropriate at time contact is
made. However, will seek their help to further his study and
will indicate recognition of need to return to U.S. in order
to undertake correct role in revolutionary struggle. At this
stage we will have an idea of interest of Chinese. We will be
able to determine whether we can expect progress or not. If
they prove willing to help they will then be asked to guide
his further study, to help him. Through this help they will
be able to see the development which has taken place. We should
get a good feeling of their willingness to guide him after a
couple of meetings. If we are shut out then must make ops
judgement from that point on--can always target against Soviets
and use Chinese as negative example. If they are interested
we will then lose some aspects of our initiative, but in essence
the more initiative we lose to them, the more they try to
direct him, the deeper he becomes involved with them, which is
our objective--one of them. He must continue his study.

3rd Phase: Continue his study; continue his contacts all
around, but by now should have significant contacts and can
dispense with the more general "sparrow" approach. Once certain
of their willingness to help we ask about a trip to Peking
to study after which he wants to return to U.S. and take active
role.

Recognize that this may be a sticking point. We don't
want him here. However, this idea has to always be in the
forefront as far as the Chinese are concerned otherwise they
have little reason to be interested in him. This MUST appear to
be his goal. We may be able to circumvent it later for one
reason or another, or it might be useful to bring him back
temporarily. This decision must be reserved for that time.

These stages and sub-stages must be further divided if
we are to understand the operation correctly and are to carry
it out correctly. Each action he is asked to undertake must
be seen leading to something concrete in the next or another
step. The whole op goes STEP BY STEP. We do not insert
unrealistic objectives, or those which would be desirable but
may be difficult. This is a waste of time. We only seek to
do what is possible--possible is what can be turned into reality.

Emphasis must be made on "step by step" approach and must
be maintained. Otherwise we can trip ourselves up by trying to
accomplish something which is out of sequence FOR THEM. For


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 20

example: He has read Marx and Lonin. We might say he's quite familiar with it. We could then say that he will read Mao and after that he will be able to pretend to be a Maoist. All of this is true. He could say it and act like he and others thought a Maoist should act. However, appearance and essence are not synonomous. It might appear to non-Maoists that our troop is a Maoist because he can talk as good a game as anyone else--or better than those who have not studied as Luch--but the essence of being a Maoist is not contained in such superficialities. Nor is the essence of being a Marxist-Leninist so contained. He cannot, for example, bloom or emerge as a Maoist and find acceptance with the Maoists. They know the process it takes to get there: "Several years of assiduous study can produce good results." (Some Chinese quote on studying Mao.)

9. Their Weapon is Also Our Tool: Once we understand correctly how they wield their weapon, the dialectical method, it can serve as our tool to pry our way into their camp. Through proper study and understanding we can devel op and promote Q's superiority among his friends and acquaintances. To Marxists he will be much more acceptable and his intel product will probably be enhanced since they will talk on subjects they might not have touched upon in the past, he will be more trusted, and also he will have better recognition of key developments in Marxist world through better understanding of their reality.

10. Some activities which we might consider enroute.

a. Start His Own Study Group: Chinese would be very interested. Unlike most study groups with which I am familiar he would stress study of ideology--in correct way. However, to prevent them from profiting from such study they can be tied in knots for months dealing with a variety of ideological problems. There is no point in our developing for their use good revolutionaries. However, it would provide reason for frequent contact with Chinese in order for them to help him in the development of his group. Would probably lead him into contact with other interesting types. Might have it for "Americans only" abroad--to avoid problems with Brits: whatever:

b. Might Talk About Starting a One Man Institute for Studying African Revolution: could put out a four page broad- sheet for peanuts. It would discuss various African problems. His book gives him good reason for such study. He might draw one or two people to him. Can use this too as basis for approach to Chinese. He will have come to recognize that he had not painted the true picture of national lib struggle in his book and through his broadsheet he seeks to rectify some his ideas.

c. He could seek to do another book on "The Dialectics of African Revolution." Here again the help of various communists, Marxist-Leninists, and particularly the Chinese in providing guidance (correct guidance) would give him frequent access and contact--providing the Chinese are willing to help.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 21

d. Start a Broadsheet for American Revolutionaries Abroad: This would give him contet with a wide variety of radical U.S. types abroad. It would also have feed back into the American scene and in part fulfill his requirement to have an active role with U.S. revolutionary developments. Etc.

Etc.

e. There are other activities which he might also undertake. The above are a few ideas of what we can do to "promote" QRPHONE. He can do a number of different things at the sametime since much of it overlaps and is hence com- patible. However, each must be structured, carefully handled, with great attention to the details. STEP BY STEP.

Some Words of Caution: Our experience clearly indicates that it is incorrect to rely upon either the agent or the station to provide the impetus. This seems to be true for a number of reasons. Case officers change often, chiefs of ops, bases, or stations change--there is not much continuity. We are thinking of a long term operation which, as it grows, becomes very complex. It is not easily understood by someone who gets involved after it has been going for sometime. It is even more true of changes in station leadership whose attitude is largely developed on his subjective feelings from reading only cable traffic. The initiative, the operational ideas, etc. are best kept in Hqs. There is so much more information here to work with, people with whom one can talk, staffs, etc. Also most officers in the field simply do not have the time to sit down and plan in the kind of detail that is needed to continue and develop the op. It calls for solid knowledge of the communist reality in order to insure that no errors creep in those contacts he may make. It calls for someone to have the time to read, study, certain publications, articles, etc., and then to figure out whether or not a given publication or article can be used to make a useful contact, write a useful letter, etc. If so, how, and then go the field with the idea, and concrete directions about how it should be used. Case officers most likely won't be exposed to the same material and probably wouldn't have the planning time necessary, or the various resources of Hqs to do what needs to be done.

This is not to suggest that the field has nothing to say. However, if the understanding can be clearly made that this is in fact a joint operation, with Hqs having an opportunity for big input, with the understanding that the only thing which matters to all concerned is the correct development of the operation in the given concrete conditions and not either the Hqs or the field trying to establish some kind of supremacy of rights over the other--there is a good chance of success.

# Agent Profile - QRPHONE/1

QRPHONE/1 is an American citizen and a singleton agent who has been a recruited asset for some seven years. He has extensive contacts among leftist, radical, and communist movements in Europe and Africa and was able to sustain his relations with many such figures for operational purposes in spite of a formal disassociation some years ago. Originally a member himself of a radical pro-communist group, his disenchantment with internal personal and political dissension in an organization to which he had firmly committed himself led later to his acceptance of an operational relationship with the Agency. Although targeted after his recruitment at the plethora of new left and radical elements in Europe, essentially for intelligence collection purposes, QRPHONE/1 has recently been redirected toward the Chinese Communists with a view to ingratiating himself and seeking their guidance and support as he demonstrates an interest in more effectively acting on their behalf. Our ultimate objective is to precipitate invitations to Mainland China which will lead to successively higher echelons of contact within the Chinese Government.

To prepare QRPHONE/1 for this demanding task, extensive retraining, assessment and remotivation were recently accomplished and selective recontact was made by him with his more influential and pertinent communist contacts. Reactions to QRPHONE/l's alleged desire to more fully commit himself to the communist Chinese cause and the assistance rendered thus far by these communist contacts are encouraging indicators of the potential success of this agent to achieve our goal.

Although a complex man to manage operationally because of his own background and the mix of his ideological and professional motivations, QRPHONE/l's intelligence ano personality are such as to well equip him to meet the - challenge of the tests the Chinese are likely to throw his way. He is based in England, as is his case officer, and operational meetings are held in secure safe sites, sometimes on the continent.

QRPHONE/1 has produced numerous intelligence reports on communist and radical targets in addition to his covert action functions as a journalist and author. His long-term tenure with the Agency will be determined in part by the degree of success of his new Chicon directions.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with QRPHONE/1

1.  On 24 July 1972, Andy Ness (in alias as Andy),
    Frank Falko (in alias as Frank) and the undersigned
    (in alias as Ken) converged on the OTR safesite in
    New York City to meet with QRPHONE/1 in order to debrief
    him on his trip through WOCORK.

2.  The discussion was started by having QRPHONE
    relate the details of his trip on a city by city basis
    describing the people he met and his reception by them.
    It should be noted here that several of the individuals
    that QRPHONE was to have seen were out of town or
    unavailable, however, QRPHONE will correspond with these
    individuals in order to maintain his relationship with
    them.

NEWARK

QRPHONE met with Leibel Bergman at his home
and stayed overnight (14-15 July) as his guest.
QRPHONE told Bergman that he had decided to make
a full-time commitment to the study of Marxist-
Leninist (M-L) doctrine in order to become more
proficient in M-L theory and would like to join
the RU to further this ambition. Bergman's reaction,
according to QRPHONE, was enthusiastic. Bergman
gave. QRPHONE some M-L literature (which was the
same as the literature Andy gave him several
weeks ago to study) which he felt would be helpful.
Bergman stated that if QRPHONE was really interested
in becoming involved in the M-L movement he should
return to WOCORK because that "was where all the
inconsistencies were." Bergman invited QRPHONE to

SECRET/RYBAT

take part in some M-L study groups but didn't say what exactly would be studied. The following are some general comments QRPHONE provided about Bergman. Bergman doesn't like Newark, he has been mugged several times and would like to go back to California; however, that is not possible at this time, so Bergman will instead move to New York City. Bergman is pleased with the current development of the RU. He said that the recent trip to China by several RU members was successful and that the trip had been pleasant for them. QRPHONE commented that it appears that Bergman does not have the same control of the RU that he formerly had, although he is regarded as the "guru" of the RU.

NEW YORK

QRPHONE said that Richard Ward is attempting to sell the English language rights of Prince Sihanouk's book My War With the CIA. Ward had been trying to get Lyle Stuart to purchase the rights but Stuart's antipathy toward Wilfred Burchett, "that old Communist" according to Stuart, was too great. Burchett apparently wrote the forward and Stuart doesn't want to publish anything with his name on it. QRPHONE, in our presence, called Stuart and convinced him to at least read the manuscript of the book before he turned it down. Ward has a South Vietnamese student living with him as a combination houseboy/companion. This student, whose name is David Truong, is the son of the South Vietnamese presidential candidate Truong Dinh Dzu, who ran in the 1967 South Vietnames election on a peace platform and who is now in prison. QRPHONE said that this student has amassed a large collection of books on intelligence, that the books are expensive and that he doesn't have any idea where the money to buy the books came from. He also said he doesn't think Truong has immigration papers to stay in WOCORK legally. I asked if Truong was in any way involved with the recent attempt to hijack a plane to Hanoi. QRPHONE stated that Truong knew the hijackers and might have known something about the attempted hijacking because the hijackers had also stayed at Ward's apartment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 26

# SECRET/RYBAT

Ward is going to France soon for a vacation with a girlfriend he refused to identify because he feels his apartment and phones are bugged "by at least ten intelligence agencies." Before he goes on vacation he intends to stop in Paris and meet with DRV and PRG officials as well as with Wilfred Burchett. (Ward also met with Jane Fonda prior to her recent trip to the DRV). Ward will try to visit QRPHONE in London sometime in September before he returns home. Ward claimed that a "wealthy benefactor" gave him some $1000 to cover the cost of his vacation. Ward himself is broke and makes only about $60 per week salary.

## DETROIT

QRPHONE was unable to see Milton Henry, leader of the New Republic of Africa, who was on vacation in Japan. He did manage to see FNU Boggs, who is apparently no longer involved with radical organizations but who is acting as a clearinghouse for black and white radicals. QRPHONE characterized Boggs as less doctrinaire and less dogmatic than he had been in the past. Boggs' feeling about the black radical movement is that it is in considerable disarray.

## CHICAGO

QRPHONE saw LPWEAKLY/1 who told him that he, was trying to get an invitation to visit China. LPWEAKLY/1 told QRPHONE that if he went he would see about taking him along. This was the first that QRPHONE knew about LPWEAKLY/1's plans. QRPHONE was unable to see either Sidney Lens or Hal Block because they were out of town. He did corroborate the fact that Block had recently been to China. QRPHONE spent some time with Don Wright, who was a member of the RU delegation to China. Wright is now a full-time RU official responsible for organizing RU cells in the Mid-West and seems committed to revolution although he doesn't speak in M-L terminology. Wright stated that one problem now facing the RU involves national exposure, i.e., getting minorities to become involved with the RU. This is a change from past RU philosophy which was that

[^1] SECRET/RYDAT


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 27

minority groups should form their own organizations separate from the RU. QRPHONE said Wright is very bitter toward the Black Panther movement and thinks that Eldridge Cleaver is "bad" and that Huey Newton and Bobby Seale are "corrupt".

## SAN FRANCISCO

In San Francisco QRPHONE stayed with Davida Fineman. The mysterious M, who appeared in several of her letters to QRPHONE, is Martin Nichols, a Marxist scholar of note who translated into the English the entire Fundamentals of Political Economy. He was once a member of the RU.

Emotionally, Davida is not as depressed as she was several months ago, even though her brief exposure to the world of labor union organizing was a failure. Her comments about the RU were to condemn the Bruce Franklin group (Venceramos Organization) which she said is going to bring disaster to the whole RU because of its predilection for violence before the groundwork for revolution has been laid. Fineman feels that Robert Avakian, a high RU official, is less wild and erratic than in the past and has in fact become a good M-L.

QRPHONE saw Paul Richards, Hodee Edwards' son-in-law. Richards is a former CP member from the Mid-West, which he left because of the people. He feels that the Mid-West is a part of the country where the Government ought to test nuclear warheads. QRPHONE also met with Earl and Lee Rose. Earl was in the RU delegation to China where he must have caused some embarrassment to the delegation by his naivete. He attempted to meet African revolutionaries, particularly members of the MPLA, which he didn't realize were Moscow-oriented. Rose asked QRPHONE to write and send him material on the various African liberation novements. Lee Rose works for Bell Telephone Company although Earl, her husband, is unemployed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 28

# SECRET//RYBAT

ATLANTA

QRPHONE went to the Martin Luther King Center for Social Change, formerly the Martin Luther King Foundation, where he met with Tom Porter, the head staffer of the organization. There was recently a split in the Center and the Executive Director, a Dr. Scott, was forced out of office. The office is still vacant and, according to Porter, will remain so for the immediate future. The reason for the continued vacancy is apparently to allow Coretta King and other members of the Board of Directors to maintain direct control. Porter is a former writer for Freedom Ways Magazine. QRPHONE said that Porter knew of him but didn't say exactly how. QRPHONE told Porter he would consider writing a brief on the Center for LPWEAKLY. QRPHONE said that the Center is going to establish a foreign affairs staff which will be headed by Jack O'Dell, an old CP member.

3. After QRPHONE's discourse on his trip, Andy discussed in broad terms what he could expect in the next year with regard to securing entre to the Chinese. QRPHONE was told that once he was proficient in M-L he would be expected to go out and test his knowledge with various individuals and organizations in order to gain access and become known to the Chinese. Andy emphasized it wouldn't be easy, that QRPHONE would have to be diligent and patient, but that in the end, if he was successful, the benefits would be many. QRPHONE accepted this.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Rod Sweet, Chief CA-3

ATTENTION : Mr. Ken Rosen, Rm 3D18

SUBJECT : ORPHONE/1

1. Attached is the psychological assessment of ORPHONE/1. A preliminary verbal read-out was given on 7 July in which it was stated that Subject was an emotionally stable individual. We still support this statement, but a more in-depth analysis revealed there are certain aspects of his personality that are susceptible. These are discussed in the report. If any part of the report is unclear or requires further discussion, please contact us. Meanwhile, we would appreciate receiving follow-up information on Subject's performance in order to help us refine and improve our methods of assessment.

# Direct Psychological Assessment
of
ORPHONE/1

The psychological evaluation consisted of an extended interview and the JBMINIMUM test. His intelligence as measured by the JBMINIMUM is within the Bright Normal range by U.S. standards. The test scores were not as high as would be expected in comparison to his behavior and life style. The discrepancy could be due to the fact that he suffers from inferiority feelings and is working overtime to compensate. He gets considerable satisfaction and mileage out of his authorship; however, it takes a great deal of his energy in order to discipline himself enough to write a book. His talents are much more in the field of journalism. Mentally alert and very perceptive, he is aware of what is happening around him. These same traits would serve him well as an access agent. However, his reporting may reflect some distortions because his memory is not strong, and he tends to remember those events that are of interest to him. He naturally has good manual- manipulative skills, plus a practical bent tha. should enable him to easily and effectively learn and carry out tradecraft techniques.

Emotionally, Subject is fickle. "Out-of-sight - out of mind," describes the way he relates to others. The reason for this is that one of his primary needs is to be accepted and liked. Most of his life has been spent seeking acceptance, and because he is emotionally dependent he rapidly and intensely becomes involved. If separated from someone with whom he is involved, he has difficulty maintaining loyalty, and begins to look for another way to satisfy his needs.

An important fact which his case officer should remember is that he is not motivated by an ideology, but rather by the person who represents a particular ideology. His relationship with his case officer is of prime importance. To ensure his loyalty to the organization and consistent performance, he will need intense handling. The problem is that he may balk since he resists authority. He has the tendency to think that he knows it all, as witnessed by his never completing a degree.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

ORPHONE/1

Subject is not by nature a role player, and it would not be operationally advantageous to have him switch roles, for he cannot psychologically handle role playing over a period of time. He has worked hard to establish an identity for himself, and could not cope as effectively with a new one.

Conclusion:

Subject is a bright, extremely ambitious, and aggressive individual who appears to be motivated to work for the Agency by three needs: 1) a need to be accepted and liked; 2) a materialistic need; and 3) as a vehicle to be vindictive to former loyalties, i.e., the far left or radical movement in this country.

Though he is capable of switching loyalties, and his life history attests to this fact, it is very difficult to predict his future behavior since so much depends on his life circumstances. One statement that can be made is that, given his personality, it is very doubtful if he would return to his former allegiances. But if not personally involved with someone from this agency who can give him acceptance and support, he is likely to look elsewhere for his need satisfactions.

1. QRPHONE/1 was trained covertly in New York from 22 June to 14 July 1972. There were sixteen sessions for a total of eighty-seven training hours.

2. This was a happy reunion of trainee and instructor. Less than two years ago, PHONE was given three days of reports training (Please see Completion of Training Report dated 19 October 1970). Just as then, PHONE was totally engrossed in every training session from the moment of his arrival to the moment of his departure. Remembering that the instructor does not eat lunch, PHONE brought a sandwich with him daily and took this lunch while listening to the instructer. Thus, every minute of every day was made to count.

3. The only time lost was three hours for JEMINIMUM and on the several phone calls he had to make daily to check for calls to his cover office, then follow up with calls to those persons who had called his office and had left messages to be called back. At the most, these calls took half an hour. On some days, they took far less.

4. His cover organization work took up a considerable portion, everyday, of his free time with the result that he could not do any casing to speak of for subsequent preparation of commo plans for exercises. For example, told early on to prepare two dead drop commo plans, he was not able to come up with anything till the last week -- end then with only one written one and one that he reveiwed orally. As a result he had to be given time during the training day to write reports of his countersurveillance exercises and one of his agent developmental exercises. After one such exercise, asked if he wished to take time out during the training day to write his report he said: "No, tonight I will make time to write it." And he did. And it was a good report.

5. On each Sunday, he went out of town to visit his aged Grandmother. He used the travel time to read tradecraft books (he read seven altogether).

On Tuesday, July 4th, his publisher appointed him baby sitter for the publisher's teen age son and there went any hope of getting any casing done that day. At least one time, he mentioned that he did not go to bed till two that morning and as he had left the afternoon before, he had stated that he had meetings starting at rour-thirty that afternoon. With all that, he nevertheless was fully alert and attentive every minute of every training session.

6. In his developmental recruitment series of exercises, his instructor played the role of operations officer -- and a real dumb-dumb he was. In such circumstances, PHONE had to do all the thinking, all the planning, all the casing for meeting sites, all the analyzing, all the preparing and pointing for the recruitment. It was pure joy to watch this man, after each meeting and again before the next one, go to work on the problem. He knew where he was, knew where he wanted to go, knew how to get there. When Mr. Rod Sweet, during the critique at the end of the series of exercises said: "He did a beautiful job," PHONE had earned that accolade all by himself. The instructor's only contribution had been in the teaching of the subject of Agent Acquisition.

7. At this point, the instructor wishes to execute a low bow in the direction of Mr. Sweet: He played his agent role excellently well and made the exercise a meaningful one for PHONE. The three trips to New York by Mr. Sweet must have been very taxing, particularly in view of his immediately upcoming TDY trip, but they were efforts well spent.

8. No man, of course, is perfect. Each has an Achilles heel, a weakness, or an all-too-human trait, at the very least. Our PHONE has his. He has a very quick mind. He knows it. And knowing it, he relies on it, counts on it. This, in turn, leads to a small failure in self-discipline. For example, told to write out his plan for the recruitment pitch, he came in with six words (maybe not that many) scratched on a 3 by 5 leaf torn out of his pocket notebook. He then proceeded, from these few words, to run off his plan without a single pause for en uh, hm, er, etc. It was as though he was reading a definition from a dictionary, so smoothly did his mind and thoughts run. He prepares everything in his mind, it appears, and does not like to write out that which he feels he should not have to write out. While it is great to have so facile a mind, a bit of discipline, to write out in full so important an act as a recuritment pitch, might one day save grief when an error would have been spotted had the entire plan been written out then looked over for possible flaws.

9. This small flaw, the instructor feels, accounts in considerable measure for PHONE's failure to bring in a written dead drop plan till the last days of the program. PHONE felt he could just as easily report orally. In fact, the other dead drop (he had been asked to do two) on which he reported orally, he discussed as though the peper was in front of him and he was reading from it. Nothing was missing -- area

description, access, hours of availability, the opposition, pros and cons as to suitability -- it was all there. He just didn't like to write out that upon which he could report orally.

10. In writing reports on the two counter-surveillance exercises, he dashed those off in jig time. No pause for thinking, no pause to look up at the ceiling or out the window. Just straight writing, includ- ing paragraphing. Mind and pen were as one. Same thing for his oral analysis before and after each meeting -- no pause to think, to review, to reconstruct, to remember -- just an IBM-type printout.

11. The instructor sets down this reluctance on our hero's part to write out certain things, not to downgrade him, but to alert desk and field officers that if they must have a certain report by a certain time, and they want it in writing, they must be firm. For example, after the second meeting in the developmental series, the instructor said: "I must have that report first thing in the morning. Do you want to take time out from this afternoon's training session to do it?" And, as already reported above, PHONE preferred to save the training time and he answered "I will make time to write it". In this case, time was of the essence because Mr. Sweet had to see the report before the next meeting. To sum up this item: When PHONE feels that an oral report is adequate he finds it a little difficult to bring himself to find time to make a written report. Told definitely that he must write a report and given a deadline, he meets the deadline and the report is everything it should be.

12. His reports on his recruitment meetings, Mr. Sweet said, were excellent. No jumping to conclusions, no padding, no misinterpretations, no omissions.

13. The surveillance team captain, reading PHONE's report on his actions during the countersurveillance exercises, narvelled at the completeness, total accuracy of description of the surveillants PHONE had made, including their ages (but always made each man an inch or two shorter than the actual height -- which PHONE admitted he does constantly), and the total recall of every move, every street crossing, every compass direction. (In the first countersurveillance exercise, sprung on PHONE without a moment's prior notice, he made one of his two surveillants. In the second one, with plenty of time to prepare, he made all three of them. These were two different teams from the New York Office of Security). Concluding his admiration of PHONE's reporting, the surveillance team captain said to the instructor: "You should be very proud of him".

14. In both exercises, the surveillance teams criticized the rapidity of PHONE's movements. He walks very rapidly from place to place, then spends time to browse in a book shop. Then off again at a high rate of speed to his next stop. They also criticized his looking both ways while crossing a one way street. They felt it made him appear

tail conscious. These are a typical New Yorker's habits. The instructor,
also a New Yorker, is guilty of the identical actions. We are highly
kinetic in our movements and as for looking both ways while crossing a
one-way street, we follow the old Marine Corps adage: "There's always
one S.O.B. that doesn't get the word". By sheerest coincidence, when
the instructor was on his way to the safesite to deliver the surveillance
team's report, he violated his own rule of looking both ways in crossing
a one-way street and was bowled over by a hippie on a loaded bike --
going the wrong way. Only the large heavy film case the instructor
was carrying kept him from being knocked flat.

15. Nevertheless, PHONE is now fully cognizant of the appearance
    that his actions create and will watch it in the future.

16. One last note on the counter-surveillance exercises: He
    chose his positions well and he camouflaged his actions beautifully.
    One example: The instructor called the surveillance team for a quick
    feedback on the first exercise and caught the men just as they returned
    to their office. They got on different phones for a three way conversation.
    They reported one incident as follows: "So rapid were PHONE'S novements,
    that when he met a friend of his, he hardly paused to speak with him,
    just waved him off". The second surveillant: "No, it didn't look like
    that at all, to me. To me it looked like this Indian-looking person
    stopped PHONE and asked him for directions and PHONE gave them and just
    went about his business". PHONE's own report, which he wrote up before
    he learned about the two different interpretations of the incident:
    "--- where I stopped a foreign-looking man, apparently Indian in origin
    and asked him for the Museum which I knew perfectly well is on 55th
    Street. I turned around as he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted
    the same man in the grey suit, now holding his hat in his hand".

17. In the second exercise, there were two items of note: One,
    the team was surprised to note in PHONE's report that PHONE even had
    the name of the book that the surveillant picked up when he followed
    PHONE into a book store. Second, when the exercise was over, the team
    compared notes and decided that PHONE may have made two of them but
    could not possibly have made the third man. n. The team captain, on reading
    PHONE's report, was stunned to see that PHONE had indeed made the third
    man also, but good.

18. PHONE had an elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop-
    mental acquisition series) with Mr. Harry Webster, an instructor in the
    New York office. After relating the fine job that PHONE had done, Mr.
    Webster's report concluded: "A first rate performance by PHONE, who's
    obviously been around -- both coverwise and for real".

19. His choice of meeting places with his agent could not be
    faulted. For one, he chose an East Side restaurant (where diplomants,
    as Mr. Sweet held himself out to be, would properly be seen dining).

Yet it was far enough away from the United Nations building to lessen the chances that PHONE himself and his putative diplomat terget would be spotted by friends or acquaintances. His choice for the next meeting was at an impressively named new restaurant near the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on the West Side of town. This restaurant wes located in the safesite complex. He was thus able very smoothly to invite his agent to the safesite from the restaurant for the recruiting pitch.

20. He did very well in executing two recognition meetings and two brush passes. He had no time to write his own commo exercises (as stated, he was able to write up only one dead drop commo plan) so he was given commo plans written up by another trainee. To give him variety, he was alternately the higher and the lower echelon, alternately accepted and made the hand-off.

21. In operational and intel reports, he did very well. He very successfully separated the operational from the intel info and the source comments from the positive intelligence.

22. Instructor's Observation: PHONE is a proud man, both as an individual and as an operator. While he was very discreet about it, very circumspect, he did, nevertheless, let the instructor know that he has, on occasion been handled with something less than pure genius. This, like the previous item, is noted not to down-grade PHONE, but to alert both desk and field officers that this man, being very sure, positive, definite and strong, hopes to be handled in a manner that would have those same words apply.

23. In sum: A very good man.

24. In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the training, we would appreciate a detailed evaluation report in July 1973 from the field station. This report should indicate the extent to which the training has made the trainee a more useful and effective asset and should evaluate the performance in each area of tradecraft in which training was conducted; negative as well as positive comments are solicited. The field station's report should also include the trainee's own comments. Please ask the field station to slug the report WOMOLD/ QRPHONE/1/SHAW. Upon receipt of the report at Headquarters, please forward a copy to the undersigned.

SECTION II

MOTIVATION AND CONTROL

1. ESTIMATE SUBJECT'S MOTIVATION. (Be detailed, al possible cate evidence. Do not use stock comment such as "anti- communist.") See Previous PRQ Part II

This image of BKTRUST as a powerful, professional organization has been enhanced in QRPACHE/l's case by the circumstances of his agent relationship, which require very professional handling. Indeed Q/1 has probably come to hold a rather glamorous "storybook" image of BKTRUST and of the importance of his contribution to the XXX EKTRUST EFFORT. This is a very human trait and should not be exaggerated in his case,

2. INDICATE WHAT CONTROL, IF ANY, EXISTS OVER THE SUBJECT. (If no control, or if there is a lack of control explain.)

QRPHONE/1 is dependent upon a EKTRUST salary and has signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. QRPHONE/1 is not a handling problem and there has never been any instance in which either he or his handler has had occasion to allued to these control factors.

SECTION III

COVER

1. COVER USED BY SUBJECT AND CASE OFFICER IN THEIR MEETINGS.

1.  but every one of the wild anti-BKTRUST stories which he heard probably only serves to accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of a very impressive outfit.

    Having accepted BKTRUST employment for a combination of reasons, it must be added that QRPHONE/1 clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which he has been able to live appeals to him.

QRPHONE/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial straits. BKTRUST has given him a job, paid him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to be independent of his wife's family's Charity.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Covert Action Staff

SUBJECT: Review of Project GRPHONE

1. A review in some depth of Project QRPHONE was conducted in January 1972 by DC/CA and me with Branch 3 personnel, with the participation of Richard Berkey (now of Branch 4, formerly QRPRONE Case Officer at LCPIPIT). Attached at Tab A are the questions which formed the basis for the review. A full record of the responses to these questions and the review discussion is not practical so I have attempted below to summarize the general conclusions which emerged. Attached at Tab B are two charts prepared by Branch 3 for the review plus a rough draft "CI Assessment" which they also prepared.

2. FI and CA. Excluding FBI Sensitive Reports, QRPHONE dropped from 157 reports in FY 1968 to 6 reports in FY 1971. His FI reports have evidently not been used as a basis for CA activities since 1967. This situation is apparently due to a variety of factors: the character of the man himself, restrictions placed upon him, a changing political context which compounded targetting difficulties, the complications of his own security situation, and the method by which be waB handled. It was agreed that QRPHONE does have inherent skills which should have an application to either FI or CA work. He is politically attuned; he writes well; be can handle contacts in several languages; he knows how to move internationally; he has an engaging social personality; he has an established (if controversial) reputation as a left-oriented journalist/writer with some scholastic credentials. The problem remains one of focussing his talents and determining the platform from which he should operate.

3. Mobility. QRPHONE can be viewed as essentially possessing mobility and has expressed a willingness to move. There are, however, qualifications on this. He has small children and an unwitting, anti-US, white, Jewish wife, who would only be willing to leave her homeland if the overt job to which QRPHONE was going was clearly a step upward in his career.

4. Handling. The method by which QRPHONE has been handled, i.e. mainly through Rodigast (although there has been direct LCPIPIT contact recently), is unnecessarily cumbersome and not suited to the close consultation needed to explore QRPHONE's future directions. Having been declared to the British Services the most secure place to meet QRPHONE is in the UK and he should be handled directly by an LCPIPIT officer.

5. Security. QRPHONE cannot escape the record of allegations that he is Agency-connected. What he can do, however, is face-up to these charges, challenge them and deny them. There may thus always be some element of suspicion attached to him, but, as time passes without definite proof of such a connection, its impact on his activities may be minimized and he may be able to engage in effective work inspite of it.

6. Sub-agents. It was felt that QRPHONE may possibly have a flair for recruiting and handling sub-agents. It was believed that this should be explored and that he should be given relevant training, based in New York. This would also provide the opportunity for Headquarters exploration with him of his future development.

7. Future Focus. What QRPHONE's own thoughts might be on his most natural course of development are not clear. He may have an inclination toward African Liberation Movements--the subject of his most recent major writing--but it could be questioned whether on this or on anti-fedayeen work, there is sufficient Agency interest to merit such focus. He has no significant base in the American black community (rather the contrary) which would make him of interest to others on this basis. His overt political orientation is described

as "radical," but it is an intellectual "radicalism," not revolutionary. Further, he is basically a theoretician not a personal activist by nature. He might be asked and might undertake an activist role-but it is felt that it would not sit naturally upon him and would probably not achieve whatever access might have been postulated. Within his theoretician, non-activist context it was nevertheless felt that the probably-to-be-expanded field of Chinese Communist activities in Europe provided the focus which might most usefully be explored. The expansion of Chinese Communist activities in Europe may come quite slowly but, in view of the probable shortage of assets in this field, it was a matter on which we should have some patience. It is also a field which could be explored without QRPHONE's needing to move. Whether be focusses on this field or another, however, QRPHONE needs to develop some job or organizational base which will make him interesting as a target himself to those we wish to focus hin on. At the present time his cover does not provide a power or influence base and he is essentially completely dependent upon us.

8. CA Staff Termination/Redirection Responsibility.
   It was felt that in this process of redirection of QRPHONE, CA Staff should retain responsibility for QRPHONE. Even if a London-based assignment did not work out and it was decided to move QRPHONE to another area CA Staff should keep the project during the trial period and with this the responsibility for termination if the trial proved unsuccessful. If the trial was successful, on the other hand, then we would have discharged our responsibility for QRPHONE and could relinquish control.

9. Some time has passed since the above discussions took place. I am not aware of the extent to which there may already have been a follow-up to them. Needless to Bay, they have decided field implications in which LCPIPIT needs to be consulted, should they be pursued.

## AGENT EVALUATION

NAME: QRPHONE/1

DATE: 18 January 1971

PROJECT: QRPHONE

STATUS: Contract Agent (Under
a Memorandum of Oral
Agreement)

OVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: International correspondent for "Sunday supplement"
type color magazine distributed by twenty major newspapers in the
U.S. Also represents owner of this color magazine in other of
his business ventures in Europe. This overt job was assumed in
December 1970. Prior to that, Q/1 was the London representative
of small U.S. news service. Q/1 does free lance journalism and
is an occasional contributor to several magazines and newspapers.

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left,
including Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups.
Q/l's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and
without posing problems for his handler. His personality is
easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not
always totally successful -- leaving us with tantalizing bits
of information and many uranswered questions -- this is generally
due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable
to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job
as a journalist. He has acquitted himself well both as a
representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.
Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and
in this connection the operation profits particularly from the
energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself
has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below
under Motivation.)

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/l's attitude is good. He has made
an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to
understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former
cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement
with enthusiasm.

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on
which a good deal has beensaid over the course of this operation.
The following points can be made on the subject of Q/1's
motivation:

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 49

SECRET

B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional organization has been enhanced in Q/l's case by the circumstances of his agent relationship, which require very professional handling. Indeed Q/1 has probably come to hold a rather glamorous "storybook" image of JKLANCE and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE effort. This is a very human trait and should not be exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti- JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of a very impressive outfit.

c. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1 has become active in at least two "causes". In both instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact that he is an American (and does not consider himself disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE to report on those currents. He does not give any indication that he views this as "squealing" on his friends -- indeed the contrary seems to be the case.

E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1 clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which he has been able to live appeals to him.

G. In assessing the relative importance of these several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under- signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more underlying. Band F have arisen since recruitment and probably play an important role in his current motivation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 50

# SECRET

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Q/l's wife is not witting of his
JKLANCE affiliation. She was allowed to believe that he was
working indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware
of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at
Q/1, but as far as Q/1 can determine (and this is not a subject
on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she
continues to accept the Chinese story. It should be added
that Mrs. Q/1 is British and is the holder of some rather
typical "left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should also be noted
that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety
of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed --
lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of
money received from Q/l's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
personality and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/1.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
accept guidance and criticism -- provided it is constructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
him. In this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
press for all the desired details.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has
signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/1 is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1. has a good sense of personal security and his
handler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 51

SECRET

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of Q/l's affiliation with JKLANCE, many pré-dating his actual recruitment, add an extra diacasion Loi's cover situation. We have no indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof, nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of contacts.

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative burden. He is not overly concerned about his administrative and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected, he can be very upset.

REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective reporter -- both in terms of ability to elicit and writing style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANCE: Q/1 is quite energetic and can continue his efforts on a sustained basis.

LANGUAGES: In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French, Italian and German.

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel and even enjoys it!

AREA KNOWLEDGE: Q/1 is quite widely travelled in Europe and Africa and consequently has acquitted an extensive area knowledge.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Q/l's present operating context does not provide an adequate basis to evaluate these talents. It is assumed that he has a satisfactory competence in both these areas, however.

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses, either personal or professional which inhibit his operational use. The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts is a definite limitation on his employment.

CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Q/1 has mentioned to his handler that he hopes to be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE. He enjoys the work and presumably the financial security. However,

SECRET

the combination of the security factors operative in this case and the unlikelihood of Q/l's contirued eccess to targets of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being regarded as a career asset.

FIELD CASE OFFICER

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the Case Officer.

I doubt that we have really divined Q/l's motivations for working with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab we can make at this enigmatic subject.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3

SUBJECT : Chicom Aspect of QRPHONE/1's Operational Potential

1. In continuing my efforts to probe operational areas for the redirection of QRPHONE/1, I talked at length on 3 January with his former case officer (Mr. Richard Berkey) and received a very favorable prognosis regarding QRPHONE/l's mobility (i.e. his possible move to another European city or to Africa), his agent recruiting capability (preceded by additional training), and the prospects of making himself attractive to the Chicoms (again preceded by appropriate training).

2. In pursuit of the latter item I talked at length today with Mr. Andrew Ness, the FE Division expert on long-range Chicom and CP penetration programs. I described in detail QRPHONE/1's background, current status, and the variety of plans we have in mind and received Ness' reactions as follows:

A. The butterfly characteristics that QRPHONE has demonstrated thus far will never result in his becoming of interest to either the Chicoms or the Soviets for any operationally meaningful purpose. While the Soviets would perhaps see him as potential FI source, the Chicoms would not even do that.

B. Chicom officers abroad are still totally obsessed with Communist doctrine and its strategic and tactical application to a degree significantly more zealous than their Soviet counterparts. Therefore, in looking at potential foreign assets the Chicoms discard persons of shallow substance as far as their knowledge of Communism is concerned. They are interested in only those who have a serious intellectual understanding of Communist doctrine and a serious revolutionary goal. The thousands of leftists of whatever coloring floating around Europe are seen as only of marginal use to the Chicoms and certainly not the sort that they would take into their confidence.

SECRET

![GROUP 1 Excluded from automatic downgrading and declassification]


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 55

SECRET

C. To become of long-term operational use to us in the sense of exploiting his possible long-term use to the Chicoms, QRPHONE/1 should do two things: join an existing "acceptable" organization such as the Trotskyite Party or a black radical party and, at the same time begin a serious study of Marxist/Maoist doctrine. As he gets into this program (preceded by some ten days training and close Headquarters direction) he should begin to seek out Communist intellectuals, party members, leaders of radical groups, etc., to ask questions about the dialectic, seek additional guidance, borrow books and so forth. In doing this he will in time come into the attention of the professional spotters the Chicoms have and begin to develop the sort of bona fides that the Chicoms, in time, will find appealing. He should also in this period seek out Chicom officials with the same requests for help. The key here is to demonstrate not that QRPHONE/1 is simply sympathetic, with Maoism or any other Communist shading but that he is a dedicated serious revolutionary.

D. A quicker way to come into the Chicom spot- light might be for QRPHONE/1 to join the Black Panthers, the SDS or one of the other radical groups with which the Chicoms are already known to be in touch. He will obviously have to sweat out a period of probation in joining any such group until he divests himself of his tattered leftist reputation and those JKLANCE accusations. Ness feels that a successful passing of this baptismal period will depend solely on QRPHONE/1's willingness to plunge wholeheartedly into a serious study of the terribly boring and lengthy volumes of the dialectic. As he demonstrates his capability to move more deeply into this field to the satisfaction of the "spotters" he will be accordingly provided additional help and encouragement by Chicom contacts and officials.

E. The Chicoms will be looking at him as a possible asset in their long-range targetting of the American revolution, hense QRPHONE/1's utterances ought to be couched in terms of his ultimate aim of contributing to and participating in the American revolution. In other words the Chicoms would see little or no use for QRPHONE/1 operationally in Europe or Africa (just as we would assess and recruit a Thai for operations in Thailand, not in Nigeria).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 56

F. Ness felt that should we pursue the above as a long-term operational goal for QRPHONE/1, the city in which this takes place is almost irrelevant. He could do it perhaps as well in an African setting as in Europe and his cover status i.e., with LPWEAKLY, really makes no difference because the Chicoms would test the fiber man himself and would not be deterred by his external trappings.

3. In answer to my question, Ness said he would be happy to meet with QRPHONE to assess his potential in this area and then, assuming we all decided to go ahead with such redirection, Ness could train him and guide him thoroughly enough to get him well on the track by spending some seven to ten days with him on a concentrated program.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Covert Action Staff

SUBJECT: QRPHONE

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum, Same Subject, Dated 29 November 1971

1. What follows below are some initial comments of mine on the referent memorandum, per your request. We really feel in Branch 3 that for a variety of reasons, we need more time to deliberate on QRPHONE's future operational activity than the previous two weeks, Partly this is due to extended absence by the case officer in charge who has been plagued with a recurring Illness--I believe you are familiar with this. It is also in part attributable to the Section Chief's being new to the position and having his time absorbed by matters of current priority. So if you don't mind, we should like to address ourselves further to this subject following the Christmas holidays. At that time we should like to initiate some meetings on this matter both with yourself and with other area components including representatives from CI Staff.

2. Background: Your memo, of course, was triggered by an earlier one of mine which proposed that QRPHONE become operationally engaged in attempting to establish a black Communist cell in either Paris or Rome. The purpose of this would be twofold-- namely, to exacerbate relations thereby between the Soviet Union and mainland China through various low-key covert action undertakings, and in the process to further enhance QRPHONE's own credentials as a Maoist activist. This tentative assignment, it should be noted, arose because Branch 3 personnel had become increasingly aware of the possibility that ORPHONE's project status might be terminated in the not too distant future. While it is true that in the immediate preceding month or so, we have benefited from his intelligence reporting, it is all too clear that over the past two years, he has been of diminishing utility to CA Staff and other area divisions. In discussing his future with his recent case officer, Miss Chatelan, her recommendation was that unless something could be found for him In the near future, we should give serious consideration to terminating

his services during the coming year. Thus my foregoing proposal
arose from a desire on my part not to terminate an asset of proved
capabilities without giving the agent in question suitable opportunity
to become useful once more.

3. CI Type Review/QRPHONE Personal Security: Your memo
   makes out there have been frequent security reviews of QRPHONE's
   security status, and you question the efficacy of our doing still one
   more. On this let me point out that in making such a security assess-
   ment, we would be doing so in response to a current request by the
   area division concerned whose cooperation we need to direct this
   agent. One hardly needs stress that such a request probably should
   be honored in the interests of maintaining good relations even if its
   fulfillment means redundant work. But apart from this, the case
   officer also informs me that the case file does not contain any general
   summary of the alleged security breaches involving QRPHONE and
   their implications vis-a-vis his activities. It is true however that his
   security status has been reviewed for each annual project review and
   that assessments of his security status were made following each
   alleged breach, but no up-to-date summary exists. As for our own
   gut feelings on his personal security, one hazards that he is still in
   pretty good shape. I agree with you that many of the past charges
   leveled against him are of the same ilk as those leveled against other
   leftist colleagues(who do not have any Agency association) by their
   rivals. And as for the structure of his case officer relationship--
   that is, having him handled by a deep cover officer from an adjacent
   country--this would appear to be secure in the extreme (so much
   so that one would advocate that it be dropped due its operational
   Inefficiency.)

4. Location: We tentatively agree that in all likelihood Paris
   should not be the venue for our proposed operational undertaking due
   the location of the Wright clan. Rome, however, might do very well.
   If not Rome, perhaps you or EUR Division might suggest another
   locale. As for the question as to whether or not the Rome station would
   want him permanently, only time and his own perational success could
   determine this. One hazards that if QRPHONE were able to make his
   way with some good local leftists and had promise of developing some
   kind of relationship with mainland China representatives, the station
   might come to regard him as a capital asset.

5. Substance: You noted that ORPHONE . . . "cannot just simply show up and start a leftist nuclei . . ." Why not? Others have. He is a well-known leftist in intellectual circles in Europe and has written many articles in praise of Mao. This should do for a start. As for what he might have to offer local leftists money, energy and ideas will do. A great deal of money. of course, Is unneeded, but some is. We can supply it. As for ideas and energy, he has both. Concerning the "built-in jealousy, animosity, etc." which such action would likely engender on the part of local rival leftists, this may or may not occur. But is this such a calamity If it should occur? Are not leftists usually fighting among themselves anyway? In any case, we have nothing to lose by trying to salvage this agent. What we have to lose by not trying is an agent asset of proved worth.

6. Credentials: You say in effect that QRPHONE has not been known as an activist but only as an intellectual, (Frankly, the distinction is not very important in my mind.) Be that as it may, he has written many articles on leftist subjects and has talked to Innumerable leftists around Europe over the years. True, he has not been involved in such actions as street demonstrations, but we would not like him to be so personally involved in the future in any case. What we would want him to do is to write pamphlets, informally recruit associates to his group and provide a little money to the group as might be required for various undertakings. Aside from the organizing and funding, actually this is not very different from what he has been doing--except that it will be in one place for a change.

7. Book Dispatch Sale: You may be very correct in saying that shopping him around to European stations by book dispatch is a poor way to solicit useful tasks for QRPHONE. But again, I took my lead from C/EUR/CA who made a request along these lines. Certainly sending book dispatches wouldn't hurt any. If Spence is willing at some future time to visit various field stations and to attempt selling QRPHONE's services personally, we would be happy to have him do so. We, of course, don't know when he will be available to do so, and time is passing.

8. Concluding Comment: I really feel that we should relate to you in some detail the success which Andy Ness once had with the kind of undertaking which we have proposed for QRPHONE. It may Interest you. On the other hand, it may be perfectly possible that the situation which Andy Ness once manipulated is not applicable to

the conditions which would confront ORPHONE In say Rome. But
If we are not to channel his energies in this direction, it is incumben:
upon us to think of something else for him to do before we begin
thinking about writing him off. And so when you suggest that . . .
"the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment
of the project. . ." I agree. And to this end, we should like a couple
of weeks more before coming to you with some general conclusions
of ours about the current viability of thi. case and some future
alternative course of action.

MEMORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3

SUBJECT: Operational Redirection of QRPHONE/1

1. In response to your request that I examine the QRPHONE/1 project to determine how it might best be redirected in order to gain greater value for the time and money involved, I have talked at some length with appropriate officers in CI/SO and Africa Division. I have been advised that the primary reasons for QRPHONE/1's dwindling productivity are as follows:

A. Key centers of activity of the radical left in Europe are London, Paris, and Stockholm. For different reasons QRPHONE/1's access in these three capitals is either circumscribed or off target. The British have asked that he not operate in London against African targets. His reputation among target groups of interest to us in Paris and Stockholm has been so tarnished that he has not taken into their confidence significantly enough to be of value.

B. Although he has a multitude of contacts among the left, virtually all are shallow, periodic, and then very brief when they do occur. Even his correspondence to the more important radical leaders, which used to be quite informative, has fallen to almost nothing.

C. Because his contacts are so cursory, he has been unable to develop a close and continuing personal relationship with any one of them in order to develop the intimate confidence so necessary for operational exploitation.

D. His cover has always been thin and thus has circumstantially at least lent credence to the periodic allegations of his being a JKLANCE agent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 65

# SECRET

E. Close case officer direction has been made very difficult. because of the echelons existing between QRPHONE/1 and LCPIPIT, coupled with relative infrequency of field case officer meetings.

F. What contacts he has within the African target, for example, are rendered virtually useless because his case officers are unfamiliar on a timely basis with Africa Division requirements and also miss valuable operational leads simply because they do not recognize them. (This is no fault of the case officers because they obviously have little opportunity to keep abreast of such requirements.)

G. The somewhat artificial nature of his trying to portray a pro-Mao stance may help him a bit with targets similarly inclined but renders him ineffective with other political shadings among the left.

2. With all of the above in mind and without belaboring the history of this project, the following recommendation is offered and has been concurred in informally by CI/SO and Africa Division officers with whom I have talked.

A. Accepting the fact that QRPHONE/1's operational utility in Europe is minimal, I propose LCPIPIT be directed to begin making arrangements for his transfer PCS to Africa and, hence, his operational control transferred to Africa Division as soon as feasible.

B. From the point of view of MHCHAOS requirements and Africa Division's own requirements, both elements felt QRPHONE/1 could best be exploited in Tanzania. It is one of the two most active cities in Africa for the radical left, it is a hot-bed of both Soviet and Chicom shenanigans, and it is politically vital to East African stability.

C. However, because of QRPHONE/1's well-known association with two exiled Tanzanian opposition politicians in London and current reports that these oppositionists are plotting the overthrow of President Nyere (perhaps with Soviet assistance), it would be very imprudent for QRPHONE/1 to arrive bag and baggage in Dar es Salaam in the near future. Nyere and his police might well conclude that QRPHONE represents the advance probe of the coup plotters and promptly throw him into jail.

D. Both to give QRPHONE/1 time to cleanse his tattered image and because there are almost as important operational tasks in West Africa, the idea is to move him (1) to Nigeria or (2) to Ghana for perhaps a year. This is to be done in concert with a suitable strengthening of his cover (i.e. two or three more stringerships) and a concurrent mutation of his political posture to that of a plain old anti-imperialist rather than the more confining pro-Mao stance. He would be run directly by Lagos or Accra Station against local targets but with periodic trips to other parts of Africa for cover as well as operational purposes. Meantime, in the intervening months the dust may settle a bit in Tanzania, the close association with opposition elements would be allowed to fade and QRPHONE/1's writings and pronouncements concerning Tanzania would be calculatedly designed to support the Nyere government.

E. At the appropriate time, a year or so perhaps, he then moves PCS to Tanzania.

3. If you concur with the above, I will procede to staff this out more formally here at Headquarters and to advise LCPIPIT.

# PROJECT QRPHONE

PART A. CHARTS REQUESTED

Chart I: For the period FY 1967 through FY 1971 provide the number of disseminated reports according to the subject field of the report. The headings would be: Fiscal Year, African Independance Movements, Anti-US Demonstrations, European Maoist Groups (etc., or whatever other subject fields you wish to set up).

Chart II: List the specific events or organizations against which covert action was in fact undertaken and give the number of QRPHONE reports which were submitted on such events/organizations.

PART B. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. What is the basic reason for this being a CA Staff project (other than history)? To provide multi-divisional tasking for FI purposes of general U.S. intelligence interest? To provide CA operational information for possible DDP use?

2. As regards FI reports, which have lately been described as being of only marginal interest, the main criticisms appear to be a lack of depth and detail. CA Staff's counter to this has been that QRPHONE goes as far as he can, and can go no further through elicitation. Have these depth/detail criticisms been valid? Is our defense valid, or could he reasonably be expected to elicit more depth and detail than he does?

3. If he can go no further through elicitation and we wish to keep him on the FI path, what is implied? That he develop and run agents himself? That he actually goes to work for an organization of intelligence interest to us? How realistic would either of these lines of pursuit be?

Draft.

1958

Q/1 worked for Agence France Presse - Paris. He was discharged by AFP when Ollie Harrington (American negro) brought forgery charges against him.

Q/1 sent to a weekly American publication and to the British daily The Observer, over the signature of O. Harrington, xxx violently anti-French articles which were printed and could have brought about the expulsion of author. William G. Smith (still in Paris), Richard Wright (deceased) widow still living in Paris and John Flint all took sides with Harrington.

30 July 1964. Accusations received from unidentified Americans, members of USA CP reportedly forward to Verges, editor of *Revolution* certain documents which established Q/1 was working on behalf of CIA. This was because of fight over money that was due Q/1 and his wife. (Q/1 had his lawyer bring suit against Verges and finally in 1969 Verges agreed to pay certain amount and also an apology. This Q/1 can use to counteract the accusations by Verges.

Fall 1966 FBI Report: Source recently advised that during the Fall 1966, a member of an Italian pro-Chinese Marxist Leninist Organization stated that Subject was suspected of being a spy for CIA. This person reported this to Rene Raindorf a member of the Jacques Grippa Pro Chinese Belgian CP.

June 1967: XXXX FBI Report: GRIPPA and RAINDORF indicated to a member of an American pro-Chinese Communist organization that they thought highly of Q/1 and that they were of the belief he was doing a good job (in the cause of


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 69

militant Marxism-Leninism).

March 1968: Stockholm. _AFTONBLADET_ Radical Social Democratic Daily 18 March 1968 published Photo and Biog Data on & Q/1 in conjunction with story recent redefection

American soldier Ray Jones implying Q/1 responsible in part Jones redefection.

Note: Bjorn Kuam, an Aftonbladet journalist who is a friend of G/1's wrote him a long inttex and unsolicited letter the day following the appearance of the article in which he denounced his paper for libeling Q/1 and gave Q/1 advice on how to proceed to clear his name.

Stockholm. _TIDSIGNAL_ / Fadical Weekly - Also published article re Q/1.

Bo Hanmar editor of TIDSIGNAL is pro-Cuban, and be 0/1 loyal@ to Williams who is anti-Cuban. They oppose Q/1 for his pro-Chinese and anti-Cuban stance.

May 1969: 8 Report from Pretoria 6916 (in 49487) That 0/1 is now suspected widely of being both a CIA agent and a South African Intell contact.

Dec. 1969" Report from FBI: Source stated that he overhcard Cleaver accuse Bon Wright from Chicago of being seen in company of Q/1 whom Cleaver characterized as a well known CIA agente This was at the Algerian Congress - Falestine Dec. 1962.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 70

1970
Feb. SYNIC: a London publication of leftist orientation, carried an article mentioning Q/1 by name and stating that he is widely believed to be an CIA agent. (Two of the four persons listed as contributons to SYNIC were at the Algiers Palestine Solidarity Meeting which Q/1 attended in Dec. 1969.

They were members of the British delegation representing the Palestine

Solidarity Committee (PSC) which was a rival delegation to that led by A. Manchanda in which Q/1 sat. This W/ Q/1 believes this story was printed in order to discredit the Manchanda-led Palestinian group which is in competition with the PSC.

8 Feb. 1970: BEIRUT 6963 (IN 262712). Reliable Source reported that during his conversation with Ghassan KANAFANI, latter mentioned 0/1 and accused him of being a CIA agent. (Q/1 believes KANAFATI picked suspicion of 9/1 due to accusatio tions against Q/1 spread in Beirut by Palestinian personalities who were formerly in London and who picked up story as result of accusation leveled against Q/1 in SYNIC.)

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CA/B-3

SUBJECT: QRPHONE

REFERENCE: Your Memorandum, Subject: QRPHONE
Operations in Europe, Dated 24 November
1971

1. I made some notes in the margin of referent memorandum upon first reading it. However, since these are too brief, I thought it best to let you have my thoughts on this matter in fuller form.

2. As you may know, we had tried for years to give QRPHONE more meaningful assignments, but there are certain facts about him and the operation today which simply cannot be ignored. It seems to me that your memorandum takes inadequate account of these factors.

a. Security: RODIGAST's and QRPHONE's personal security cannot be faulted, in my judgment. However, that has not protected QRPHONE from accusations of being CIA, which have haunted him throughout the years. This is such an endemic charge in the milieu in which he operates that I feel certain he would have had the same charges leveled at him whether or not the Ollie Harrington incident had happened in Paris.

b. Location: Apart from the efficiency of the French police, there are a number of good reasons arguing against the desirability of QRPHONE's even going to Paris for a meeting, let alone being stationed / there (e.g., protection of RODIGAST's identity, the Harrington incident, and the location there of the Wright clan). I cannot imagine why he would consider it, or why we should advocate it.

A different cover for a move to Rome might be developed, but not that of a Maoist developing new cells. Rome Station is glad to have him come there and give them "grass roots" reports whenever he visits, but would they want him permanently??

Substance: More generally, QRPHONE cannot just simply show up and start forming nuclei -- there are already Maoist nuclei -- the various Marxist-Leninist parties (miniscule though they may be) that existed, and they continue to exist with or without Chinese help. If he were to have something to offer them -- money, preferably -- they might welcome him with open arms. Otherwise he will encounter built-in jealousy, animosity, rivalry, and a source of accusation all over again.

d. Credentials: As a Maoist intellectual (or an intellectual Maoist??), QRPHONE can travel all over. As a Maoist activist, he has only minimal credentials. The only group he is actively involved with is Manchanda's insignificant group -- and even with that he has never carried a placard, and I doubt if he has even helped them with making up a placard. He has helped them with their press releases, leaflets, etc. In short, with the written word, not the deed. By nature which we must also take into consideration -- QRPHONE is no longer a "doer" -- if he ever was one. And I doubt very much that he can at this stage in his life become a "doing" radical. We would be misusing his natural talents, which could still serve us well, in favor of dubious undertaking.

In effect, the proposal (if I read it correctly) is to have QRPHONE develop a group which would serve to distribute anti-Soviet material. I cannot judge if that would be worth the cost ($40,000??) to Rome, but I doubt it. I also do not know enough about the "Andy Ness" operation to comment on that aspect, particularly as to its feasibility in a sophisticated European community.

e. Book Dispatch Sale: Shopping him around to the European Stations is the wrong approach, in my judgment. In the first place, any Station likely to have a use for him is already extremely well up on QRPHONE's background. There are only three Stations really

heavily involved in anti-CP ops (in which field I suppose this would fall), and those three have former CI/ICG men who know QRPHONE well: Breckenridge, Hornstein and Friend. QRPHONE has talents and abilities and weaknesses which can best be explained/sold in person, not through dispatch. I think, that the way to do it, if at all, is by Spence during a visit to these Stations.

f. "CI-Type" Review: A review of the file will show how often this has been done, and how thoroughly. (I can understand Horvath asking for a security review -- he had no background knowledge of the operation that would have given him this information.) I do not know what you now expect to find. In all frankness, and unless CI Staff feels the need for yet another review and is willing to undertake it, I would consider a Staff-internal review pretty much a waste of time.

3.  Having gone around this problem several times in the past several years with CI Staff and the pertinent area divisions (as the files will clearly show), I am most doubtful that any of them will consider QRPHONE of sufficient interest (current or potential) to pay what it costs to maintain him. We may be able to justify it since we attempt (as no one area division would) -- and to some extent succeed -- to target him on a multi-divisional basis. In light of these considerations, and since I have developed serious reservations on the long range viability of this operation (in terms of the cost-effectiveness factor), I believe that the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment of the project. After some internal discussions, this will also, of course, entail consultations with the CI Staff and at least three area divisions.

4. I will appreciate receiving your comments by mid-December.

24 November 1971

MEMORANDUM OF MEETING

SUBJECT: QRPHONE Operations in Europe

1.  Mr. Leo Horvath, EUR/CA, and myself briefly discussed prospective QRPHONE operations on 8 November. During the discussion I outlined to him a general proposal which had been bruited about during my recent TDY at LCPIPIT in mid-October. In substance, this proposal was that following QRPHONE's forthcoming trips through Scandinavia and Africa, he then repair to either Rome or Paris for an extended period of time. In either of these locations he would then attempt to identify and to enlist the cooperation of various unwitting contacts in the left sector of the student and youth population, who could assume in time the trappings of a Maoist study group. QRPHONE would have excellent cover for doing so inasmuch as he is an established writer of the Maoist stripe. His relationship with these contacts or followers would not be set in the routine JKLANCE operational context. Rather, he would guide and motivate such contacts as would an alleged covert representative of a Maoist group, and would claim to have been a member of a larger such group say, in Britain. He would, of course, imply to his followers that he is attempting to develop a similar nucleus in (France) (Italy) or whenever, as good Communists should.

2.  Operational activity would be of a twofold nature. First, exploitation of the prospective group of Maoists would follow along lines of a typical black Communist cell, emulating the kind of notional movement which Mr. Andy Ness developed in the Middle East some seven or eight years ago. Hopefully, these unwitting followers, in turn, would each recruit two or three other sympathizers who over time could distribute anti-Soviet literature and perform other low-key CA operations, as directed by the Station, and which could be attributed to the PRC. Presumably their actions would result in some local embarrassment to the USSR and the PCI. Second, QRPHONE, himself, would no doubt enhance his own Maoist credentials--already strong--to the point where he might well become

of focal interest to the PRC. This could lead to
invitations to Peking (as it did in Ness's case) and
possibly an FI operation of consequence vis-a-vis the
China target.

3. The efficacy of the aforementioned scheme seemed
   to pose some doubts to Mr. Horvath. On the one hand, he
   did not feel that either Rome or Paris Stations had
   sufficient case officer strength on hand to direct and
   support a tricky operation of this type which might have
   only marginal utility, in their view. As for Paris,
   the French police, being as efficient as they are, would
   probably come upon QRPHONE's "black net" in time, and
   could conceivably pose security problems for him. As
   an alternative, Mr. Horvath proposed that CA Staff write
   a general dispatch to all EUR Stations describing the
   asset and indicating that the Staff would like to see
   greater use made of QRPHONE's capabilities on the
   Continent. The dispatch should ask the Stations to comment
   on the service that QRPHONE might provide them and suggest
   the means for accomplishing it. Mr. Horvath also asked
   that, prior to forwarding the dispatch, a security review
   be conducted of this case. He did comment that, if the
   security review indicated no severe compromises of
   QRPHONE's cover or personal security, it would be a
   pity not to make greater use of this agent's notable
   contacts in the European leftist community.

4. Accordingly, I agreed with Mr. Horvath's two
   recommendations; namely, to conduct a security review of
   the case and, subsequently, to forward a blanket dispatch
   to the Field, if appropriate. I mentioned that we would
   still like to raise the possibility of a black operation
   in Paris and Rome in that dispatch and to this, Mr. Horvath
   posed no objections.

Addendum: Following the above conversation, Miss Jane Long
has initiated a CI type of review of the Subject's
security status.

4. The charge is made that QRPHONE is too thinly spread and there is a recurring urge that his targetting be better focussed. Can he in fact be better focussed on a multi-divisional basis or would focussing, in practice, result in his being narrowed down to a primarily divisional target?

5. Granting that the CIA label is somewhat indiscriminately used for character assassination in the conspiratorial fringe in which QRPHONE has been operating, isn't he in fact stuck with this label and in view of the international character of this conspiratorial fringe, won't it turn up wherever he goes? In this milieu is there really much chance he will be given any significant information (and not deception information) by anyone who will do so because he wants the information passed to CIA?

6. When he was looked into in April 1968 by a Chicom official, what do we suppose to be meant by the officials finding that it was not clear if he was completely reliable in a Marxist-Lenist sense?

7. How eagerly sought-after are travelers to China now-a-days? What is the forecast as to demand for such travelers by next summer?

8. With a reportedly anti-US, white, British wife and 3 small children, how really mobile is QRPHONE in a PCS sense? If we should move QRPHONE and family to a new location for a trial period and it didn't work out, wouldn't resettling him have considerable complications?

9. In how many languages does QRPHONE have verbal and written fluency?

10. What are the current clearance limitations upon our use of QRPHONE?

11. One gathers from the project renewals that QRPHONE'S CIA status is known to MI-5, MI-6 and Scotland Yard. A French service penetration (UNDERBID/39) indicated


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 82

that Rodigast was under some suspicion. QRPHONE has
been refused entrance at the border by the Swiss
authorities. Does anyone doubt that in view of the
groups and individuals he contacts on his travels he
has a dossier in each of these countries? Does anyone
doubt that in many of these dossiers the alleged CIA
connection is recorded? In view of this, isn't it a fact
that probably the safest place for him to be contacted
is London, in spite of whatever tradecraft he and
Rodigast may practice? In spite of a rapport and back-
ground knowledge elements which he undoubtedly benefits
from with Rodigast, are these factors worth the extra
handling complications? Doesn't this handling method
essentially double the cost of the operation?

12. What were the reasons for the break with "Fair
    Play for Cuba?" the break with Verges? Does QRPHONE
    have a power base at all among American negroes (SNCC
    doesn't like him and it is recorded in the renewals that
    blacks and revolutionaries sense that he is not "sincere")?

13. Can't we determine right here at Headquarters
    the degree of interest in the Italian branch in having
    a rather low-level propaganda operation involving anti-
    Soviet propaganda ostensibly emanating from pro-Chicom
    sources? Now that the PRC has decided to go "legit,"
    what is our best estimate as to the likelihood that they
    will lose interest in previous and current pro-Chicom
    fringe groups?

14. Other than on the above, if we asked QRPHONE
    to become involved in depth with one of the groups he
    is in touch with, wouldn't he have to act "more Royalist
    than the King," and wouldn't he be the first to come
    under suspicion in case action against the group pointed
    to a leak?

15. If he could not take covert action himself
    through such a group to what extent are we now or
    potentially likely to become involved with covert
    action by other groups against:

*   anti-Vietnam action
*   African liberation movements
*   New Left groups
*   pro-Chicom groups
*   Fedayeen groups


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 83

16. What are QRPHONE's real talents? Why hasn't he been able to do more about establishing himself on a more self-sustaining basis? Is it because of the targets we keep pushing him on? What is meant by these allusions to QRPHONE's "work discipline?" Do his talents possibly point toward some covert action use in a role where the CIA label is relatively less important?

JAGUAR Reporting on African Expatriates in London

REFERENCES:

b. OELA-53,167 (24 Dec 70)

c. DIRECTOR 063010 (27 Aug 70)

d. OEPA 3090 (18 Jan 70)

1. For over a year ZIBET personnel have sought to stimulate more SMORANGE reporting on the activities of certain high level African expatriates in London. Up to now the results have been meager and discouraging, and in addition JAGUAR gained JKLANCE's agreement that QRPHONE/1 should desist from pursuing these London targets.

2. Perhaps stemming from the recent visit of SMOVID to Headquarters, however, we have just received an informative and useful report, prepared by JAGUAR, on Osumba Langi, the principal radical Kenyan expatriate in London, along with promises of other studies on targets mentioned during the Headquarters discussions. This is possibly a hopeful note for the future.

3. Prior to this development, JKLANCE had received only one report from JAGUAR in response to various appeals and the submission of requirements. That report, received in December 1970 was in response to Headquarters-supplied requirements forwarded the previous February (and resubmitted in August 1970), but contained very little positive information. Furthermore, the report's format and tone suggested that JAGUAR'S reply was intended as a one-time affair. It certainly did not invite further questions nor indicate an intention to volunteer further details later.

4. In reviewing the correspondence on this matter, it was noted that the verbatim minutes of February 1970 Headquarters discussions with SMENCE and SMUMBRAGE contained a passage that may cast new light on JAGUAR's position. In response to ZIBET officers' queries about what JKLANCE could expect from JAGUAR (it previously having been made clear by the SMOTH officers that the target was JAGUAR's), the visiting SMOTH officers said of JAGUAR's position: "They have a suitcaser top."

constitutional problem with their responsibilities to IDEN. The idea
of passing out political information on exiles is repulsive to him."
It should be noted for the record that JAGUAR itself has not given
such an explanation to JKLANCE, but, knowing JAGUAR's bureaucratic
position and its traditionally conservative role in the SMORANGE
commmity, it may be that JAGUAR in fact is thus inhibited.

5. As to QRPHONE/1, SMOVID on 15 June 1970 followed up his March
   1970 complaints to JADHIN about QRPHONE/1's contacts with expatriates
   in London. SMOVID expressed JAGUAR's concern about QRPHONE/I's security
   and its view that QRPHONE/1's information was of carginal value. SMOVID
   emphasizing that he was expressing a view personally endorsed by
   SMUPSILON, outlined three possible options: withdraw QRPHONE/1 from
   the country; stop running and tasking QRPHONE/1 as an agent; or have
   JAGUAR take over the running of QRPHONE/1. (1)RPHONE/1 subsequently was
   instructed to stop pursuing his SMORANGE targets.)

6. Thus JELANCE is stymied. The question is whether there is
   anything that can be done to improve the situation. The one new factor
   in the equation that possibly could be used to reopen the discussion
   with a view to amcliorating the situation is the fact that there now
   is a different IDEN than when the February 1970 SMOTH explanation was
   offered. Even though JAGUAR has not specifically given that explana-
   tion,. to JELANCE, the Station, without reference to SMOTH's explana-
   tion presumably could elect to reopen the discussion in terms of a
   possible change of atmosphere since the change of IDEN. Such a dis-
   cussion at least should give an indication of whether SMOTH's explana-
   fion is JAGUAR's (and JKLANCE's) major obstacle.

7. Were QRPHONE/1 permitted to resume his London contacts he
   could obtain some information of the type JKLANCE would like to get
   from JAGUAR. But, in view of the June 1970 SIUPSILON-approved SMOVID
   demarche to JADWIN, it might be unwise, for the moment at least, to
   sound out JAGUAR about reactivating QRPHONE/l. he would appreciate
   receiving London Station's views on this subject.

8. One final point that should be noted is that MCGRILLEN, in
   forwarding the above-mentioned JAGUAR report on 24 December 1970,
   mentioned that visiting ZIBET officer Jeremy R. FREYMARK recently had
   discussed these JKLANCE requirements in London with SMOVID, SMENDIVE
   end SMEVICT and that it was MCGRILLEN's understanding that "it was
   generally agreed to limit our requests in the future to selected
   targets on which there is evidence of coup plotting or subversion."
   MCGRILLEN added that he looked forward to any followup questions based
   on the above criteria that Headquarters wanted the Station to submit to
   JAGUAR. FREYMARK's recollection of his talks with JAGUAR is at slight
   variance with NCGRILLEN's account. FREYMARK recalls that he had agreed
   to limit JKLANCE's future requests to those cases in which JKLANCE had
   an active interest and where there was good reason to suspect a real
   threat to the stability of the African country against which the London-
   based African sight be acting. Accordingly, there is attached a select
   list of individuals about whose contacts and activities JKLANCE would
   like to have updated information from JAGUAR. The type of information
   yo desire is indicated by the illustrative questions and other data
   in support of our request. Whereas we would like to have unsolicited
   and regular, reporting on these targets, we realize that JAGUAR is not
   equipped or prepared to accept such a continuing requirement. te believe
   that the attached list along with the paragraph five discussion pegged
   to a change of IDENS are good pegs for GIBSON or his designee in re-
   gpening the discussion with JAGUAR.

Sir/Madam

I am directed by the Secretary of State to inform you that he is now prepared to remove the restrictions on your stay in this country. The conditions attached to it have therefore been cancelled.

Cancellation of conditions means that you are now also exempt from the requirement to report changes of address and other particulars to the police.

There is now no necessity for you to obtain permission from a government Department to take employment in Great Britain. The Secretary of State would, moreover, have no objection if you wished to establish yourself in business or a profession, but it should be clearly understood that this does not relieve you of the obligation, in that event, to conform to any regulations governing the business or professional activities in which you may be interested.

This cancellation of your conditions does not extend to the Channel Islands which have their own laws relating to aliens. You should therefore consult the Immigration

Authorities of the island concerned if at any time you contemplate going there to live.

This cancollation of conditions extends to Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man only as far as residence is concerned. If you are going to take work in either place, you will have to consult the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Social Services or the Employment Division, Government Office, Isle of Man.

Your passport and police registration certificate have been endorsed and are returned herewith. The endorsement in the registration certificate shows that you are now exempt from registration.

I am Sir/Madam
Your obedient Sorvant

AGENT EVALUATION

NAME: QRPHONE/1

DATE: 18 January 1971

PROJECT: QRPHONE

STATUS: Contract Agent (Under a Memerardum of Oral Agreement)

OVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: International correspondent for "Sunday supplement" type color magazine distributed by twenty major newspapers in the U.S. Also represents owner of this color magazine in other of his business ventures in Europe. This overt job was assumed in December 1970. Prior to that, Q/1 was the London representative of small U.S. news service. Q/1 does free lance journalism and is an occasional contributor to several magazines and newspapers.

COVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left, including Maoist, African liberation, and Palestinian groups. Q/1's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and without posing problems for his handler. His personality is easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not always totally successful -- leaving us with tantalizing bits of information and many unanswered questions -- this is generally due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job as a journalist. He has acquitted himself well both as a representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity. Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and in this connection the operation profits particularly from the energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: QRPHONE/1's attitude is positive. (See below under Motivation.)

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/l's attitude is good. He has made an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement with enthusiasm.

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on which a good deal has beensaid over the course of this operation. The following points can be made on the subject of Q/l's motivation:

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 95

B. This image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional organization has been enhanced in Q/l's case by the circumstances of his agent relationship, which require very professional handling. Indeed Q/1 has probably come to hold a rather glamorous "storybook" image of JKLANCE and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE effort. This is a very human trait and should not be exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti- JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of a very impressive outfit.

C. In his political evolution over the years, Q/1 has become active in at least two "causes". In both instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally harmed as a result. The product of this situation has been a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political outlook. (In other circumstances this might be called political maturity.) Q/1 now tends to view political trends as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D. Following on the foregoing thought is the fact that he is an American (and does not consider himself disloyal). Given his citizenship and his disinclination to feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE to report on those currents. He does not give any indication that he views this as "squealing" on his friends -- indeed the contrary seems to be the case.

E. On a more mundane level, it must be realized that Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial straits. He was without a job and was living off the charity of his wife's family. JKLANCE has given him a job, paid him reasonably well and regularly, and has enabled him to be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F. Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1 clearly likes his work. He enjoys dealing with international issues and political subjects. He enjoys the travel and the opportunity to exercise his language capability. In short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which he has been able to live appeals to him.

G. In assessing the relative importance of these several factors which make up Q/1's motivation, the under- signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more underlying. Band F have arisen since recruitment and probably play an important role in his current motivation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 96

# SECRET

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Q/l's wife is not witting of his
JKLANCE affiliation. She was allowed to believe that he was
working indirectly for the Chinese. She certainly is aware
of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at
Q/1, but as far as 1 can determine (and this is not a subject
on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she
continues to accept the Chinese story. It should be added
that Mrs. Q/1 is British and is the holder of some rather
typical "left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should also be noted
that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety
of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.
Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activities is one which
Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed
lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that
Mrs. Q/1 seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of
money received from Q/l's cover and to regard this as a genuine
stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant
personality and responds well to Case Officer handling. He is
a most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other
than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a
sensitive asset such as Q/1.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to
accept guidance and criticism -- provided it is constructive.
If anything, he may sometimes be too willing. His willingness
occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls
to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational
considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.
However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon
him. In this connection it should be recalled that his ability
to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his
relationship with his informants; i.e., since he is only eliciting
the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to
press for all the desired details.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has
signed recruitment documents and a security pledge. We hasten
to add that Q/1 is not a handling problem and there has never
been any instance in which either he or his handler has had
occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q/1 has a good sense of personal security and his
handler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.
As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure
to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

SECRET


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 97

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of Q/l's affiliation with JKLANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment, add an extra dimension to Q/l's cover situation. We have no indication that any of these allegations are based on any proof, nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of contacts.

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/l is a self-starter and can work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative burden. He is not overly concerned about his administrative and financial position, allowances, payments, etc. He merely expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected, he can be very upset.

REPORTING: Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective reporter -- both in terms of ability to elicit and writing style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANCE: Q/1 is quite energetic and can continue his efforts on a sustained basis.

LANGUAGES: In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French, Italian and German.

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel and even enjoys it!

AREA KNOWLEDGE: Q/1 is quite widely travelled in Europe and Africa and consequently has acquitted an extensive area knowledge.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Q/l's present operating context does not provide an adequate basis to evaluate these talents. It is assumed that he has a satisfactory competence in both these areas, however.

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses, either personal or professional which inhibit his operational use. The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts is a definite limitation on his employment.

CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Q/1 has mentioned to his handler that he hopes to be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE. He enjoys the work and presumably the financial security. However,


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 98

the combination of the security factors operative in this case and the unlikelihood of Q/l's continued access to targets of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being regarded as a career asset.

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this agent, and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as of the Case Officer.

I doubt that we have really divined Q/l's motivations for working with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab we can make at this enigmatic subject.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Covert Action Staff

ATTENTION: Miss Diane Chatelan

SUBJECT: Completion of Training Report for ORPHONE/1 (P), Training Alias: PERSHING

REFERERICE: Memorandum for Director of Training dated 28 September 1970, Attention: Chief, Covert Training/CS/TR, Subject: Covert Training for CRPHONE/1, From: Deputy Chief, Covert Action Staff

1. CRPHONE/1 was trained covertly in New York on 14, 15, 16 October 1970. There were twelve hours of training in the three sessions.

2. In accordance with the reference training request and discussions between the instructor and the two Case Officers, QRPHONE/1 was given a concentrated dosage of reporting instruction with emphasis on spotting and assessment reports.

3. QRPHONE/1 is a professional writer, so there was no problem in the writing department. The need was for channelling the writing capabilities of this man who has been an Agent for five years, into our type of reporting and to end his "stream of consciousness" style of reporting, as one Case Officer put it.

4. GRPHONE/1 quite quickly got into the spirit of the training and by the end of the first session was obviously enjoying it and appreciating the opportunity to learn to write our way. He pointed out that his big problem is having to retain substantial amounts of information in his head for two or three weeks, then put it all down the night before he meets his Case Officer. From his conversation, it appeared that organizing a report had never occurred to him before and he several times said "no one ever told me about this", "this is the first I've learned of this, etc." These things were said in happiness at having discovered ways of improving his reporting and simultaneously making his reporting less of a chore and more of a joy.

5. In organizing a report exercise, he did extremely well. In exercises separating fact from inference, he did only fairly well, considering his background and compared to trainees with no where near his experience or education. He has a slight tendency toward jumping to conclusions and reading meanings into words. He realized this and from then on he overcame this weakness to a considerable degree. However, even on the last day, writing reports based on New York Times newspaper articles, he twice (out of five reports) substituted his own word for a word in the article for no valid reason and which new word in fact changed the meaning of the sentence, though only slightly.

6. This small weakness is not unique to QRPHC3/1. It is also true of other equally highly literate trainees, who, like QRPICE/1, unconsciously substitute their own language for that which has been directly given to them, not realizing that they thereby sometimes change this meaning of that which they are reporting. Happily, QAFIONE/1 realized this during the exercises, recognized the changed meaning, and earnestly stated that he will watch it in the future.

7. In observation and description exercises, he did well after a rocky start. Here, he at first concentrated on individuals, almost completely ignoring the actions they were engaged in. He soon saw that he has a mental capacity to watch both at once and there was no problem thereafter.

8. He was excellent in his ability to separate hard facts and put those in the body of his reports while listing as comments those items which legitimately were comments and which had no place in the report itself.

9. For the final session, he had been asked to do assessment reports on two people. He was mortified when he came in on the last morning, happily handed in his five intel reports and suddenly realized that he had completely forgotten to do the other reports. However, in discussing spotting and assessment reports, it appears that he now understands them.

10. In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the training, we would appreciate a detailed evaluation report in November 1971 from the field station. This report should indicate the extent to which the training has made the trainee a more useful and effective asset and should evaluate the performance in each area of tradecraft in which training was conducted; negative as well as positive comments are solicited. The field station's report should also include the trainee's own comments. Please ask the field station to slug the report WOHOLD/QRFICE/1/PERSHING. Upon receipt of the report at Headquarters, please forward a copy to the undersigned.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Training

ATTENTION: Chief, Covert Training/OS/TR

SUBJECT: Covert Training for ORPHONE/1

1. This is to confirm telophone conversation between Mr.
   Caleb L. Batton and Miss Diane L. Chatelan, Chief, Counter
   Front Branch, requesting covert training for subject contract
   agent.

2. We would like to have this trailing begin 14 October
   1970, and can make the agent available full time for three days
   only. We are planning to have the training take place in New
   York City, and Mr. Lasarus has already indicated orally to Miss
   Chatelan that he will be available.

3. Our mala objective is to provide CRPHONE/1 with a
   firm understanding of what is required for good intelligence
   reporting and also the skills needed for spotting and assessments.
   ORPHONE/1 has been an Agent for over five years and has
   absorbed a good deal of tradecraft in the process. He has not,
   however, had any formally organised training.

4. We would like to have ORPHONE/L's outside case officer
   (handler) present during this training.

5. Subject and his operational background represent a highly
   sensitive area and we would appreciate the selection of a training
   site with this in mind. Biographic background as needed by your
   Instructor will be provided by Chief, CA/CF with whom all further
   arrangements for this training should be made.

TO: ID/1 23 September 1970

FROM: Interrogation Research Division

SUBJECT: Richard Thomas GIBSON IRD# 54454
201-306052

## BACKGROUND:

Subject is a 39-year-old, married, male U.S. citizen who has been utilized by this organization since 1966 as a covert action asset. He was granted a POA on 23 May 1966. His previous polygraph examination was on 13 June 1965.

## PROCEDURE:

On 21 September 1970, Subject was interrogated and given a polygraph examination in a Commodore Hotel suite in New York City which was used as a covert site. Subject's interrogation and examination were conducted in the English language.

## PURPOSE:

The examination was requested through Miss Diana Chatelin of the CA Staff. ADDP approval was granted for the examination. The examination was conducted in order to determine if Subject had revealed his covert relationship with this organization, whether or not Subject had been approached by any other intelligence organization seeking his cooperation, whether or not Subject was maintaining a secret relationship with any other organization, whether or not Subject was deliberately withholding any contacts which he has developed from this organization, and whether or not Subject is currently subject to blackmail or other direct forms of coercion.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 106

IRD# 54454

CONCLUSION:
Subject's polygraph examination did not contain any Indica- tion of deception to any of the above listed specific areas of inquiry.

FROM
Chief, LCPIPIT London

SUBJECT
DTDORIC/Operational
ORPHONE/Verges

For the record we are forwarding, u/s/c, a copy of the letter to QRPHONE/1 from his Paris lawyer which outlines the status of QRPHONE/1's action against Jacques Verges. As Headquarters will recall this letter was used by QRPHONE/1 to good advantage in connection with his recent trip to Algiers. The letter says, in effect, that Verges has proposed a settlement of the matter and has agreed to pay this settlement in Algerian dinars. Needless to say, QRPHONE/1 has yet to receive payment. Nevertheless QRPHONE/l's purposes are well served by this attestation of Verges' expressed willingness to pay, with its implied admission of guilt!

Cher Monsieur,

Je vous confirme l'entretien téléphonique que nous avons eu au sujet de votre affaire.

A de nombreuses reprises, Maître VERGES a proposé de régler votre affaire et notamment le ler juillet 1967 ce que j'ai accepté immédiatement - de vous régler ainsi qu'à votre ferme en dinars, lors de votre premier voyage en Algérie, une somme équivalente à la moitié de vos demandes respectives.

J'ai vu dans le cadre de nos pourparlers, la proposition manuscrite de Maître VERGES, dont les termes sont assez fidèlement reproduits ci-dessus.

A plusieurs reprises, Maître CAIN m'a confirmé l'accord de Maître VERGES pour régler sur ces bases ; toutefois ces derniers mois, il m'a fait savoir qu'il ne l'avait pas revu depuis un certain temps.

Pour vous permettre de discuter utilement avec Maître VERGES, si vous le rencontrez, je vous rappelle le montant des deux demandes :

1°) pour vous-même : salaire : 4.500 Fr -
préavis : 9.000 Fr -
congés payés : 1.500 Fr -

Il est demandé en outre un certificat de travail, des fiches de paye et la régularisation de votre situation à l'égard de la Sécurité Sociale.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 124

Je pense que vous abandonnez ces trois derniers postes qui n'ont aucun intérêt pour vous, je crois.

2) pour votre épouse: salaire : 4.500 fr
   préavis: 4.500 Fr
   congés payés: 1.500 fr

Il est en outre demandé des fiches de paye et la régularisation à l'égard de la Sécurité Sociale. Ces deux derniers postes me semblent sans intérêt, comme pour vous-même.

Je pense donc que vous pourriez demander à Me VERGES de remplir les engagements qu'il a pris à votre égard, savoir paiement de la somme de 12.750 fr français (convertis en dinars.

Merci de me tenir au courant.

Veuillez, je vous prie, transmettre mes amitiés à votre épouse.

J'espère avoir le plaisir de votre visite lors de votre retour en Angleterre.

Je vous prie de croire, cher Monsieur, à l'expression de mes sentiments dévoués.

1958

Q/1 worked for Agence France Presse - Paris. He was discharged by AFP when Ollie Harrington (American negro) brought forgery charges against him.

Q/1 sent to a weekly American publication and to to the British daily *The Observer*, over the signature of O. Harrington, with violently anti-French articles which were printed and could have brought about the expulsion of author, William G. Smith (still in Paris), Richard Wright (deceased) widow still living in Paris and John Flint all took sides with Harrington.

30 July 1964. Accusations received from unidentified Americans, members of USA CP reportedly forward to Verges, editor of *Revolution* certain documents which established Q/1 was working on behalf of CIA. This was because of fight over money that was due Q/1 and his wife. (Q/1 had his lawyer bring suit against Verges and finally in 1969 Verges agreed to pay certain amount and also an apology. This Q/1 can use to counteract the accusations by Verges.

Fall 1966 FBI Report: Source recently advised that during the Fall 1966, a member of an Italian pro-Chinese Marxist Leninist Organization stated that Subject was suspected of being a spy for CIA. This person reported this to Rene Raindorf a member of the Jacques Grippa Pro Chinese Belgian CP.

Feb. SINIC: a London publication of leftist orientation, carried an article mentioning Q/1 by name and stating that he is widely believed to be an CIA agent. (Two of the Four persons listed as contributors to SINIC were at the Algiers Palestine Solidarity Meeting which Q/1 attended in Dec. 1969.

They were members of the British delegation representing the Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC) which was a rival delegation to that led by A.

IMPORT TO WHICH AGENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAKE

LIVE PRODUCTION: ORPHONE/1 has responded
with energy and enthusiasm. He has fulfilled
maximum degree feasible - given the limitations
by the unwilling informant-type solution.
Despite every effort by ORPHONE/1 so

During the quarter QRPHONE/1 was the source of

5. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS LEVIED UPON AGENT:
   will follow-up on his access to the Arab/Palestinian study
   attempt to cultivate leaders in this cause - both European and Arab -
   with the objective of taking a trip to the Mid-East (Cairo, Amman, Damascus,
   Beirut).

ORPHONE/1's postponed trip to the U.S. has been condemned
for April (in the next quarter).

ORPHONE/1 will re-visit Italy, per Rome
look at the activities and attitudes of the

ORPHONE/1 will continue his development of
erational interest in London.

6. AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO ASSIGNMENTS AND DUTIES. 2
   PERSONAL SECURITY, ETC.: ORPHONE/1's response
   performance, continues to be enthusiastic
   made in previous quarterly (and other reports
   LCPIPIT and RODIGAST are able to judge.

7. AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER AND
   REPORTING TECHNIQUE: ORPHONE/1 has a very
   relates easily to others. This is a positive asset
   information from his many contacts and also
   and uncomplicated experience. ORPHONE/1
   including direction and criticism - well received - in a constructive vein
   same holds true of critique of his reporting.

8. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTER, INCLUDING PROMOTION
   funding the bulk of ORPHONE/1's salary to his Swiss bank
   and will be put into operation in January. This will ease back the problem
   problems OF BIRNEE - which were cited in previous reports.

An increase in salary of $100 per month has been approved for ORPHONE/1
This will be effective 1 January and will be paid into an escrow-type
arrangement in order that it not increase ORPHONE/1's standard of living.

9. GENERAL COMMENTS ON AGENT PERFORMANCE: ORPHONE/1 is an excellent asset.
   He has performed well and effectively against his targets.

10. ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS OF EFFORT:
    effort to gain useful access to the Palestinian
    gressing well. In subsequent quarters we will see whether or not
    progress can be maintained.

The progress toward operationally useful contact with Tony and Malcolm
(Phombeah and Kambona) is painfully slow. In this - as in all other sit-
uations - the problem is mainly the nature of ORPHONE/1's access to him.

contacts (that of an unwitting informant). We feel that given this situation ORPHONE/1 is doing as well as might reasonably że expected.

OEP 858 was a much appreciated analysis of ORPHONE/1's recent reporting on the Italian target and explained why much of this has not been judged disseminable. Having reflected on this we realize that this is actually not surprising. It should be recalled that Rome Station specifically requested that ORPHONE/1 get away from rigid formal CS-type reporting and render more opinionated journalistic type reports. This type of reporting has been juōged quite useful by Rome Station but it is useful in an operational manner and for general appreciation of the situation. Thus it was not surprising that an analysis of this particular group of reports turned out as it did. Rome Station has orally noted to LCPIPIT that ORPHONE/l's visits will continue to be welcome and his reporting of definite use - even if this utility is outside the CS framework.

In general we feel that this operation is progressing well. In the past there may have been a tendancy on the part of certain "customers" to exaggerate QRPHONE/1's potential - with a consequent lot-down when the realities of ORPHONE/1 the man and his access to targets was brought home. We now feel that this is behind us. Judged against the realities of his situation, his access and the nature of his targets, we think that QRPHONE/1 makes excellent progress against those targets assigned him.

SUBJ: STODORIC/Operational/MHPROBE ORPHONE/Passport

1.  At their most recent meeting QRPHONE/1 reported to RODIGAST that he had lost his passport in Paris during his recent visit to France. The loss occurred on 8 November in the departure lounge at Orly Airport as QRPHONE/1 was waiting to board AF 822 for London (leaving at 1755 hours). QRPHONE/1 had shown his passport to the immigration officials when he entered the lounge. He then went to the duty free shop to purchase a bottle of Scotch and a carton of cigarettes for his wife (she smokes Galoises). He presumes that his passport slipped from his pocket during the process of producing his wallet to pay for these items. At any rate he did not discover the loss until the flight was airborne.

2.  QRPHONE/1 had no difficulty re-entering Britain using his Home Office Certificate of Registration. He reported the loss to Air France immediately but as of his meeting with RODIGAST on 13 November it had not been located.

3.  On 10 November QRPHONE/1 went to the U.S. Embassy in London and obtained a new passport (the number of this passport is IDENTITY - u/s/c).

4.  We advised CHALEMSKY, of Paris Station, of this loss during his visit to LCPIPIT on 14 November.

7 NOV 1969

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, CA Staff

SUBJECT: LCPIPIT Request for QRPHONE/1 Salary Increase

REFERENCE: OEPA - 2122

1. The following is a breakdown of ORPHONE/1's salary history:

Starting salary, June 1965 $600 per month
1 September 1966 $700 per month
1 July 1967 $800 per month

All of the above figures are tax free. In addition, as of 1 May 1969, Subject was given an additional $50 per month (also tax free) as our contribution toward some form of insurance against the future (endowment, lump sum cash valus, or whatever the Field and he finally selected). This appears on the books as a salary increase. However, although to his ultimate advantage, It does result in a small decrease in take-home pay since Qil is also required to make a contribution to the payment of the premium.

2. In addition, Q/1's MOC also provides for $10,000 indemnification in case of death, or payment of $600 per month up to $10,000 to his wife in case of his total Incapacitation or disappearance while employed by CIA. Allowance had originally been made for this provision when he seemed to have an excellent chance for travel to Peking; this year we included the provision as a general benefit, not tied to any particular type of hazardous travel alone. Finally, this year's amendment to his MOC also included a severance bonus of one month's salary for each year of satisfactory service. We placed $3,200 in a special escrow account to cover his previous four years' service, and are providing in our Project renewals for each year's required deposit to that escrow account. Please note, however, that this benefit has not yet been surfaced either to ORPHONE/1 or to RODIGAST, by decision of LCPIPIT (a decision which I believe was wise).

3. It is my feeling that the proposed salary Increase of $250 tax free per month is way out of line. I believe that paragraph 3 of the reference, comparing Q/1 with a hypothetical GS-12 is a rather specious and unrealistic argument. Q/1, although an American, is an agent, and nothing more, and as you note in your penciled comment the question of quarters, allowances, and periodic step increases is not relevant. In addition, while I do not subscribe

to some of the criticisms that have been leveled at his production, the fact remains that I have not seen any marked improvement during the past two years in the quality of the material he provides us. As time goes on and the realistic criteria of what is disseminable and what is not are applied more and more to his production, and this production in turn remains at its present level of superficiality, we will see less and less of it qualify for dissemination. Since he is an FI agent, this has considerable significance, although it of course does not present the full picture of his capabilities. His operational intelligence has been received with mixed evaluations; usually his initial coverage of a subject is very well received and often whets the appetite of the recipient for more; somehow, however, that "more" never seems to materialize -- they get more of exactly the same caliber, but little more in terms of depth of reporting. Perhaps the fault lies in ORPHONE/1, in which case we should realize early that what we have here is not a true FI agent, but a sort of "operational intelligence butterfly." Perhaps, on the other hand, the fault lies in RODIGAST's handling of the man, not in terms of the personal relationship which RODIGAST has been able to build up with him, but maybe even because of that relationship. I remember when I first talked with RODIGAST I quickly realized that he felt he knew more than Headquarters as to what was important for Q/1 to cover and what was not; I am sorry I missed RODIGAST on his TDY here and when I was in London, and that his home leave has been postponed, for I had hoped to determine for myself whether RODIGAST still felt that way. Whatever the reason, I am by no means giving up on O/1, but will continue to try to narrow down his targets so that he will have a fair shake at showing what he can do when he is not allowed to cover the waterfront.

4. What the above paragraph is leading up to, is that I do not in all honesty feel that he has done anything to really deserve a promotion, except build longevity since the last one, and perhaps not follow up (actively) on that newspaper job offered to him (his preference, in any event). However, I do realize that a man must have an incentive, and would like to propose that we suggest to LCPIPIT that a more realistic increase might be in the neighborhood of $100 a month, and that the severance bonus mentioned in paragraph 2 above might now be surfaced both to RODIGAST and to Q/l as a new benefit.

5. Attached for your ready reference is a copy of the ORPHONE quarterly report for 1 April to 30 June 1969; this is the last one we have received.

# QUARTERLY REPORT

STATION/BASE : LCPIPIT (London)
PROJECT : ORPHONE
AGENT'S CRYPT : QRPHONE/1
DATE OF POA/OA: 23 May 1966
PERIOD COVERED : 1 July-30 September 1969
COSTS : $4,33414 (Field Costs Only):
CASE OFFICER TIME: 12 working days per month (average)

## 1. SUMMARY OF OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING PERIOD:

Pursuant to plans developed as a result of Marie R. LUEBBERT'S TDY, QRPHONE/1 made a continuing effort to deepen his contacts with various African personalities connected with the "London group". Although some progress has been made with persons who seem of secondary importance, QRPHONE/1 still is unable to gain the confidence of the central characters such as Dennis Phombeah and Oscar Kambona.

QRPEONY's one week stay in the U.K. was a week of intense activity for QRPHONE/1 and saw his local "credentials" put to a most demanding test. ORPHONE/1 performed extremely well throughout the week. See OELA - 51297 for details.

QRPHONE/1 has been able to monitor the activity of Belgian Communist Rene Raindorf who is attempting to become a key figure in the Palestinian liberation movement. See OEPA - 2037, 2099 and 2123.

Following an overature from a U.S. newspaper QRPHONE/1 made a quick trip to New York to consult with Headquarters officers regarding the implications of this overature on his RVROCK status. See LCPIPIT 4222 and DIRECTOR 28728 for details.

Through two unwitting female informants QRPHONE/1 was able to obtain reporting on the Algiers Cultural Festival. See OELA - 51298.

ORPHONE/1 has continued his monitoring of the activity of various African liberation movement figures in London.

## 2. SPECIFIC MATTERS OF OPERATIONAL SECURITY AND COVER:

QRPHONE/1's vacation in Italy with his family produced a marked improvement in his domestic situation - with its consequent impact upon the cover and security of the entire operation. This remains a matter of concern and one which will be carefully monitored.

QRPURE is now entering into a more meaningful overt correspondence with QRPHONE/1, including discussions of his participation in the now magazino. This will have a positive impact upon QRPHONE/1's cover as a representative of QRPURE.

A new means of funding QRPHONE/1's salary is being sought to replace BIKNEE, which is no longer functioning due to unrelated problems encountered by the principal agent of that operation. For a review of the security implications of this matter (which are thought to be minimal) please see DIRECTOR 46178.

## 3. ESTIMATE OF AGENT'S CONTINUED DEGREE OF ACCESS TO TARGETS:

QRPHONE/1's access to his various targets remains substantially unchanged.

## 4. EXTENT TO WHICH AGENT HAS BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE ASSIGNMENTS, INCLUDING INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION:

QRPHONE/1 has approached all his assignments with enthusiasm and energy. He has fulfilled these assignments to the maximum


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 147

degree feasible - given his cover and the unwitting informant-type nature
of his relationship with his many contacts. QRPHONE/1makes every effort.
to overcome this limitation and in this regard a plentiful supply of back-
ground information greatly facilitates his elicitation of added details
from his informants. However, this limitation is one which will always
be with us in the case of QRPHONE/1 and it is one which can sometimes be
particularly frustrating. During the past quarter QRPHONE/1 has been the
source of 11 intelligence reports prepared by LCPIPIT/Reports.

5. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS LEVIED UPON AGENT FOR ENSUING PERIOD: ORPHONE/1
   will make a trip to Italy in late September and early October in order to
   survey the situation within the Italian new left/radical sector. This
   trip is one which has been requested by Rome Station. (The trip will have
   been completed by the time this report is received by licadquarters.)

QRPHONE/1's contact with an official of the Eritrean Liberation Front led
to a TDY by AF Division officer Geoffrey B. DRANSTON to brief LCPIPIT on
the ELF and to discuss possible operational exploitation of this contact.

QRPHONE/1's trip to the United States has been deferred until spring 1970
by which time any possible repercussions from QRPEONY's return will be
relatively unlikely.

An effort will be made to explore the operational possibilities posed by
QRPHONE/1's existing (or potential) contacts within the Arab liberation
movements. Headquarters views on this matter were requested in OEPA-2044.

A re-scheduling of QRPHONE/1's trip to Germany has been proposed and
Headquarters and Bonn have been asked for guidance/requirements.

6. AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO ASSIGNMENTS LEVIED INCLUDING MOTIVATION,
   PERSONAL SECURITY, ETC.: QRPHONE/1's response to assignments, like his
   performance, continues to be enthusiastic and energetic. The comments
   made in previous quarterly reporting regarding his security and motivation
   remain valid insofar as RODIGAST and LCPIPIT are able to judge.

7. AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING OR CRITIQUE OF HIS
   REPORTING TECHNIQUE: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant personality and re-
   lates easily to others. This is a positive factor in his elicitation of
   information from his many contacts and also makes dealing with him a
   pleasant and uncomplicated experience. QRPHONE/1 accepts case officer
   handling - including direction and criticism well and in a constructive
   vein. The same holds true of critique of his reporting. Please see pre-
   vious reporting on this subject for added details.

8. ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, INCLUDING PROMOTIONS, TRAINING: A new means of
   funding QRPHONE/1's salary is now being devised. This has been the subject
   of several items of correspondence between Headquarters and LCPIPIT. We
   plan to consult with the SGFLAG representative in Bern on this matter.

QRPHONE/1 has had some purely overt problems with his Chicago bank (an
apparent error in his statement, etc.) He is also being charged very high
service charges for the performance of routine transfers. If he is noť
able to resolve his problems with this bank it may be necessary for him
to change banks.

At LCPIPIT's insistance QRPHONE/1 has begun to invest a portion of his
monthly salary in a reputable Mutual Fund of his choice. This modest
investment program will enhance his financial security in the event of
termination and/or a rainy day".

SUBJECT

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

1.  As previously reported, we related to JAGUAR the incident in which Lionel Morrison is believed to have searched QRPHONE's papers while the latter was out of town.
    As you know, there have been some indications in the past which might be taken to suggest that Morrison was a JAGUAR contact - he works for the Daily Telegraph and seems to be in touch with David Floyd, and on one occasion provided QRPHONE with a report (on QRPEONY) which came almost simultaneously from JAGUAR. Clearly, this does not add up to much of a case, and we could hardly conceive that JAGUAR would be involved in the harrassment of QRPHONE. Even if there was no JAGUAR contact with Morrison, however, we felt it might be possible that JAGUAR could add to our understanding of this peculiar development from sources available to their own net. JAGUAR's reply is as follows (CORONET is the agreed crypt for QRPHONE):

"With reference to your letter of 24th April 1969,
we have been informed by a secret and delicate source
that David M. SIBEKO, the newly appointed P.A.C. rep-
resentative in London, has recently been told by Elias
NTLOEDIBE, the P.A.C. representative in Nairobi, of the
incident of MORRISON's search of CORONET's papers.
According to Elias, MORRISON had written him a letter
in an attempt to blackmail him. Elias told SIBEKO that
what annoyed him was that MORRISON had sent photostat
copies of Elias's own correspondence with CORONET.

"Elias went on to say he was satisfied that MORRISON
must have had covert access to CORONET's personal effects.
Elias was surprised that CORONET had not replied to letters

A substantial increase in QRPHONE/l's salary has been requested by LCPIPIT. We have further proposed that this increase be paid into an, escrow-type account. See OEPA - 2122 for details.

9. GENERAL COMMENTS ON OVERALL AGENT PERFORMANCE: QRPHONE/1's overall performance has been superior.

he had written to him about the A.N.C. and enclosing press cuttings. He has asked SIBEKO fo find out if CORONET got those letters, and to warn CORONET that MORRISON or someone acting for him has been stealing mail from his (CORONET's) house.

"Elias speculates that the spy, whoever he is, may be working for Black Power or Marxist/Leninists or The Telegraph or even M.1.5., and wants CORONET told of this."

"Elias has written to MORRISON telling him to go to hell and that he (Elias) and his friends will stand by SIBEKO."

"Elias has said that he held no brief for CORONET, but he notes that CORONET was introduced to the party by MORRISON and that in June 1968, MORRISON wrote an article in the Zambian Mail describing CORONET as a great Afro/American and a great revolutionary."

"According to Elias, CORONET was then living in London and he recalls that there was correspondence between CORONET and MORRISON at that time; and that CORONET used to supply MORRISON with pocket money. SIBEKO wonders when MORRISON began to work for CIA and infers that he and his friends should no longer be taken in by the 'coloureds.'

"In view of the delicacy of the source I should be grateful if the above information is not passed on to CORONET."

2. This reply does not of course answer all our questions, but it does seem to be in accord with what we know of the incident from QRPHONE. It seems reasonable to attribute Morrison's actions to factional fending with PAC - a crossfire in which QRPHONE happened to be caught.

SUBJECT:
MHMUTUAL Escrow Account for CRPHONE/

1. It is requested that an MHMUTUAL interest-bearing escrow account be set up in an appropriate alias for agent CRPHONE/L. In accordance with an amendment to the agent's MOC concerning a severance bonus, the account is intended to accommodate annual payments of one month's salary for every completed year of satisfactory service. The initial deposit consists of $3,200, retroactively covering four years' service and computed at the rate of $800 per year. Additional deposits, in the amount of the agent's salary on the anniversary date of his contractual relationship (1 June), will be made annually to his account on or about that date.

2. Any additional questions that might arise may be taken up with Chief, CA/CF, or with Miss Ann Jane Long.

SUBJECT DTDORIC/Operational
ORPHONE/Switzerland

1. As addressees are aware QRPHONE/1 has officially been denied entry into Switzerland since 16 December 1963. This order was issued in connection with his employment with Identity A, which was then receiving money from the Chinese--in violation of Swiss neutrality. A similar order was also issued at that time for Identity B, who was the Editor of Identity A.

2. It is now some six years later and QRPHONE/1 (at least overtly) is employed as a legitimate journalist. He is not a member of any group which is proscribed by the Swiss authorities--although, of course, he maintains contact with a wide variety of leftist individuals in puruit of his operational tasks. QRPHONE/1 has noted that Identity B has been allowed back into Switzerland--in connection with his defense of Arab terrorists and feels that if the Swiss are willing to do this for Identity B then they should also lift the ban on his entry into Switzerland. QRPHONE/1 obviously feels personally about this, and it may be that future operational benefit could be gained if QRPHONE/1 were again able to enter Switzerland.

3. We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of a report written by QRPHONE/1 following his contact with the Swiss Embassy in London on this matter. We are also forwarding under separate cover a copy of the letter which he sent the Embassy in which he formally states his request that the entry ban be lifted.

4. You will note that the Swiss Embassy suggested that QRPHONE/1 work through the U.S. Embassy on this matter. We have told QRPHONE/1 not to do this, but rather to deal directly with the Swiss. If he needs certification of his status as a working journalist we suggested that QRPHONE/1 obtain this from the appropriate professional organization (of which he is a member) in London.

5. We presume that the Swiss Embassy in London will be forwarding QRPHONE/1's letter to Bern. We will appreciate being advised of any Swiss action, or statements, on this case which may come to the attention of Bern Station. Any advice which Bern Station can offer regarding QRPHONE/1's pursuit of this matter will be welcome.

6. Of course Bern Station should continue to be guided by the contents of DIRECTOR-69543 in any dealings with the Swiss concerning QRPHONE/1.

SWISS ETRY BAN PROBLEM

On 15 April 1969, I spoke with Charles Henry Brugzzann,
First Secretary at the Swiss Embassy in London and who
handles press affairs, by phone. I tried to arrange a persoral
meeting with Bruggnan, who insisted on knowing the exact
nature of my business with him. He clained there vas
nothing he could do for me in London, except to forward
a letter from ne through channels to the proper authorities
in Berne. (I later sent hin such a letter.) Bragiann
urged me to work through the U.S. State Department, which
could take up the matter through the Embassy in Berne. If
the U.S. Embassy would only vouch for me as a processioral
journalist, Bruggnann added, I would be almost certain to
get the ban lifted.

Naturally, I have made no efforts to contact anyone at
the Embassy in London, but perhaps something night be
done to get the Embassy in Berne to acknowledgo at least,
when queried by the Swiss, that I am a bonafiče journalist
in the employ of a reputable U.S. nows and features agency?

17th April, 1969.

Mr. Charles Henry Braggmann,
First Secretary,
Embassy of Switzerland,
77/81 Gloucester Place,
London, .1.

Dear Sir,

Following our telephone conversation & few days co,
I am now writing formolly to you to request that the bon
on my entry into Switzerland be lifted. This ben, whici.
dates from 1963, was never porconally directed against re
but against the publication for which I was then working
as an Editor. That publication, 'African Revolution', no
longer exists and I note that its forner Algerien publisher,
Me Jacques Verges now visits Switzerland frequently. In
any case I am now in no way connected with kin.

As you know, I am the overseas representative and
correspondent, based in London, of Negro Press Intern:tion: 1,
the major Kegro news and features agency in the United States,
which serves some 270 newspapers. This is a bonariaco
commercial journalistic enterprise and serves no political
purpose. I personally a & mencer of the lorein Press
Association and the Association of American Correspondents
in London and an accredited to the Forcin and Commonwealti.
Office Lere.

It is part of my duties to report on the activities
of the United Fations and its agencies. I have been, for
many years, accredited at United Kations Headquarters in
New York and I was also an accredited correspondent at the
founding conference in Geneva of UNCTAD. Many important
meetings are scheduled to be held in Geneva during this-jerr
and I have been acked by my fira to cover these confernce.
Therefore, I ask your consideration and cooperation in

it odd that he was being treated in that fashion and
suspect that the Home Office was aware of his role which
would not help your relationship with him. Alternatively

felt that the obvious answer was (b) i.e. an extension of

Chief of Station, Algiers

## SUBJECT

Monthly Report/Errol S. KULPA

## ACTION REQUIRED REFERENCES

1.  Attached find contact and subject reports covering activities of KULPA during the month of January 1963. The two outstanding characteristics of this project remain a helter-skelter operational pattern and the usual difficulties in administration.

2.  We can not really blame KULPA for the former. His forte is moving around and being able to convince. These two qualities are rare enough not to demand in too loud a voice for the third--serious concentration on a long range target. It is not that KULPA lacks the professionalism, rather it is the tempo of his personal and professional life that inclines hin to speed rather than accuracy. As last month was marked by the stop and go of SCIMITAR/6, so this month was hampered by the upcoming Congo voyage. It is not that these ventures are unimportant, it simply remains difficult to judge KULPA's performance on events occuring outside our area of competence.

3.  We can say nothing new or nothing untrue on the administrative aspects of the project. The cry is the same from all small stations--why must so much valuable time be spent on tiny administrative detail. In KULPA's case the matter is perhaps compounded by his transfer from Casablance but his complete file is living evidence of the imbalance of the outside staffer. In the regular four way breakdown, the file reflects almost no paper in Plans and Development, Production is not fat, Operations is fuller but transitory, Support is a swollen, blistering monster. ter. We see no end to it. Our present agenda for the next KULPA meeting calls for a discussion of eleven separate administrative items. One more chestnut and we are finished. The KULPAS of the world take precise careful case officoring with sufficient time prior and post the meeting to bring order from chaos. It is just this time that a small station lacks. So far, we are glad to state, KULPA seems to be. worth the price paid.

FROM: Chief, LCPIPIT/London

SUBJECT: DTDORIC/MHPROBE/Operational ORPHONE/British Immigration Status

ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES

1. On 12 March 1969 QRPHONE/1 was granted an extension on his British visa valid until 15 February 1970.

2. Since QRPHONE/1's file at the Home Office indicates an interest on the part of JAGUAR in his case, JAGUAR was consulted prior to the issuance of the extension. (This is not unusual in the cases of persons such as QRPHONE/1 and does not necessarily imply an "agent" status. Of course WOFIRM is not mentioned at all in this file.) In coordination with London Station it was decided that a re-newal of QRPHONE/l's one-year visa was preferable to the granting of permanent resident status--which would normally have been the case. We quote from the appropriate memorandum from JAGUAR to London Station on this matter:

"The choice was between:-

a) an extension of two months

b) an extension of one year i.e. a repeat of what was granted to him last year

c) that his temporary residence should be made "unconditional" which would be the normal procedure if there were no special considerations.

Our feeling was that for QRPHONE/1's cover purposes (c) would be undesirable; if his friends got to know of it they might think he was being treated over-generously in view of his contacts with leftwing revolutionaries such

Previously she had taken part ir a number of CIBSOT’s activities, for instance “the HANCHANDA attempt to break up the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign”.

1.  A secret and reliable source states that. TARIC ALI is certain that GIBSON is working for the Americans. He claims that the Chinese have documentary proof of this, and for that reason they removed him from the editorial board of “Revolution”, the Paris magazine they were financing. GIBSON had then come to London.

2.  TARI ALI says 01330N is very wealthy but no-one knows where his money comes from. From time to time he hands out donations to sympathisers saying that they arg “on behalf of the Chinese”.

The Congress was officially sponsored by the Algerian Committee of Solidarity with Palestine.

2. The participants, for the most part, espoused the Chinese thosos regarding the "People's War" and appliod these theses to the Palestinian struggle. while net directly criticising the Soviet policies 1. the Middle East, it was evident in the Congress documents that the Europear militants sought to do so. For example, they strongly condeened the United Nations resolutions on the settlement of the Hiddle Rast conflict. The main conclusions of the Congress vero: an acceptance of the Al Fatah as 'eing the only geruine Palestinian revolutsonary organization, and a decision to create an information bureau in Ligiers which will be run by Palestinians. The bureau will provide information on developments in the Palestinian revolution to all the Palestinian committees throughout the world and to all revolutionary movements which support the Palestinian people. la conjunction with those Palestine committees, the fureau vill sponsor meetings, lectures, delates, fila shows and an annual conference. (Source Comment: Abu el Hassen,
   a prominent leader of the Palestinian delegation, confided to one of the delegaten after the Congress that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) would probably sponsor a conference in Jordan sometine in 1970 or 70 or 1971.

some of the Algerian participant-observers, they were not:
altogether pleased with the Congress, feeling that its con- clusions vere excessivelyfoftist. The chief spokesman for the Algerians was M'hamedy a z 1 d. who is the Algerian representative on the I'nited Nations Security Council.

4. The delegatch slept at the Zeralda Tourist Center located about eleven ailes from the (lub des Pins, and were Lussed daily to the Congress site. The Algerian hosts sav to it that the delegalns were kept busy and together. Strict security was maintained and the delegates had no chance to single with the Algerian people. There was no list of delegates and several of the participants used pseudonyms.

5. The first session of the Congress on 26 Decealer, which included the attendance of a large group of Algerians, was chaired Ly Larbf Bentouni (Algerian). (Field
   Comment: TDCSI-B 315/05408-69, dated 31 December 1969, described Bentoumi as the Algerian defense lawyer in the recent trial in Switzerland of the three Palestinian terrorists charged with attacking an El Al Boeing 707 in Zurich in February 1969.) Most of the first session was devoted to assigning the delegates to the commissions and in arpanging the timing of the various speakers, such as YasiArafat, Al Fatah's official spokesman and chairman of the PLO. Upon the recommendation of a Palestinian representative, the Congress yoted Ly a majority of 33 votes to create three commissions Tor the event. These vere commonly known as follows: Political Commission, Information Commission and Organization Cossission.
   (Source Comment: The Palestinians obviously had come to the Congi ses with only one inmediate practical aim, 1.e., to obtain loft-wing acceptance of the creation of a Palestinian information bureau.

6. At the loginning of the second day of the Algiers Comgroas, 27 Deceaver, Bentouni ceded the chair to Nabil of the PLO. For the rest of the Congress the Algerians played no active role, thus leaving the Palestinians with considerable trecere of action in the proceedings. The

1. Palestinians took over the chairmanship of the three commissions and guided much of the work of these groups. A (Comrade) "...u t" from Paris chaired the Information Commission;
   Abu Hassan chaired the important Political Commission. (Field Comment: Source did not know the name of the Palestinian who chaired the Organization commission.)

2. The most important Congress document was a political declaration which had been drafted in the Political Commission mainly by Abu El Hassan and Alhimanyata Hanchanda, a British citizen of Indian descent who is chairman of the pro-Chinese British-Vietnam Solidarity Front (B/VSZ). (Source? Comment: Hanchanda confided that he was not completely satisfied with the text of the document, but considered it worthwhile nonetheless because it came close to what he considered were general Chinese positions, although it did not condemn the Soviet Union by name. Abu El Hassan and other Palestinians congratulated Manchanda for his success in ramming through such a hard-line political document. Manchanda had in fact dominated the final plenary session of the Congress on 28 December which voted affirmatively on the declaration. On one occasion during the discussions in the Political Commission, Yazid tried to persuade the Commission (whose revolutionary commitments he claimed to share) that it should go easier in its condemnations of the United Nations.

3. Delegations from the following countries were represented at the Congress:

a. Austria - Represented by an observer from the Moscow-lino Communist Party of Austria

b. Belgium - a divided delegation headed mainly by Reno Raindorf but which included a few supporters of Jacqueri Rippa, a current political enemy of Raindorf.

c. Brazil - Represented by a youth named McGill who lives in London.

d. Great Britain (two rival delegations)
Delegation led by Manchanda as follows:

(1) Manchanda, representing the Solidarity Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Arab Peoples, and the Revolutionary Marxist-Leninist League

(2) Diana Langford, of the Women's Equal Rights Campaign

(3) Mike Grylitsias, of the Revolutionary Marxist-Leninist League

(4) Mishek Chinamassa, of the Zimbabwe Students Union in Europe (ZSUE). (Field Comment: An official British Service reported in August 1969 that Chinamassa was expelled by the executive committee of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU) as president of the ZSUE.)

The newspaper, however, lists its editor as "Aziz Yafi". Armanazi had supplied the airfare for this delegation because he did not want the PSC people to go to Algiers under the arrangements of Manchanda. All of the PSC people were young and no match for Manchanda who, in the final session of the Congress, was able to isolate them completely inasmuch as they opposed the recognition of Al Fatah and the establishment of the information bureau in Algiers.)

e. Italy - Represented by delegates from the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (PSICP). They decided to be in an observer status, although they were entitled to be participants by the fact that they belong to a Palestinian Solidarity Committee in Italy. The only open political opposition to the overall political line of the Congress came from the Italians who passed out a statement at the final session deploring the importation of left-wing quarrels into the issue of Palestine.

N.B. BEN BELA REALISTED ART OF THESE VIES RE KEPT PRIVATE.

1. The moment of crisis in Algeria is over, and relatively speaking a bronthirs spell is here. Opposition is di, with the stid nts and labor undone von over, th Federation disbended, other oprostion dispersed or ton organized to be effective, and the people persuaded to give Ra Bella's zovement a lengthy and sincere support to overco Algeria probles. Por the ret tire sirce cerging froprison, Bor Balla lo getting six or seven hours sleep per dent. He is relaxed, atin, considert.

2. Algeria's greatest probles now is recore'raction of the economy, incluiry housing, agricultrual reform, dare and irrigation, and so e roads. In this repret, foreign aid is essential. He wishes that talks with the U.S. could start as soon as possitle, and feels the best method to do this is to have an ecomate delegation visit Alerta to see on the spot the needs and special onditions. (He rensato! several times that he wisnet the talks cold start as soon as possible.; As for aid, he does not wish aid "which will help us eat better or have a higher ste-dard of living" but rather aid trich be of a developmental, constructional type" to permit the Algerian esonozy to lp itse f. In reply to the question whether he hoped more id would come from the U.S. than from Rusala, he said "I hope so, I hope so." (He gave the alicht impression he felt the U.S. was much better equipped to aid.. The preliminary estimate of the government co nittee for the reconstruction f Algeria Anakin is one numired billion france. This figure might go higher, but the final figre will be what Algeris will ask from France in additional help over the next two years. He stressed his appreciation for the American Ashassador, r. Porter, saving one of his wont valuable qualities is that he astually loves t's Algerian people, a trait extremely appreciated by his and the Alpertar. people.

3. The above he pis in addition to the ropular strutive tudget and the operational budget. The edinistrative budget of 280 billion france is a balanced budget, with ceipts - maially because of the new taxseexpected without fail to equal expenditures. de mentioned several ti es that Algeria is too proud to sak anyone alde to pa its asinistrative budget, l.e., pa its running ex-enses.

4. On the question of the canoy, there will be a code cotablished soon which will delimit the private and public sections of the ecorary. He wes peeved that some people do not believe there will be a private section, and said "People will soodday 1 arm to take re at word. If I didn't man it, I didn't have to say it. And if I change my mind, I will say that too, and I dil give the reasons. But, there will be aprivate section of economy, and we do want foreign private investment."

He contrasted this with the resistance of the Russian paasant "ahish caused the slaughter of ni lions of Russians from which Fundian agriculture has not yet recovered". He fonla oven if produstior on thess million the stares is lower than it wasundr "rench control, it is definitely worth it, since the profits won't go to on rich class which spends the money on the Riviera but will greatly boost the peasante' standard of Hig.

In this respet, he was dafinitely not in agreement with Prof. Drmont's major eriticisms of Algeria given on Jammary, and co told te professor in private.

6. With respect to Cuba, He was disappointed to return home to find that the nisale bases did exist. Hie wain hope in visiting Cubemes he told President Kennedy quite frankly but errostlye was to help lover terpentures. He had edriced President Kennedy not to invade, andhe had advised Castro to be more dicerest in acceptance of are. The end result was not disappointment, however, since no man en be disa pointed if a melear var has been avoided."

7. The U.S. resstion to the Yemen revolution disappointed hin also, and he felt UiS. early actions were mistakes. It had appeared relations between Cairo and Washington were going to well prior to the Yeran erisis, andit had been a shans to ruin good relatione. U.S. rocognition of the Republic of Yemen however was highly valcone to him, and he feels this all do such to return U.S./Cairo relations to the previos high plane.

8. With respect to a United North Africa, he fools the time to act is now on a cultural and coonomie level. He feels identical textbooks, exchange of teachers, cult ral exchanges, lowering of frontier custon and adxinistrative barriers, ete. will start a movement shich in the and will fares constantly greater unity, even if the politicians don't really feel the time is ripe. He feels this es especially true in education and the exchange of econorale advantages, such as procud ng electricity from Oujda for Karnia or Ylezeen instead of from Oren.

9. "Upon his honor as a man" he swore he nor any Algerian had anything to do with the attempted assassination of Bourguiba. He also felt sure the two Youssefiste in Algeria, who are good friends of his, had not ing to do with it. He felt his friendship with these two persona ught have led to zamanda suspicions that Algeria was involved. He said "th t in not my way, and I have too many probleme of my own to meddle in Tunisian af airs. It was a plot ounted andsupported in Tunisia itself."

2.  Beeglin has sccepted me as being very leftist, "chjestive, and perhaps ovan coresmist an impression I have matured with him. Thus, his acceptance of us as a like-zinded person gave confidence to the otheres

3.  The evening was a discussion of the Cuban and Algerian revolutions. Schleifer tha more or less the areale, having been in Cuba taise, once for tro months Dsa 60/Jan 61 and recently for nine months. Fersonally, I felt Schleifer is so entirely left that he is a co manist in or rything except postupe the card and the party cabership. He is intelligent, reasons wall, and is obviously well-read, being able to give quotes from books by title of the principal condot authore, capecially Lenin. Es is also fuszy in that be cere to seapest V.3. positions as baing propaganda positions and does not assuad the case for Russian positions. At the same time, he gave va en ippression of sincerity, quite a bit of criticism for Eussia, and an obvious search for the truth. He didn't blink an eye when kathica assumed that we were all Hast, Docialist, and hoped for the oventual implantation of cocialien oven in the U.3."

5. Later I took Schleifer to his room, the home of Richard Gibsan. He was due to leave for Korocco on 9 January, but stayed over to get an interview with Ben Balla which was to be arranged, or *guaranteed* as he put it, by Boeglin. From there he is to go to the States. I asked him what he was doing here, and he replied just traveling. Boeglin hadto'i me he was a sociologist with a stug grant, but Schleifer denied he was a sociologist, volunteering nothing about a grant. He told me Gibson was staying in Algiers to put out a car paper called *Afrique Rovolution* which was to be a big, slick publication with many photos and a selling price which would enable it to replecs Jeans Afrique throughout Africa. When I asked about financing, he said the Algerian government was financing it heavily. He engrested we meet again 8 Jetssary so he could present me to Gibpon who was looking for a photographer, and suggested I could be that photographer at a nominal salary. I replied I would be interested more from the paint ofprestige and publicati on rather than salary since I was doing well in my prosent journalistic endeavor as far as salary went. I was kept from making the meeting, but I talked by phons with Gibson (who speaks Prench so badly he couldn't complete a eamtense on the phone) and the meeting is to be cat up on 10 Jarmary.

LUSTRIKER REPORT #231, Kulpa

Subj: Contacts, Jan 25-29 Jan.

30 Jan 63

1.  Serge Michel: Saw him Alutti hotel, his house, and three times my house. He says Yasid is de facto Minister of Information now, and will become Minister of Information over the next few weeks or month. Michel stayed with El Chanb long enough to get it on its foet, then moved on to plans for Atlas. When Atlas is established, he will move on again to looks on Algeria and rne-shot publications. He is going to the Congo in early April for a week to gather material for articles on Angola and the Congo. He is taking the line that Kennedy and Khrushchev are "allies", with De Gaulle and Kao as enemies; thus Algeria should not support nor attack either one too much. He feels the Afrique Revolution is making political mistakes in this respect by attacking the United States (presumably with an article on Meredith & Mississippi) and can be termed the extreme left in Algeria. He feels Afrique Revolution will be taken over by Atlas staff in six months or less, and run on a less violent basis. Serge talked of his ancestors, saying they were all from Georgia, and that a translator was used when he talked with his grand parents who only spoke Georgian not Russian. He is an apatride with a Moroccan passport (which I saw but couldn't get the number) which contains his nationality as Moroccan, as opposed to other Moroccan passports for Algerians which have the nationality lined through. His father was apatride also, and Serge claims he feels more for Algeria than any other country. He arrived here the first time when he was 20 years old, and from that time lived with algerian rebels. He is 41 years old now. He has three boys, about one year, four and six, all with Russian first names, and occupies a villa in Hydra. His wife speaks French with an accent, Russian I believe. His infant is very sick with asthma.

2.  Richard Gibson & wife: Saw them in his office as result of his request for photos for Dave Katts in New York for the latter's *Liberator* publication, which is a slick, leftist publication with a format something like a cross between Ramparts and The New Yorker. I gave him four photos without my name, but he insisted on putting my name on the back for credit. He said Katts would pay me directly, since he had my address already. He also said I would probably get photo requests from London from a person whose name he didn't remember. This person and Katts are also correspondants for Afrique Revolution in their cities. Mrs. Gibson is white, and appeared to me to be Jewish, probably from Brooklyn, judging from her accent. However, she could be foreign since the accent is difficult to place. Eduardo dos Santos was in the office, but wasn't very friendly. Gibson knew of my trip to Angola, probably from dos Santos via the Congo embassy in Tunis, and wanted some photos when I returned.

3.  Joan Marie Boeglin: Boeglin phoned me, after having missed a luncheon with me last week. He has acted on my request to speak to Jacques Verges about using me when possible for Afrique Revolution. Verges is to meet me tomorrow to discuss photos. I am to bring one-violent action if possible-which is to be used as the first cover of Rev julon, if it is a suitable photo. Boeglin will be there, and we are to meet today to plan the conversation with Verges to make sure I benefit.

4.  Djalal Tchanderli: (brother of U.H. Chanderli, although name spelled differently). He came to my home with Michel. He is going to the Congo to film Angolans in March, and wanted my agreement not to film for my cover company while there. I finally agreed, extracting a promise from his that he would not take any photos, thus leaving me that monopoly in exchange for the film monopoly. He & Michel feel they are related, both families coming from Georgia; & Michel having an uncle named Tchanderli.

1. Serge Michel: Saw him four times at Hotel Aletti, discussed mostly "Atlas". Aged me to prepare six color covers in advance, first one to illustrate ancient Corbusier plan for face-lifting of Algeria which is now planned by Algerian Government. Claims Africue Revolution will be "absorbed" by Itias (probably both under same editorship. Roberto holder: phoned Josie Faion from Tunis, he will be in Rome Saturday, will send ticket and visa for Corso from there. I am to leave soon as possible.

2. Louis Letti, about sixty years, 220 pounds, 5'2", white hair, blue eyes, French, worked in States several years in 1920's speaks English well, friend of most diplomats including Chinese, is accepted by Algerians as being anti-OAS in spirit. He claims the East German government wants full recognition by the Algerians, cited Bern Bell's attendance at national holiday of East Germans, though Scharfenberg is only Charve affairs. Gave me Chinese address as 35 Rue Luciani, El Biar, phone will have me to sure with East Germans whenever I wish.

3. Talb Jarai, Hotel Aletti & the city. Jarai had difficulty with reporters of Republiquedisericadas in rare over "stupid communists". Arain claimed Irving Brown was CIA agent in front of a French radio speakerine.

4. Dr. hajj daou, Jamal Misri, Braham Bouzar, at my home and at their homes. Nothing of interest at conversation.

5. Fru BAZAR, police officer, plus two of his friends, at Roma. Nothing of interest except the three of them: very idealistic, insisting everyone must work to maximum for minimum pay in order build Algeria. Seems to be typical attitude among young Algerian.

6. Zerati police comissioner, Les Pecineries for lunch. Extremely pro-American, talked of all his OIS friends from Morocco at Ben Buerir while he worked in Marrakech. He should be contacted by someone under official cover as being "sent by his old els friends" or some such ploy. He can be developed.

# Jacques Verges

3

10 March 1964

## Physical Details

Verges is about 38 years old; about 5'5" tall and of medium build. He is fair colored, has a Chinese-looking face and wears spectacles. He has dark hair and dark eyes.

## Parentage

Verges was born in Reunion Island which is a French Protectorate. His father is a citizen of that Island and his mother was from Indo-China. He has at least one older brother. The father was a Member of the French Parliament representing Reunion Island. Now the brother Paul Verges, is a Member of Parliament from that Island.

## Martial Status

Verges was married about 1946 but was divorced in about 1959. He has one son from this marriage. It is now heard that he has married again in about 1963 to Jamilia Bouirhead, the famous Algerian prisoner who was sentenced to death but was given a reprieve. He defended her during her trial.

## Personal Habits

Verges was a prominent student in Paris and was from the very beginning a very good debater. He is a charming conversationalist and can keep any audience completely entrapped by his talk. He has been extremely popular with all groups and particular with females. He is very fond of eating well. He takes spicy food which would put even an Indian to shame. He drinks very little, works late hours, sleeps long in the mornings. He has an artistic temperament and food taste.

## Career

In about 1950 Verges started working in the International Union of Students in Prague. There he was Secretary of I.U.S. and later also of International Students' Relief which was formed more or less in his time. He remained there till 1954. After this he returned to Paris and studied to get his law degree. From about 1955 to 1962 he worked as a lawyer in France. As a lawyer he rose to prominence immediately. He was elected to the first Secretaryship of the French Young Lawyers' Body, which is a post of academic distinction. From the very beginning Verges started taking political cases of those who were accused in the various French colonies of "sedition". He was adopted by the F.L.N. of Algeria as the Chief of the Legal Defence Bureau in Paris. He conducted several famous trials including that of Jamila and at the same time carried on the campaign for Algerian independence in France and elsewhere.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 208

some time he was in trouble at the hands of the political groups opposed to Algerian Independence. He was provided a guard outside his house and for a little while had even to leave France to live in Geneva because of fear for his life. Even in the legal defence that be conducted, the basis was entirely political. He was all this period subscribing to an extremist view which may be called ultra-revolutionary. For exemple, in his legal defence his theory was always to justify an act of killing by an accused on the ground that it was part of a war of Independence.

Almost from the very beginning and in any case from 1951 Verges had serious difference with the French C.P. He considered them to be reformists and accused them of being cowardly in their support to the Algerian revolution. He was never a member thereof in this period and often worked against them.

In 1962 he shifted to Rebel as Political Adviser to the King. He was very friendly with a Senior Minister, "Ahmad", and his post in Rabat was brought about by the Minister. However, it appears he did not continue long in this post and was back in Paris in 1963. Now he is the Chief Editor of a political monthly Journal called "Revolution". He is also reported to be the head of the China Lobby in Paris.

## Acquaintance

The writer met Verges in 1951 when he visited Delhi. In 1955 the writer stayed with Verges in Paris twice and twice again in 1958. The last time the writer saw Verges was in Paris in 1961. (In 1951 Verges was in Delhi in connection with an I.U.S. meeting. In 1955 the writer was in Paris on his way to and from Prague in connection with I.U.S. matters. In 1958 he visited Paris going to and from Stockholm for the Youth Festival Preparatory Committee meeting. And in 1961 the writer was in Paris to attend an I.A.D.L. Commission on Algeria.!

Verges has always been very friendly and cordial with the writer and openly discusses his problems, views, activities, etc.

A secret source has provided the following information about "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" and its French counterpart "Revolution" and about the differences between Jacques VERGES, the publication's Director, and Richard GIBSON who was Editor until he was dismissed about two months ago.

2. On 13th August 1954, the Swiss Federal Council banned "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution", which had hitherto been printed in Lausanne, and the Swiss authorities took possession of previous issues and subscription lists. GIBSON was however able to retain possession of one copy of the subscription list as well as distribution records and most of the unpublished manuscripts.

3. When GIBSON was removed from his position as Editor of the publication he and his wife were owed a substantial sum in arrears of salary. Jacques VERGES made no attempt to pay these arrears with the result that the GIBSON took legal action and received judgment in their favour early in September for a sum in excess of £3,500. GIBSON expects that VERGES will be unable to pay this sum or to meet other debts and that he will be declared bankrupt. GIBSON hopes that it will then be possible for Nils ANDERSON, the Swedish printer of the English edition, to take over both the English and French editions.

4. Because of his financial difficulties with "AF, Lat Am, Asia Revo", Jacques VERGES, has had to give up the tenancy of the Paris office of the publication at rue Vavin 139, and has moved to 2 rue Galande, Paris 5e. Richard G.Dson expects he will be declared bankrupt.

REFERENCE: OELW - 20852 (9 December 1963)

1. LCBEFORE reported on 17 January 1964 that Subjects, both of whcs are mentioned in reference dispatch concerning *Revolution Africaine* (GIBSON is a US citizen) and were working from that publication's Lausanne office, have left Switzerland at the request of the Swiss Uvernment. According to LCBEFORE, VEROES departed Svitserland on 25 November 1963 for Latin America casibly Brasi and GIBSON departed on 15 December 1963.

2. LCBEFORE believes that in part it can take credit for these oxpulsions in view of the fact that LCBEFUS-inspirei publi- oity about *Revolution Africaine* has appeared in the 3wiss press and that this publicity helped to draw the matter to the Swiss authorities' attention, thus prcepting them to expe: these two propagandists.

3. LOBEFORE also noted on 27 January 1964 that the November 1963 issue of *Revolution Afriosing* lists Lausaire as a burea. (and Paris as the Hain Office) versas the Cotucer .3 !se. listed Lausanne as the Kain Office and Faris as one of the bureaus.

SUBJECT:
JAGUAR Paper on Revolution

ACTION REQUIRE REFERENCE:
REF: OZLA-40,542(15 April 1964)

1. Reference forwarded a JAGUAR paper dealing with the well-known Communist magazine Revolution. Attached are (1) another JAGUAR note from SVOCK's office, and (2) the paper received with it. Please note JAGUAR's caveats on the use of the material.

2. SKIMPISH also remarked to me, on one recent occasion, that he had learned that Richard GIBSON had been expelled from the staff of Revolution (se is indicated here), but the reason that SMIMPISH gave was that GIBSON had bean accused of working on behalf of "subversive" elements, which SMIMPISH implied to mean KUBARK. Maybe SMIMPISH was speculating on or misquoting this JAGUAR report. I haven't been able to go back to SMIMPISH on this, because he has subsequently gone on leav.

3. We (and JAGUAR) would appreciate any comments on this report.

# "AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA REVOLUTION"

Reports received from a number of sources make it clear that "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" has been in difficulties for several months and it appears that the last issue was No. 11 dated March 1964. The trouble began, apparently, when the French authorities seized copies of issue No. 7 of the French edition, "Revolution", dated March 1964 because of an article it contained on French overseas territories. Creditors became alarmed, fearing that the publication might be banned, and demanded settlement of their debts which were then estimated to exceed £10,000. Jacques VERGES, the publication's Director, tried to effect administrative economies in order to cope with the situation but according to VERGES, Richard GIBSON, the Editor, argued that the Chinese should be asked to pay the debts. Matters worsened when, again according to VERGES, GIBSON persuaded the Lausanne printer to write to Peking and ask the Chinese to settle the publication's debt to him. VERGES regarded GIBSON's activities as deliberately disruptive and designed to produce proof of China's support for the publication.

2. 
Also, VERGES complained that GIBSON was working for Communist splinter groups in Europe to the detriment of the international Communist movement, and that he was dealing tactlessly with the magazine's agents and contributors. The situation was such that VERGES visited the U.K. in mid-July to discuss the position with RABU, a member of the Editorial Board. RABU, who is now Minister of State for Development Canning of the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, was in London for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.

3. 
In July 1964 there were rumors that the English edition had gone bankrupt; but these were denied by GIBSON who suggested that the English and French editions should be made quite separate, and that the former should be published in London. At about this time the split between VERGES and GIBSON became complete and the latter was removed from his position as Editor and from the Editorial Board, which issued the following "warning":-

> "Comrades from New York, London and Accra (Ghana) have raised up grave charges against Richard GIBSON.
> These charges have been confirmed and underlined by Richard GIBSON's present disruptive activities.
> Revolution's Editorial Board has decided to dismiss Richard GIBSON from all his responsibilities and expel him from the Editorial Board.
> 
> "From now on, Richard GIBSON's activities can not in any way engage the responsibility of the review in all its editions."
> 
> for the Editorial Board"

A similar statement was published in "Revolution" No. 10-11 dated July-August 1964.

4. With GI3908 out of the way, VERGES and his supporters were hoping to resuse publication of the English editia.. OIBSON also seemed determined to carry on and it has been reported cat as sarly as June 1964 he ves enquiring into the possibility of publishing an English version in the Yetherlands

5. The only other charge of significance which has cocurred during 1964 has been the resignation from the Editorial Board of Hansa ALAVI who objected to the publication's pro-Chinese attitude. Issue No. 11 of "Africa, Latin America, Asis Revolution" shows that he was replaced by another Pakistani the 78 year old Kaulana Abdul Hamid Khan SHASHANI. EHASHATI, who lives ir.

The newspaper, however, lists its editor as "Aziz Yafi". Armanazi had supplied the airfare for this delegation because he did not want the PSC people to go to Algiers under the arrangements of Manchanda. All of the PSC people were young and no match for Manchanda who, in the final session of the Congress, was able to isolate them completely inasmuch as they opposed the recognition of Al Fatah and the establishment of the information bureau in Algiers.)

e. Italy - Represented by delegates from the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (PSIUP). They decided to be in an observer status, although they were entitled to be participants by the fact that they belong to a Palestinian Solidarity Committee in Italy. The only open political opposition to the overall political line of the Congress came from the Italians who passed out a statement at the final session deploring the importation of left-wing quarrels into the issue of Palestine.

# AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA REVOLUTION

1. Origin

The monthly publication "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" is the successor to "African Revolution" which was the monthly English digest of the Algerian weekly "Revolution Africaine". "Revolution Africaine", which is published in French, first appeared in February 1963 with the declared aim of helping to build socialism in Africa. In order to increase its effectiveness it began to publish a monthly edition, "African Revolution", consisting largely of material selected from previous issues of "Revolution Africaine". The editorial office of "African Revolution" was established in Lausanne, Switzerland by March 1963 and the first issue appeared two months later.

2.  When the first editor of "Revolution Africaine", Jacques Mansour-VEROES, was replaced by Mohamed HARBI in May 1963, he left Algiers and took control of "African Revolution" in Lausanne. After two issues had been published the connection between it and "Revolution Africaine" was covered and "African Revolution" became "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution". In December 1963 the editorial board moved from Lausanne to Paris, and the publication now appears monthly in English and French, although the two editions are not identical. The former is printed in Switzerland and the latter, which carries the title "Revolution", is printed in Paris.

*Editorial Policy of "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution"

3. The Editorial "Europe too . ." in issue No. 8 (December, 1963) urged the European working-class movement to take up the revolutionary struggle. Thus "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" made it clear that it intended its message to have a world-wide application. At first, however, it had directed its attention to the destruction of colonialism in Africa and the establishment of national independence and socialism, and had later acknowledged the logic of its arguments by changing its title to "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution".

4. To begin with, "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" did not give the impression that it was advocating any particular brand of socialism. The Editorial on "Ideology" in issue No. 3 acknowledged the existence of various types of socialism in Africa and recognized that they were based on the "profound logic of experience". In time, however, it became increasingly apparent that the publication was lending its support to the Marxist-Leninist theory of revolution, and the Chinese Communist interpretation of it. The principal article in issue No. 7 (November, 1963) which had the anodyne title "Third World? Which Third World?", was largely an exposition of the Chinese Communist attitude towards the national liberation movement, drawing material and inspiration from the Chinese Communist Party's document "A proposal concerning the general line of the International Communist Movement". (This was the letter, dated 14th June 1963, from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; it is a major document in the ideological dispute between the two parties.) The article contained the following quotation from the Chinese letters:

> "The various types of contradictions in the contemporary world are centered in the vast areas of Asia, Africa and Latin America; these are the most vulnerable areas under imperialist rule and the storm-centers of world revolution dealing direct blows at imperialism."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 223

# SECRET

-2-

As if to emphasise the extent of Chinese influence in the publication's policies and at the same time to denigrate those Communist Parties which supported the Soviet line, the Editorial in issue No. 8 referred scornfully to "the proponents of the peaceful road to socialism" and the "treason of the revisionists", and proclaimed the end of the "isolation in which revolutionary Marxists have been held because of the revisionism of the leaderships of the Communist parties". Clearly, therefore, "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" supports the Chinese Communist argument that it is most unlikely that socialism can be achieved by peaceful means.

5. "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" has for the most part shunned theoretical discussion, although issue No. 9 (January, 1964) has a heavier ideological content than previous issues. It has made its appeal in extremely practical terms its range of subjects has been wide and by no means confined to politics. Appendix A contains a list of the articles, and the names of their authors, which have appeared in issues 1 - 2 of "African Revolution" and issues 3 - 9 of "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution".

## Chinese Support and Influence

6. When VERZOES was in Peking in the early part of 1963, the Chinese agreed to take out 3,000 subscriptions to "African Revolution" and these were in due course transferred to "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution". It is quite likely that this was a form of subsidy and, initially, when the publication sold for 5s. Od., it was worth £750 a month. An article in "Newsweek" dated 9th March 1964 refers to a report that the Chinese Embassy in Berne provided the publication with £25,000 in 1963. In addition, each issue has contained at least one full page advertisement of Chinese Communist publications. In those circumstances, it is not surprising that it has been stated that the Chinese are in a position to control to some extent what appears in "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" but no clear, reliable information is available to show how this is done. The publication has also had contact with the Chinese through Abdul Rahman Mohamed BABU, a member of the Editorial Board who is now Minister for External Affairs and Trade in Zanzibar. He visited China in 1960, became the East African correspondent of the New China News Agency in 1961 and went to China again in October 1963.

## Cuban Support

7. A Spanish edition of the publication was envisaged as early as May 1963 and it has been reported that members of its staff have been in touch with Cuban diplomats in Europe with a view to the latter editing the proposed Spanish edition. There is however, no confirmation that it has yet been published in Spanish. It may be that this Cuban connection was of assistance in providing the pictures of the Cuban revolution which appeared in issue No. 3 (July, 1963).

## Contact with the Communist Splinter Group in the U.K.

8. By the end of 1963, "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" had established contact with the Communist splinter group in the U.K. which is sympathetic to the Chinese line in the Sino-Soviet dispute. Publications of this group - the British Committee to Defeat Revisionism, for Communist Unity - were advertised in issues No. 8 and 9. An article on "The Fight Against Revisionism" by Michael McCreery the leader of the group was published in issue No. 9.

Staff, Editorial Office and Agencies

9. The following persons are listed in issue No. 9 as members of the Editorial Staff:-

Director Jacques W. VEEGES

Editorial Board Hamsa ALAVI - Pakistan
A.R. Mohamed P:BU - Zanzibar
Amilcar CABRAL - Venezuela
Richard Thomas GIBSON - U.S.A.
Nguyen KIEN - Vietnam (This is believed to be a pseudonym)
Hassan RIAD - U.A.R.
Castro DE SILVA - Angola

The same names are listed in issue No. 6 of "Revolution" as members of the editorial staff of that paper.

10. Secret sources have reported that the Business Manager of "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" is Nils ANDERSON, a Swede, and the Legal Advisor Barnard Arthur MARDER, a U.K. lawyer whose main task is to check proofs. Brief pen-pictures of some of the individuals prominently concerned with the production of the publication are given in Appendix B, from which it will be seen that, of the ten persons named in this paragraph and paragraph 9, at least three are Communists and two Communist sympathisers. Appendix C contains details of the Editorial Office and Agencies.

Publication and Circulation

11. "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" is published by Nouvelles Editions Internationales and is printed in Switzerland. The circulation of the English edition is believed to be about 20,000 while that of the French edition, which is printed in France, may be as much as 50,000. The English edition is given a world-wide distribution.

RICHARD GIBSON
CIRUR A LALALAND

"AFRICA, LATIN AMERICA, ASIA REVOLUTION"

The following information was received in the first half of October 1964 from a source in close touch with Richard GIBSON, the former Editor of "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution".

2. GIBSON was aware that a member of people had thought that the Chinese Communists had provided some financial backing for "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution", but this was true only to the extent that the Chinese had a standing order for 3,000 copies of each issue of the English edition. If the Chinese had given more general financial assistance VERGES, the publication's Director, would not have had to contend with the present financial difficulties and possible bankruptcy.

3. VERGES had had access to a relatively large sum of money which had been held in Switzerland from the time of the Algerian war of independence. When this had dried up VERGES had been unable to replenish it. Reports that VERGES had stolen this money were not true.

4. The publication owed 40,000 Swiss francs to a business-man, possibly Swiss, named KESEL and 30,000 francs to the French printers. In GIBSON's view too much money had been spent on maintaining prestige offices at 40 rue François ler, Paris.

5. When "Africa, Latin America, Asia Revolution" was banned in Switzerland all except 100 copies of issue No. 12 were seized by the Swiss authorities. These 100 copies had already been sent to GIBSON.

6. The French edition "Revolution" has not appeared since August 1964.

LCREPRE Draft of Round-up on Exopolitics

REF: OELA-42,233. 5 January 1965

1. As noted in Ref, mention was made during one of LCREPRE's bi-weekly meetings that I did not attend, of a "round-up in preparation". The apparent antecedent was Richard Thomas SIRCUS, and I undertook to find out from LCREPRE just what was what.

2. As it turns out, LCREPRE was preparing a round-up of information re Exopolitics, rather than on SIRCUS. In response to my somewhat agitated query (due to recent traffic relating to OIBO19, in particular), LCREPRE rushed forth with the rough draft of their resume-ur, which is attached. They point out, however, that this draft is completely uncleared; it has not made the rounds of the responsible political departments and should not be regarded as a final product. In addition, it should be noted that it is intended, when completed, only for circulation within the EXOTER government - principally in overseas elements - and not for general publication.

3. LCREPRE, after expressing the foregoing qualifications, invite any contributions that KUERE would like to offer. The substance of the round-up seems to offer little room for controversy, although's UDEER/ISC may be able to contribute additional information. We also wonder whether the English-language edition has made any impact in the Eastern Zehnisphere.

4. We assume that the appendix of personality data will be forwarded to us along with the final draft, of the final edition.

DRAFT SECRET

1.  During the past year *Revolution* and the *Review of Africa Latin America Asia Revolution* have undergone some important changes. For a time during the past it was reported that the publication was in financial difficulties but in the most recent French edition, No.12, dated October-November it was announced that the magazine would continue on a new basis, with an enlarged Advisory Board, appearing every two months, not only in an English and a French edition but also in a coming Spanish edition to be published in Bogata for Latin America.

2.  The changes which are being made do not in any way alter the pro-Chinese complexion of the magazine. Though the magazine now seems on a much firmer financial basis, there is as yet no evidence that the Chinese are directly subsidizing it. They are however buying copies and taking advertisements.

It has been reported that when Verges was in Peking in the early part of 1963, the Chinese agreed to take out 3,000 subscriptions to "Africa *Asia*" and these were in due course transferred to *Africa Latin America Asia Revolution*. When the publication sold for five shillings, this was worth £750 a month. Each issue has contained at least one full page advert. ement of Chinese Communist publications.

3.  The publication has also had contact with the Chinese through Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu, a member of the Advisory Board who is Minister for Commerce and Co-operatives in the Tanzanian Government. Babu visited China in 1960, became the East African correspondent of the *New China News Agency* in 1961, and went to China again in October, 1963.

4.  By the end of 1963, *Revolution* had established contact with the Communist splinter-group in the UK, led by Michael Loffre, which is on the Chinese side in the Sino-Soviet cold war.

# SECRET

The French weekly

Entitled *Revolution*, this is now published by S.A.R.L. Nouvelles Editions Internationales, 19, rue Gît-le-Cœur - Paris 5°. The first issue of *Revolution* in September, was published at 40, rue François 1er - Paris 8°, printed by "La Cité", Lausanne, Switzerland, but bound by Etrigny, France; then in the spring, the Director, Jacques M. Vergès, had run into financial difficulties, he found cheaper premises for his editorial office at 52, rue Galande - Paris 5°, and with 10/11 of July/August changed his printers to Offset-Presse.

It seems that *Revolution* was in financial difficulties for several months. The trouble began, apparently, when the French authorities seized copies of issue No.7 of the French edition of March 1964 because of an article it contained on French overseas territories. Creditors became alarmed, fearing that the publication might be banned, and demanded settlement of their debts which were then estimated to exceed £10,000. Jacques M. Vergès remains Editorial Director with the following as Advisory Board ("Collaborateurs à la page, entre autres"). New-comers to the Board since the last issue in July/August are marked with asterisks.


Lohane: Zanzibar

Moulana Wul Hasie Theo Chustani Pakistan

Anilcar Cabrera Venezuela

Doba Diallo Arali

Nguyen Hieu Vietnam

Hassan Gias IUAR

Castro da Silva Aut Angola

Carlos Ferran Aspata

Marconal Ferrer Colombia

Abdul R/Karim Malaya

The first change of the original Advisory Board came with the inclusion in No.8 of Kartin Valdes - Spain. The next change was in issue No.9 when Hanza Alavi - Pakistan-was replaced


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 237

Maulana Abdul Esaid Khan Khashani also from Pakistan.

It was reported that Hamza Alavi resigned because he objected to the publication's pro-Chinese attitude. An important further change came with the appearance of issue No.10/11 last July in which was prominently published a "Communique" announcing the dismissal from the Advisory Board of Richard Gibson. The Communique accused Richard Gibson, is an American Negro, of having "used his former position as secretary to the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" to infiltrate the International Revolutionary Movement". Some details of personalities are given at appendix.

7. In Revolution No.12 it is claimed that the total issue of the new and enlarged bi-monthly magazine, including French English and Spanish editions, will be 50,000. However, since his dismissal, Richard Gibson has stated that, during his time on the magazine, while about 20,000 copies of the French edition were printed, the top sale of any issue was never more than 7,500 copies. In the case of the April No.8 issue, he says that the total sale in France was 3,000 copies. The prices of Revolution are given as: Africa: 2.5 dirham, 2.5 dínars, 150 C.F.A. Europe: 4.50 Francs. This represents a 15% increase in the price of the French edition. But this is accompanied by a lowering of the price by 35% in countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. Those taking out annual subscriptions are informed that they are entitled on request not only to make use of *Revolution's* Documentation Centre & International Workers' Movement and the Struggle for National Liberation, but also to free copies of the magazine *Peking Information*. Those taking out a long-term subscription now will also be entitled to "publications in foreign languages from Peking".

8. A main feature of issue No.12 is a leading article by Jacques Verges entitled "Hiroshima, plus jamais!" Possibly by coincidence, this was published at the same time as the /

/first ...

First Chinese nuclear device was exploded;

9. The Russian view of *Revolution* was made clear in *Pravda* on June 3 in an article attaching China, containing the following passages: "fractionist groups ... are also involved in the publication in several languages, with Peking's bribe, of a new "international" journal with the high-flown title of *Revolution*."

*The English Edition*

10. Now entitled *Africa Latin America Asia Revolution*, the English edition was originally published in Algiers with the title *African Revolution*. From the third issue onwards it was published in Lausanne as *Africa Latin America Asia Revolution*. In issue No.7 of November 1963, it was announced that the editorial offices were then located in Paris, with the offices of the French edition, but it continued to be printed in Switzerland. In August, 1964, the Swiss Government banned the "printing edition and the transit" through Switzerland of the English edition because they considered *Africa Latin America Asia Revolution* "an organ of propaganda of the Chinese Communists, designed for non-European countries, which does not limit itself to supporting the liberation struggle of the so-called colonial peoples but also propagates the political views of Red China".

11. The last English issue in the old series which has come to hand was No.11 of March. The first in the new series, No.1 Vol.II dated September/October is published in Paris by S.A.R.L. Nouvelles Editions Internationales, from the same address as the French Edition, 52, rue Galande - Paris 5º. This English edition, which was previously similar in format to *Readers Digest*, is now glossy and similar in format to the French edition. Most of the articles in it are re-printed from the French edition *Révolution*.

*The Editorial Board*

12. As with the French edition, the Editorial Director remains Jacques L. Vergès, with the same Advisory Board except except /that ...

that Anilear Cabrera - Venezuela - is not included and that there
are two members not listed on the French Board - New Zealand - a
member of the Peace Liaison Committee of the
Asian and Pacific Regions, and A.M.-Their of the Dien.

13. Prices of this new edition are given as follows: Africa:
    2 shillings: America: 75 cents; Europe: 5 shillings;
    3.50 Francs.

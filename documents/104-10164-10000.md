MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Limited Release from Secrecy Agreement--
Bernard L. Barker and Eugenio R. Martinez

1. In preparing the letter of 18 April 1974 (copy attached) from the General Counsel to Daniel E. Schultz in response to Mr. Schultz's letter of 9 April, I obtained from Ms. Chris Hopkins, WH/COG (x-1325), copies of (1) a secrecy agreement (in Spanish) by Eugenio Rolando Martinez dated 3 April 1965, (2) an unexecuted contract (an executed cop√Ω cannot be located) between the U.S. Government and Mr. Spencer O. Terteling (Bernard L. Barker) and (3) a termination secrecy oath signed by Bernard L. Barker dated 12 August 1966. Copies of those documents are attached.

2. After discussing the matter with Mr. David Phillips, C/WH Division, I prepared the 18 April letter adding the second sentence of the first paragraph at the request of Mr. Joe Skura, AC/WH/CCG (x-1948). After completing the letter, I coordinated it on 15 April 1974 with Mr. Skura and agreed to send him a copy of the final.

3. On 18 April I met with Mr. Schults. I questioned him as to his intentions regarding the information he was seeking as, in the Agency's view, clearly there is no connection between the Agency's association with Messrs. Darker and Martinen and the subject case. Mr. Schults-explained that he, as the lawyer repre- senting thom, foeie obligated to know what they did for the Agency In order that he can make the determination ne to whether it is golevant to the current trial--currently scheduled for 17 June. He mentioned that to daty both Mosers, Barker and Martinos had bean completely unwilling to discuss any aspect of their dutlua with the Agency. Thay had been reluctant to oven acknowladga

their association with the Agency. I explained the Agency's serious
reservations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and
operations that are still in being. I explained that the Agency con-
tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom
Messrs. Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency
association. Mr. Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem. Thus,
in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the
Agency is currently not in a position to give Messrs. Barker and
Martinez blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they
had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily
acknowledged those conditions.

4. I mentioned to Mr. Schultz that if, as a result of the
   discussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes
   that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a
   narrow request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee
   that we would approve such a request, only that we would consider
   it in view of (1) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offer as to his
   needs, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to current
   operations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-
   dence of current and potential Agency relationships.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Request from OGC for Signed Copy of Bernard

BARKER'S Contract

1. On 18 April 1974 Mr. Dietl of OGC asked if I had been able to locate a signed copy of Bernard Barker's contract which we were unable to locate a few days ago. The answer was no. I took advantage of Pete Palmer's presence at Hqs. on TDY to ascertain whether a signed copy of BARKER's contract could possibly/at Station WH/Miami. Pete said with certainty there was no signed copy at Station WH/Miami since much of the material at the Station had been destroyed. Also, since BARKER was terminated in mid-1966, the Station file should have been transferred to Hqs. back then.

2. I passed the foregoing informaton to Mr. Dietl who simply asked that I double check with WH/Contracts and the Contract Personnel Division for same which I promised to do and advise.

NARRATIVE :

TIME:

DATE: '11 March 1971

PLACE:

FUNDS PASSED: Nope RECPT RCVD:

1. AMSNAP-3 reported on 11 March 1971 that the charges, of sale of narcotics levied on Jorge ALONSO, the son of Guillermo ALONSO Pujol (AMECRU-1), were dropped (no exact date given). Jorge was arrested 21 June along with forty others and charged with being a top figure in the heroin and cocaine distribution racket.

2. AMSNAP-3 stated that he had talked with a friend of his, Ray BARKER, on the morning of 11 March. BARKER told him that he had spoken to Attorney Miguel SUAREZ. SUAREZ is a law partner of Fernando FREIRE. FREIRE told SUAREZ that Jorge ALONSO had been released because all charges stemming from the 21 June arrest were dropped by the authorities. Therefore, there will be no trial.

3. CO Comment: It is a sad day when justices can be bought by the likes of ALONSO. The little man loses again because if he were charged with an offense 1/10th the magnitude of Jorge ALONSO's, he would be behind bars for a long time, and to make it worse, Jogo ALONSO can, nov. Ro back ruining lives.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel

ATTENTION : Mr. Paul Wilson

SUBJECT : Bernard L. Barker

1. Reference is made to our discussions regarding the letter written to this Agency by Mrs. Edwin T. Moffett in regard to her son's marriage to Subject's daughter.

2. As discussed with you, Mrs. Moffett was telephonically contacted and was advised that the Agency could not give her any information regarding Subject's possible employment with the Agency. Mrs. Moffett understood this and did not attempt to argue the point. Mrs. Moffett also was advised that her fears regarding the possible kidnaping of her daughter-in-law were not based on any known incident.

3. Mrs. Moffett was also advised that she should contact her daughter-in-law and son in order to get more Information regarding the daughter-in-law's background. Mrs. Moffett said that she had only met the daughter-in-law for a brief time and was not able to ask all the necessary questions.

In response to your letter of March 10, we wish to advise we are unable to provide you with any information concerning employment of Mr. Bernard L. Barker.

With regard to your concern for the safety of your daughter-in-law, we are unaware of any cases of a former resident being kidnapped and returned to Cuba. Furthermore, since it is assumed Mrs. Moffett is a U. S. citizen, such a possibility seem appears rather too remote to warrant justify the apprehension expressed by her family.

# DISPATCH

TO: Deputy Chief, WH/SA

FROM: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: Operational/TYPIC AMCLATTER/1 Progress Report for February 1965

Action Required: None, For Your Information.

## 1. OPERATIONAL CHRONOLOGY

A. During the period under review [AMCLATTER/1] was transferred from the PW Branch to the CI Branch for future handling. Subject's files were turned over to CI on 27 January 1965 and he was informed by his PW case officer of his proposed transfer at a meeting on 2 February. A subsequent meeting was scheduled for 8 February with [AMCLATTER/1] and the PW case officer at which time the latter introduced him to the CI case officer. Subject appeared to be pleased with this turn of events expressing the wish that he could be put to more frequent use and be given a heavier work load. He said that he enjoyed his 2¬Ω year association with his previous case officer but looked forward to getting into a new line of activity, preferably some type of PM activity or investigative work which he claims to enjoy as a result of his previous police experience in Cuba. Subject was told by the CI case officer that his duties would remain essentially the same as they had been and that he should continue his coverage of exile activities with emphasis on any rumors of impending exile raids on Cuba.

B. On 18 February Subject was introduced to [AMBLINK/1] and was told that [AMBLINK/1] would keep in daily touch with him either by telephone or by personal meeting. Subject and [AMBLINK/1] know one another from the time when they both were working in Cuba and both

SECRET

seem pleased with the current arrangement whereby they will be in contact with one another. In addition to this daily contact, meetings are held with Subject and AMBLINK/1 about once a week by the CI case officer to discuss Subject's reporting, as well as any difficulties he may have encountered or guidance he may need. For all practical purposes, however, AMCLATTER/1 is being handled by AMBLINK/1. Subject knows nothing about AMBLINK/1's other operational duties and contacts, and the latter has been instructed to limit his discussions with AMCLATTER/1 to any mutual business at hand. AMCLATTER/1 knows AMBLINK/1 by true name (which he knew in Cuba) and has his home telephone number. During the absence of AMBLINK/1 from the area the CI case officer will meet directly with Subject.

## II. PRODUCTION

Subject provided a number of useful reports during the period under review mainly concerned with proposed MIRR bombing missions over Cuba and details concerning the ransacking of AMBIDDY/1's house. The following disseminations were made as a result of Subject's production:

A. UFG 6635 (WAVE 7900; 3 February 1965) from Frank Fiorini: Alleged abortive Air Raid over Cuba by the MIRR.

B. WAVE 8261 (Rybat; 13 February 1965): Ransacking of AMBIDDY/1's house.

C. UFG-6710 (WAVE 8326; 16 February 1965) from Frank Fiorini: Planned Air Strike Against Havana by the MIRR.

D. WAVE 8419 (Rybat; 17 February 1965): Additional information on Ransacking of AMBIDDY/1's House.

E. UFG-6727 (WAVE 8394; 17 February 1965) from Frank Fiorini: Decision of Orlanda Bosch Avila to Use Cuban Pilot on MIRR's Air Strike of Havana.

F. WAVE 8521 (Rybat; 20 February 1965): Additional information on Ransacking of AMBIDDY/1's House.

G. UTG-8747 (WAVE 8618; 23 February 1968) from Frank Fiorini and Bill Johnson: Insistence of Orlanda Bosch Avila that the MIRR Bomb Havana.

## III. FINANCES

Subject was paid his February salary in the amount of 8433.77. (This amount is arrived at after withholding his income tax from $500.)

## IV. FUTURE PLANS

AMBLINK/1 will continue to contact Subject on a daily basis either by telephone or by personal meetings and will see that Subject's reports are promptly relayed to the CI case officer. Subject has been instructed to continue his coverage of exile activities in the area with emphasis on prompt reporting of any impending exile raids on Cuba. Subject will also continue to report in writing any conversations that he has with Cuban exiles who appear of operational interest and will explore his wide array of contacts for any information that may lead to the identification of Cuban intelligence agents operating in the area. In this connection Subject is currently exploring a lead involving two Cuban mulatto women who allegedly have hit the bolita numbers frequently (six or seven times) and for large sums of money. Subject, who has a theory that Fidel Castro may be using the bolita racket to fund agents in the U.S., is trying to learn the identities of the two mulattoes. He

has been cautioned not to delve too deeply in this matter however since he may become involved with local underworld elements who may take drastic action against him in the belief that he is working for either the local ODENVY or the police. Subject said that he is well aware of this possibility and is making very discreet inquiries with the assistance of certain friends (Cuban ex-policemen) who are bolita runners and who know that he has no interest in their bolita activities per se except to learn the identities of the two Cuban mulatto women. Subject said that his friends, in addition to possibly helping him, would like to know the identities of the two women sincee they would then play the same number as the two women and make some money on their own.

He expects the NYT man--HARPER--to return from Miami this week (I do not know if he meant back to Washington or to New York), and something to appear in the paper some time after that. As I told you, the NYT is convinced there are three related events:

a) The Wetargate affaire.
b) The treat-in at the Chasear Embassy.
c) An attempt to "that up" SERG or the Capitol grounds.

These three everts, at turn, were carried on by a single group of Cuisine ciber.
In fact, they think that GONZALED are another one of the people that mentioned to you were actually in the Vatricage. He managed to escape. He has links not only with the Agency, but also with the cor...parhans separately, but with similar objectives. A very serious charge. That is precisely the connection that the NYT wants to establish. The KIT man claims--according to Ernesto--to have a photo of Manuel GIBERGA, A Cuban who is a White House assistant for Spanish-speaking affairs--and Bernard BARKER, who they think is the key man ("A CLA agent recruiter"), together.

HARPER also visited Felipe PA208, a well-known Cuban economist who, at present, is with the Inter-American Development Bank. Harper might have also seen some Chilean dips, but this is only an inference on my pars.

The other birds on the list that I gave you were specifically tied to the Kilaberg case. They were brought up from Miami--armed--to physically disrupt Ellsberg's appearance before e Congressional Committee. The Cubans were unable to get to him, but did fight with some of his supporters, who were arrested. The Cubans were not. Official protection is what they are looking for in this particular case.

Angel M. Maceda Sanchez (A 14 088 180) a Cuba refugee who was a welder and mechanic employed by the Cuban Ministry of Construction and participated in the construction of silos at Ensenada de Guanabacoa, Regla, Havana. Maceda departed by air from Cuba on 16 December 1965 and arrived in the United States that same day.

1. In 1962 the Government of Cuba drew up plans for the construction of a grain silo complex at Ensenada de Guanabacoa, Regla, Havana on property adjoining an edible oils manufacturing plant which had a daily capacity for processing 300 tons of soy beans. Actual construction of the silo complex started on 3 November 1964 following the September arrival of a number of Polish technical personnel who were to supervise the construction.

2. The silo complex consists of 36 silos, each 37 feet high and six feet (as received) in diameter. The complex is arranged into two groups of 18 silos each with a building to be built between the two groups. The top of the silos will be interconnected by a railway. In addition a system of tubing and pipes will interconnect the silos at the bottom.

3. On deposit in the Graphics Register are four photographs of the silo complex under construction which were probably taken about December 1965. Copies of those photographs may be obtained by requesting the following control numbers:

Field Comment: Maceda, who is not a highly qualified technician, was of the opinion that an inordinate amount of cement was being utilized in the construction of these silos. He also stated that on one occasion a delivery of cement was returned to the cement plant as it did not meet certain technical specifications.

Summary. Fulgencio Batista Zaldivar has an organization in Miami which is composed of a small group of his trusted followers. The main function of this group is in the field of propaganda. Between $5,000 and $7,000 per month of Batista's money is channeled through this group, most of which is spent in support of these antivities. On Batista's instructions, the newspaper *Patria* will adopt a more moderate line, including a friendly attitude toward the United States Government and its foreign policy. Attacks on agencies of the Government and support for RECE, with which the Batista group is making an agreement, will be published in a different newspaper. A Batista confidant left the United States for Spain in January on Batista's invitation.

Florencio Guerra Suarez, former Cuban ambassador

Other trusted members of Batista's entourage include Orlando Piedra Negueruela, "former head of the Cuban National Police, who lives at 1505 Westbrook, Apartment D, New Orleans, Lasisiana; and Atorresagasti (inu), Batista's former military aide and confidant, who is now in charge of Batista's office in Mexico.

2. Members of BAR meet on an irregular basis in an office in Cobas' garage at 2770 S.W. 22nd Avenue, Miami, because Cobas, who is in poor health, does not leave his home. The group monitors news media for items of interest to Batista, particularly those items in which he is mentioned. Members of the group recommend items to be published, and Guerra is responsible for the preparation of a weekly report to be released to the press and radio.

3. The finances of BAR are handled by Fernandes, with the assistance of Saif. Batista provides between $5,000 and $7,000 (U.S.) per month, which is used for salaries, propaganda and other expenses and contributions. Following is a list of some of the regular monthly payments:

Patria newspaper, $2,000

Ernesto Montaner, journalist, $400

Oscar "Bebo" Kramer, for his newscast, $400[^6]

Martha Zlorga Montero, for her radio program, $300[^6]

Rafael Guas Inclan[^3], former vice-President of Cuba, $300

Otto Birgo, actor, $300

Dennis Guell Morales, former Prime Minister of Cuba, $300

Also, Torra, Guerra, Cobas, Consales, Pizzi and others each receive between $300 and $300 each month.

4. Requests for financial assistance are received from other Cuban emigres such as former military and naval personnel and policemen. Often these requests are honored, on a one-time basis, and in a manner that will assure that they do not become permanent financial obligations on the part of Batista. Some publications are financed with Batista's money, such as the book _Historia Cubana_ by Mario Riera Hernandez, a journalist, which was published in the latter part of 1958 at a cost of $2,000.

5. Batista does not contribute a fixed amount of money to any emigre organization. However, he does offer financial assistance to individual members of organizations, particularly those of the Alianna Para in Libertad de Cuba (ALO, Alliance)

for the Liberty of Cuba) which is headed by Ganeroso Campos Marquetti. The majority of the members of the ALC are Batista adherents.

6. At a meeting on 8 December Ruben Batista and Fernandes relayed Batista's instructions to a group of his followers who are explored in the news media. The instructions included the following:

a. The newspaper Patria must take a more moderate line. Attacks on agencies of the United States Government and on emigres who wore formerly followers of Fidel Castro Ruz will no longer be published. The newspaper must adopt an attitude friendly toward the United States Government and its foreign policy.

b. Batista is pleased with the news program broadcast by Kramer and would like to increase the program from one half to a full hour. The expansion of this program is not for the purpose of enhancing Batista's stature, because he no longer aspires to return to Cuba in a position of power. He realizes that such aspirations would be unrealistic. Batista feels that the time that will be favorable for the liberation of Cuba is approaching, and he wants Cuban emigres to re-double their efforts in working toward the liberation.

7. Among others who attended the 8 December meeting were Arnando Garcia Sifredo, editor and publisher of Patria, Alberto Rodriguez Rotger, also of Patria, Kramer, Miguel Angel Antonio Blanco Cortina, a member of Kramer's editorial staff, Saif, and Santiago Rey Perna, a news commentator on radio station VHIE.

Source for para. 8: A Miami businessman who was a resident of Havana for several years. The source has contacts who recognize him as a channel to U. S. Intelligence. The ultimate source of this information is a Cuban emigre in Miami whose reliability cannot be judged.

8. In about mid-November 1965 a group of Batista's followers met at Fernandes' house to discuss policy changes which were considered necessary to prevent persecution of Ruben Batista and Fernandez by Cuban emigres in Miami, and by authorities of the United States Internal Revenue Service. The following decisions were reached:

a. They would proceed to arrange an agreement with the Representacion Cubana en el Exilio (RECE, Cuban Representation in Exile). In this agreement, Batista would support RECE in Batista-sponsored press and radio, and furnish RECE with war material, such as boats and arms. In exchange RECE would pledge to support Batista's political organization in Cuba after Cuba has been liberated. To show good faith in this agreement Ernesto Freyre Varona, leader of RECE, would be asked to appear on a radio interview in which he would indicate "tacit tolerance" of Batista. The agreement between the two groups will not be acknowledged.

b. Mundo Americano will be given financial support. This newspaper will be used instead of Patria for publishing attacks on agencies of the United States Government, and for articles supporting RECE.

9. On 13 January Jose Ignacio Rivero Hernandez, fermer editor of the newspaper El Diario de la Marina in Cuba, said he is planning to publish a newspaper which will be called *Foto Impresiones de la Marina*. Hontaner will assist Rivero in this ondeavor. The newspaper will be financed by Batista. Rivero opined that when this newspaper is established, Patria will no longer be published.

1. Source Comment. Followers of Batista ("Batistianos") fall into two categories: (1) those who are directly associated with Batista, are employed by him, and receive instructions from him or his intermediaries; and (2) those who were formerly connected with his administration and, even though they are no longer directly associated, they remain loyal to him.

2. Field Comment. Source has also reported that Ferrandez' wife, Adela, is Saif's sister.

3. Source Comment. Cobas, Gonzalez, Guas and Sirgo are also journalists and radio commentators. Pizzi vas at one time employed by the newspaper *Mundo Americano*, a job which he received on Batista's recommendation.

4. Field Comment. An independent source reported that Piedra left the United States for Spain during the week of 16 to 22 January. He went at Batista's invitation. In mid-December another usually reliable source reported that it was rumored in the emigre community in Miami that Piedra and Laurent (fnu) wore to meet with Batista in the near future, after they had concluded an agreement with Aureliano Sanchez Arango whereby Sanchez and his group vould cooperate with Batista in an effort to overthrow Castro. Laurent is probably identical with Julio &. Lauront Rodrigues, forser Cuban Chief of Naval Intelligence, Manches is a leader of the Frente Nacional Decoratico Triple A (FNDTA, National Democratic Front/Triple A/).

   Since the death of Leopoldo Pio Elinaldo, Atorresants has been in charge of the publication *Defensa Institucional Cubana*. Formerly Atorrosngasts csaisted Fornandes handling finances, the function now porivred by Saif.

8. Batista feels that it is useless to attempt to finance a war against Castro with personal funds. Such ventures are costly and the results are negative. Therefore, he refuses to consider plans for military action.

**Field Comments:**

9. TDCSDB-315/03734-65 from an independent source, reported that Batista had instructed his representatives in the United States to attempt to gain control of RECE.

10. According to the source of paras, 1 to 7, Freyre has appeared on Kramer's radio program twice.

11. The last issue of Mundo Americano was published in New York on 29 November 1965. An independent source reported that a now weekly newspaper called Nuevo Mundo Americanc will bo published in New York. Rolando Unaferrer Rojas will be the director of the newspaper.

CLASSIFICATION: SECRET

FROM: Acting Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: Operationa1/TYPIC AMCLATTER/1 Progress Report: October-December 1965

ACTION REQUIRED. REFERENCES: FYI

1. During the reporting period AMCLATTER/1 has continued to serve as contact point for matters pertaining to Cuban exile activities and related affairs of possible CI interest. Ille has maintained his large number of contacts within the Cuban exile community, contacts representing such varied sectors as exile political leaders, officials of exile organizations, former members of the police force, as well as suspected underworld characters. AMCLATTER/1's close relationship to Identity A has resulted in a number of reports which were of interest to other Station components and some of which were disseminated. AMCLATTER/L is at his best when asked to furnish information about individuals in the WAVE area who may be of operational interest to the Station; he persues such assignments with the zeal of a trained bloodhound, combing his many and various contacts for information and rarely coming up with a negative report. AMCLATTER/1 works diligently and likes to be kept busy. It is preferable to give AMCLATTER/1 highly specific and detailed instructions, which he will then follow to the letter. When left to his own devices he will at times not use the best operatiorel judgment, which is usually the result of over-zealousness and expediency rather than lack of operational know-how or experience.

2. In November 1965, with the increase in the refugee flow, the CI Branch began using the services of AMCLATTER/1 in interviewing refugees of interest to this Branch and preparing debriefing reports. In this respect he is performing the same kind of work as members of the AMBERVE Team. However, because of his continuing reporting on Cuban exile matter, his many contacts within this community, and the fact that he is known to be in touch with KUDARK among a large number of thi

community, it was decided not to incorporate AMCLATTER/1 into the AMSERVE Unit but rather continue running him as a singleton agent. It was also felt that he responds more favorably under the direction and guidance of one case officer rather than as a team member. AMCLATTER/1 has performed very well in his new duties as refugee debriefer, and his debriefing reports are models of thoroughness, if not of organization.

3. During the reporting period October-December, AMCLATTER/1 conducted a total of 16 refugee debriefings and prepared reports on these. Some of the debriefings required as many as four separate sessions. In addition, AMCLATTER/1 submitted ten operational reports dealing with information concerning the Cuban exile community, the majority of these stemming from contacta with Identity A. Two of these were disseminated.

4. During the period October-December 1965 the following funds were expended for AMCLATTER/1: Salary - $1,344.87; reimbursement for POV mileage and operational expenses - $209.44; total - $1,554.31.

TO: Chief, WH

INFO: WH/C, COS Guatemala City

FROM: Chief of Station, JMWAVE

SUBJECT: DYVOUR/JMPALM/AMCLATTER-1 Production Activities of Roberto ALEJOS Arzu (201-281386)

ACTION: FYI

RID: Please see last paragraph.

1.  On 7 January 1966 AMCLATTER-1 reported the following information concerning recent activities of Roberto ALEJOS Arzu, wealthy Guatemalan emigre in Miami. AMCLATTER-1 got the information from his 19-year-old daughter, who in turn got it in conversation with Cristina ALEJOS, 19-year-old daughter of Roberto ALEJOS, during a visit to the ALEJOS residence on 5 January. The two young women are close friends.

a. Roberto ALEJOS has leased his house at 180 Palm Island Drive, Miami Beach, to an unknown person effective 15 January, for a period of one year. The ALEJOS family will move to another house owned by ALEJOS and located at 2395 North Meridian Avenue, Miami Beach, Telephone No. 538-3148. This house has been used as a guest house for relatives and friends from Guatemala visiting Miami. The house is currently occupied by Rafael CASTILLO Menocal (see copy of his card, attached), who is related to the Cuban MENOCALS.

b. CASTILLO arrived in Miami from Guatemala on 17 December 1965 for a two-week visit, extended since. A close friend or relative of ALEJOS, CASTILLO is

wealthy, in his early 50's, well educated, and speaks Spanish, French, Italian, and English. He is deaf in his left ear. His daughters, who attended schools in Brussels, are also well educated and speak several languages. CASTILLO plans to return to Guatemala on 12 January 1966.

c. Cristina ALEJOS plans to leave for Guatemala on 15 January. For the past month her father has been training her on his properties in Guatemala about which she is to give him a report after her arrival there. Her father is particularly worried about "his large farm which is losing money." ALEJOS has indicated to Cristina that eventually she will take over control of all his property in Guatemala. She will stay with the CASTILLO Menocal family for three weeks, after which she will stay with her father's brother Arturo in Guatemala City.

d. Roberto ALEJOS does not plan to go to Europe this year because of the uncertain status of his financial affairs. He often speaks of his concern about the tense political situation in Guatemala and the danger of a Communist takeover. He is also con- cerned about his daughter's American boy friend, Arthur GORDICK (phonetic), who has had some problems in Guatemala involving the police. ALEJOS has forbidden Cristina to see GORDICK, but she is not complying with his order.

2. Station index files have no traces on Cristina ALEJOS, Arturo ALEJOS, or Arthur GORDICK; nor are there any traces identifiable with Rafael CASTILLO Menocal.

   EQUIPMENT TO THE CUBAN EMIGRES. RECRUITED BY GARCERAN. HE REVEALED

   BE USED BY THE SOMOZA/SCHECK FORCES AS A LAUNCHING SITE FOR A COUP
   AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF COSTA RICA. (FIELD COMMENT: THIS PROBABLY
   INVOLVES THE PLANS OF MIGUEL RUIZ HERRERA, A COSTA RICAN REVOLUTIONARY

# SECRET TO FOREIGN DISSEM

C. GARCEEAN explained that on 4 August he accompanied his Washington delegate, Gerardo MORA, to the home of Col. KELLY, who, according to MORA, has wise military contacts in Washington because of his position in the pentagon. GARCEEAN had prepared a memorandum which he left with KELLY, who was to try to arrange an interview with Secretary, MCNAMARA for GARCEEAN. When GARCEEAN changed his mind about the proposed meeting with Secretary, MCNAMARA, who would probably not receive him anyway because of pressing problems in Vietnam, he returned to the KELLY home on 8 August to request return of his memorandum. He was received by Blanco Ross, who told him that Francisco AGUIRRE had waited to see him but had to leave. She then told GARCEEAN about her mission for AGUIRRE for which she was especially suited because of her relationship to Mrs. Tchite ‚ÄúAURORA‚Äù and because her husband is a U.S. Colonel, whose status would place her above suspicion.

3. No additional information is available to this office concerning Blanco Rosa MAYOBAS.

4. Files of this office identify one Gerardo MORA, of Cuban origin, as a lawyer employed at the CIA in Washington, D.C.

5. Additional information is available in this office concerning GARCEEAN, Francisco AGUIRRE, and Horacio AGUIAR

**SUBJECT**

Receipt of Threatening Telephone Calls by AMCLATTER/1

**ACTION REQUIRED-REFERENCES**
FYI

1.  AMCLATTER/1 reported on 19 April 1965 that he had received that same evening a total of four phone calls from an unidentified party threatening to kill both his wife and himself.

2.  The first three phone calls were received between 1800 and 1830 hours whereas the fourth call was received at 2130 hours. The caller spoke fluent English and used extremely vile language insulting to both A/1 and his wife. The conversation during each phone call was short and made no sense to A/1 who said the caller at one point identified himself as Jerry WALKER when A/1 asked who was speaking. A/1 has never heard of anyone by this name and believes it to be fictitious. The caller also said on one occasion, "Ive been hearing the things you said about me up in Fort Lauderdale." Again, this remark made no sense to A/1.

Re: Threatening phone calls
received by Jrl-251689.

3.  A/1, when offered by his JMWAVE C/O the use of a motel room or safehouse for the evening, said that he appreciated our offer but was armed with a 38 caliber revolver and could take care of himself. He said that his wife and 18 year old daughter agreed with him about staying in their own house since they had fled their home once before in PBRUMEN and did not intend to run again. A/1 is of the opinion that the caller is a crank but has not ruled out the possibility that it may be PBRUMEN intel inspired. He said that one of his friends (IDEN) also had recently received a number of threatening phone calls from someone who spoke fluent Spanish but refused to identify himself by name.

4.  WAVE traces on WALKER are negative.

# Terrorist Plot by Rightist Cuban Exiles See

By Joanne Omang

CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 19

Venezuelan police have uncovered what they believe to be wide-ranging plans by right-wing Cuban exiles to carry out terrorist attacks in the United States and six other nations, according to a newspaper report here.

The respected Caracas newspaper El Nacional said today that the alleged terrorist acts by anti-Castro agents included the killing of Orlando Letelier, the former Chilean ambassador to the United States, in Washington last month, and the bombing of a Cuban airliner off Barbados Oct. 6. The plane crash killed 78 persons.

Venezuelan police have already arrested a group of anti-Castro Cubans including right wing Cuban exile leader Orlando Bosch, in connection with the Cuban plane crash. At least 14 persons have been arrested by Venezuelan security agents and about 30 other Cuban refugees called in for questioning, according to United Press International.

Cuban terrorist plans were discovered in a raid on a private home in Caracas during the investigation of the Cuban plane crash. The reported terrorist acts were planned to take place in the United States, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana, Panama and Colombia, the newspaper said. Past acts related to these plans included the bombing of Guyana's consulate in Trinidad and Tobago, according to the newspaper account.

The wide-ranging terrorist plans reported by El Nacional today were the latest development in a broad investigation in several nations of the Letelier killing, the Cuban plane crash and other incidents.

Letelier, a former ambassador to Washington, foreign minister and minister of defense in the government of the late Chilean President Salvador Allende, died Sept. 21 when a bomb exploded beneath his car as he drove along Washington's Embassy Row.

In Washington, sources close to the Letelier investigation said Tuesday that they expect Bosch to be returned to the United States and to be questioned about Letelier's death. A State Department source said the United States is urging Venezuela to return him informally as an undesirable alien rather than to go through formal extradition procedures.

In Washington, sources close to the investigation of the bombing death of former Ambassador Letelier have said that Bosch is wanted for questioning. Bosch is not, however, regarded at this time as a target of the Letelier investigation, the sources said. El Nacional said that the rightist

> ... detained in Venezuela

[Bosch is the leader of a rightist anti-Castro umbrella group known as the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations. He is wanted in Miami, Fla., for a parole violation stemming from his 1968 conviction for attacks on Polish and other foreign ships.]

The Caracas newspaper El Nacional has previously reported that Cuban exiles arrested in Caracas have implicated two brothers-identified only as the "Novos"--in the Letelier killing. (The paper's reference was apparently to Ignacio and Guillermo Novo, who were indicted in 1963 on charges of firing a bazooka at the United Nations. The indictments were later quashed on the ground that their constitutional rights were violated when confessions were taken from them. Guillermo Novo was convicted in 1974 in connection with a 1968 bombing incident and sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment and 5 years' probation. No more could be learned of Ignacio Novo.)

In Caracas this week, a high government source disclosed apparent links between the present Chilean military Junta and the Cuban exile community in Venezuela. Critics of the Chilean government have accused it of taking part in the Letelier killing. Chilean officials have denied any link to Letelier's death and denounced his murder.

The Venezuelan government source said that the Chilean government has helped finance activities by rightist Cuban exiles against the Cuban government of Prime Minister Fidel Castro. "We've known it for years, but there's no way to do anything about it," the source said.

This and other sources also reported that Bosch was among the Cubans who regularly made trips to South America. Chilean. A Venezuelan socialist has letters written to him by Bosch last January. The letters contain addresses of apartments to be used for guests of the Chilean government.

Authorities in Trinidad have identified two suspects: Herman Lozano and Freddy Lugo, in connection with the Cuban plane crash, according to information reaching from Trinidad. Ricardo Vasquez was carrying an address book listing the members of the U.S. ambassador and an FBI agent stationed at the U.S. embassy here. A U.S. embassy spokesman said the embassy did not know why Vasquez--who reportedly confessed placing the bomb--had telephone numbers.

The Institute for Policy Studies, a Washington-based leftist think tank where Letelier worked until his death, reported Monday that it had been told by the FBI that FBI agents were flying to Venezuela in connection with the investigation. Sources close to the investigation and the Institute said Tuesday, however, that no FBI agents would fly to Venezuela. Instead, the sources said, the FBI stationed in Caracas as the local attaché would help pursue investigations.

PAPER SCORES ACTIVITIES OF *CUBANS IN MEXICO*

Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 2236 GMT 19 Oct 76 FL

[Text] The Mexican daily El Dia in today's edition denounces the existence of real ties between the Latin American dictatorships and the organisations of Cuban counterrevolutionaries financed up by the CIA. The daily affirms that the sabotage of a Cubana de Aviacion airliner has uncovered the radius of activities of the so-called works and their ties with the North American State Department, the CIA and the fascist dictatorship of the continent.

The daily adds that the investigations into the sabotage of the aircraft have delineated the profile of a sinister personage called Orlando Bosch to whom Pinochet's Junta assigned the task of assassinating Chilean revolutionary Andres Pascal Allende.

The daily mentions the charges filed against Bosch, implicating him in the assassination of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and in placing's bomb on the Cuban aircraft destroyed off Barbados.

HAVANA COMMENTARY SCATHES CIA WITH NAZI SS

Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 1730 GMT 19 Oct 76 FL

["Inside the News" commentary by Rafael Berastegui--read by announcer]

[Excerpts] Since its very beginning, the repressive institutions created by the capitalist production system have included espionage organisations.

The criminal machinery at the service of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, perhaps can be compared to a degree to the one which, in the days of Hitler's Germany, obeyed the orders of the SS chief Heinrich Himmler.

The Central Intelligence Agency, which was created at the end of the decade of the forties in the midst of the cold war against the Soviet Union and other nations of the socialist camp, also has as its official function the centralisation of intelligence supplied by the different North American espionage organisations to facilitate the decisions of the U.S. president.

But the book "The Cult of Intelligence" by Victor Marchetti, a former high CIA official, acknowledges that unofficially the fundamental mission of the agency is to carry out the decisions of the President which, if implemented by other public bodies, could cause difficulties. Even though it recruits all types of mercenaries, the established image of the CIA agent is the same stereotype of the supposed superman of the SS troops used by the fascist propaganda.

During the war against the Vietnamese people, the United States confined in so-called strategic hamlets entire populations of southern peasants who were scrutinised by and under the custody of civilians working for the agency.

A special department of the Central Intelligence Agency has the exclusive task of carrying out actions that attest its criminal nature such as coups d'etat abroad, economic destabilisations, attempts against the lives of leaders and others.

Equally, the CIA offers counseling to reactionary regimes in the methodic torture of its opponents. The sinister traditions of the SS troops and its modern continuator, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, coincide in many concrete ways.

Let us cite as last example a CIA protege which bears the initials DINA, considered to be the bestape of the Chilean military Junta and whose last known villainy is the assassination of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier in Washington.
The DINA was organised by Walter Rauff, a former official of Hitler's SS troops who designed the gas chambers for the NAZI concentration camps.

## CUBA SCORES RECRUITMENT OF MERCENARIES FOR US

Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 2233 GMT 19 Oct 76 FL

(Text) Cuba today denounced before the United Nations the recruitment of mercenaries in Western Europe and the United States and their use against national liberation movements and legitimately constituted governments..

The Cuban delegate to the UN Commission on Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Affairs, Miguel Alfonso, declared that there are reliable reports on the increased recruitment of mercenaries as a result of the changes that have taken place in the political panorama of the African Continent.

Alfonso demanded the creation of international mechanisms that would forbid such activities and offered the cooperation of the Cuban Government in attaining such a goal.
The Cuban delegate stressed that the FRG, the United States, France and Great Britain have maintained a growing pace of capital investment and a flow of technologically advanced arms to South Africa.

Miguel Alfonso indicated that the manner and the means with which the peoples struggle for self-determination have not been delineated in the UN Charter or in international accords on human rights. Restricting the peoples from using the means at their disposal--including armed struggle--in the face of the violence unleashed by those subjugating them would practically amount to keeping them at the mercy and benevolence of those oppressing them. Alfonso pointed out.

The Cuban delegate added that Puerto Rico has been transformed into an appendage of the North American economy. It is impossible, Alfonso said, to pretend to be defenders of self-determination in Zimbabwe and at the same time practice colonialism in the Caribbean and neocolonialism in other places.

## HAVANA LASHES AT IMPERIALISM'S HIRING OF MERCENARIES

Havana Domestic Service in Spanish 0000 GMT 20 Oct 76 FL

(Alberto D. Foros commentary)

(Text) Imperialism headed by the United States has increasingly resorted to the recruitment of mercenaries to attack legitimately constituted governments or peoples struggling for freedom. Let us recall, for example, that in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia the CIA recruited what it euphemistically termed irregular forces to assist it in its efforts to crush the massive insurrection of the Indochinese peoples in the areas occupied by the enemy.

Against the legitimate government of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, a government determined to end the terrible economic and social situation of the African population caused by the greedy actions of the mining transnationals and centuries of colonial exploitation, the imperialists also used mercenary armies. The former Belgian Congo, known today as Zaire; continues to pay the consequences of these actions of imperialism.

# Cuban Exiles Arrested
## In Crash of Airliner

CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 14 (AP)-Venezuelan authorities announced tonight the arrests of Cuban exile leader Orlando Bosch and several other persons in connection with the investigation of a Cubana Airlines crash that killed 73 persons near the island of Barbados.

The Interior Ministry said evidence had been found linking one of those arrested, Cuban-born Venezuelan citizen Luis Posada Carriles, with two Venezuelans being held in Port of Spain, Trintad in connection with the Oct. 6 creash.

The DC-8 jet, operated by Cubana Airlines under lease from Air Canada, reported explosions aboard and plunged into the sea off Barbados shortly after takeoff from Bridgetown airport. There were no survivors.

Cuban officials said later that sabotage was a possibility and a group calling itself El Condor, telephoned the Miami Herald and claimed it had planted the magnetic bomb aboard the aircraft.

Bosch is wanted in the United States for questioning on Miami-area attacks laid to exile groups under his umbrella organization. Federal investigators in the case of Chilean exile Orlando Letelier, killed by a bomb in Washington, indicated last week they may have under serutiny Cubana exiles possibly related to Bosch.

SOURCE A FOREIGN DIPLOMAT WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTACTS. HIS
RELIABILITY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.

1. ON 8 OCTOBER 1976 LUIS JORGE MARTINEZ MENOCAL,
   PECOFIRST SECRETARY OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA, SAID
   THAT THE CUBAN EMBASSY BELIEVES THAT THE CUBAN EXILE GROUP
   HEADED BY ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 6
   OCTOBER BOMBING OF A CUBANA AIRLINER OUT OF BARBADOS. (FIELD

10100-76, OF 8 OCTOBER 1976, FROM THIS AND ANOTHER SOURCE OF
UNDETERMINED RELIABILITY.)

2. MARTINEZ SAID THAT THE EMBASSY BELIEVES BOSCH HAS BEEN
   RECEIVING ECONOMIC AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FROM THE UNITED STATES
   GOVERNMENT (USG), VIA ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, SINCE BOSCH IS
   ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT FREELY AND OBVIOUSLY WITH FALSE DOCUMENTATION,
   AS HIS MOVEMENTS CANNOT BE TRACED. HOWEVER, MARTINEZ SAID THAT THE
   CUBANS DO NOT BELIEVE THE USG IS OR WOULD BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN
   THE BOMBING OF THE CUBANA FLIGHT, USG INVOLVEMENT IN THE INCIDENT,
   MARTINEZ SAID, WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE USG'S INTERESTS
   BECAUSE CUBAN PRIME MINISTER FIDEL CASTRO RUZ WOULD SURELY
   BREAK THE AIR PIRACY AGREEMENT, WHICH IS TO THE BENFIT OF THE USG.

3. THE CUBANS, MARTINEZ SAID, ARE CONCERNED ABOUT APPARENT
   CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BOSCH AND CUBAN EXILES WORKING FOR THE CAPRILES
   PUBLISHING CHAIN IN VENEZUELA. SHOULD FREDDY 1. UGO, ONE OF THE
   TWO VENEZUELANS CURRENTLY UNDER DETENTION IN TRINIDAD IN CONNECTION
   WITH THE PLANE CRASH AND A REPORTER FOR ONE OF THE CAPRILES PUB-

## SECRET FURTHER DISSEMINATION AND USE OF THIS INFORMATION SUBJECT TO CONTROLS STATED AT BEGINNING AND END OF REPORT

EXAMPLE OF THIS CONNECTION, MARTINEZ SAID, IS A 2 OCTOBER ARTICLE WHICH APPEARED IN THE CAPRILES PAPER "EL MUNDO" WHICH DESCRIBES AN EARLIER UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON A CUBANA FLIGHT OUT OF BARBADOS AND, WHILE DEPLORING SUCH ACTS, SAYS THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT STARTED THEM. THE UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK DESCRIBED IN THE ARTICLE, AND ABOUT WHICH THE CUBANS KNOW NOTHING, IS BELIEVED TO BE SIMILAR TO WHAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE CASE OF THE 6 OCTOBER DISASTER. THE CUBANS, THEREFORE, BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR MAY WELL HAVE HAD PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ATTACK ON THE CUBANA AIRLINER. (FIELD COMMENT: FOR AN EARLIER REPORT ON CUBAN CONCERN ABOUT ARTICLES APPEARING IN "EL MUNDO," SEE HVC-7495, TDFIRDB-315/09683-76, 27 SEPTEMBER 1976, FROM ANOTHER SOURCE OF UNDETERMINED RELIABILITY.)

4. WITH REGARD TO THE 21 SEPTEMBER ASSASSINATION OF FORMER CHILEAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. ORLANDO LETELIER IN THE U.S., MARTINEZ SAND THAT THIS KILLING SHOWED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF WORK DONE BY THE GOVERNMENT OF CHILEAN PRESIDENT GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET UGARTE. DESPITE SOME MEDIA SPECULATION TO THE CONTRARY MARTINEZ SAID THAT HE DOES NOT PERSONALLY BELIEVE THE USG IS IN ANY WAY INVOLVED WITH LETELIER'S DEATH.

GOVERNMENT (USG), VIA ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, SINCE BOSCH IS ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT FREELY AND OBVIOUSLY WITH FALSE DOCUMENTATION. AS HIS MOVEMENTS CANNOT BE TRACED. HOWEVER, MARTINEZ SAID THAT THE CUBANS DO NOT BELIEVE THE USG IS OR WOULD BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE BOMBING OF THE CUBANA FLIGHT. USG INVOLVEMENT IN THE INCIDENT. MARTINEZ SAID. WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE USGIS INTERESTS, BECAUSE CUBAN PRIME MINISTER FIDEL CASTRO RUZ WOULD SURELY BREAK THE AIR PIRACY AGREEMENT WHICH IS TO THE BENEFIT OF THE USG.

3. THE CUBANS, MARTINEZ SAID, ARE CONCERNED ABOUT APPARENT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BOSCH AND CUBAN EXILES WORKING FOR THE CAPRILES PUBLISHING CHAIN IN VENEZUELA. SHOULD FREDDY LUGO, ONE OF THE TWO VENEZUELANS CURRENTLY UNDER DETENTION IN TRINIDAD IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLANE CRASH AND A REPORTER FOR ONE OF THE CAPRILES PUBLICATIONS: BE DEFINITELY IMPLICATED IN THE AFFAIR. THE CUBANS WILL BE CONVINCED OF THIS BOSCH/CAPRILES CONNECTION. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS CONNECTION, MARTINEZ SAID, IS A 2 OCTOBER ARTICLE WHICH APPEARED IN THE CAPRILES PAPER "EL MUNDO" WHICH DESCRIBES AN EARLIER UNSUCCESSFUL ATTACK ON A CUBANA FLIGHT OUT OF BARBADOS, AND WHILE DEPLORING SUCH ACTS, SAYS THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT STARTED THEM.

Re: EJERCITO SECRETO DE CUBA
(SECRET ARMY OF CUBA - USA)

Dear Arthur.

My Headquarters advises that the above captioned
faction, which is Miami based, has been sending what
appears to be warning letters to several Canadian establish-
ments, public and private, at home and abroad. We had the
handwriting analyzed and our expert stated that those
letters we do have were all written by the same person.

Recently the EJERCITO SECRETO DE CUBA (ESC) has
come to our attention again and we are speculating that
it may be tied in with the UNITED REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION
(URO), headed by Orlando Bosch AVILA, and composed of five
anti-Castro Cuban exile (ACE) terrorist groups: ACCION
CUBANA (AC), FRENTE NACIONAL DE LIBERACION CUBANO (FINC),
MOVIMIENTO NACIONALISTA CUBANO (CNM), BRIGADE 2506, and
THE 17th OF APRIL MOVEMENT.

URO came into being in June 1976 and since that
time has claimed responsibility for several terrorist
attacks, i.e., the airport bombing in Kingston, Jamaica;
the attempted kidnapping of the Cuban Consul in Merida,
Mexico; and murder of an official of the Cuban Institute

Cont'd...

1. Forwarded herewith is a Xerox copy of the Costa Rican passport used by Orlando BOSCH to enter the Dominican Republic in the name of Carlos Luis PANIAGUA Mendez. The passport was obtained and Xeroxed by EMCLIPPER-1 who provided a copy to the Station.

2. EMWISE-15 had previously reported that BOSCH entered the Dominican Republic with a false Costa Rican passport in the name of Pedro Antonio PENA. While BOSCH may be carrying a second Costa Rican passport in the PENA name, it appears that he entered the Dominican Republic with the PANIAGUA passport. The PANIAGUA passport forwarded herewith shows the following:

A. The Department of Migration of Costa Rica issued a visa on 24 March 1976 for travel to "C.A., Republica Dominicana" (p.13).

B. BOSCH departed Costa Rica at Pena Blancas on 26 March (p. 11) and entered Nicaragua (p. 9).

C. The Dominican Consulate in Managua issued a one-trip visa for the Dominican Republic on 30 March (p.14).

D. It appears that BOSCH entered Guatemala City by air on 30 March and departed 31 March (p. 15).

E. BOSCH arrived in Santo Domingo at Las Americas airport on 31 March (p. 15).

3. BOSCH told EMCLIPPER-1 that the real PANIAGUA had undertaken most of the travel shown in the passport, but EMCLIPPER-1 did not establish the date the passport was acquired by BOSCH or how.

4. As reported Ref A, BOSCH was deported to Costa Rica via Managua on 29 August on Iberia Flight 979. EMWISE-15 reported that the PANIAGUA passport was used to deport BOSCH.

MEMORANDUM FOR: LNERGO, Miami

FROM : SRF, Kiani

SUBJECT : Orlando BOSCH Avila

According to a reliable source in Santo Domingo, the Government of the Dominican Republic has decided to deport Orlando BOSCH Avila as soon as security officials can locate him. BOSCH may be deported using a Costa Rican passport in the name of Pedro Antonio PENA or Carlos Luis PANIAGUA Mendez. We suspect that the Dominican Government will insist that BOSCH depart from the Dominican Republic in the name of PENA since this is how he entered the country. There is to date no evidence as to what country BOSCH will be deported.

## Plot to Assassinate Kissinger

A reported plot to assassinate Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger in Costa Rica six months ago was blocked by U.S. and Costa Rican authorities four days before it was to have been carried out.

We have pieced together the story from secret testimony before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee and from interviews with Cuban exiles and U.S. intelligence sources.

A Cuban terrorist named Orlando Bosch Avila was reported to be gunning for Kissinger. The attempt on Kissinger's life was expected, according to reports, during his visit to Coste Rica in February.

Shortly before Kissinger's arrival, Bosch slipped into Cost Rica on a false passport. But the FBI and the Secret Service had been alerted. They traced Bosch's movements and notified Costa Rican authorities. Bosch was arrested and put in jail four days before Kissinger arrived.

The plot to kill Kissinger apparently grew out of his overtures to improve relations with Cuban Premier Fidel Castro in 1973. This reportedly upset anti-Castro terrorist band, Cuban Action, which Bosch headed.

We reported part of the story in 1974 in columns on Sept. 1 and Nov. 19, 1974, we warned that anti-Castro tar Soviets planned an "assassination... against American congressmen and businessmen wite cupported a thaw." We noted that Kissinger had been in touch with Castro.

In Miami's Little Havana. He later redefected to Cuba where he gave a fascinating interview.

"I have known privately since 1972," he said about "the plan to assassinate the U.S. Secretary of State." He said the plot had taken "certain form" by 1973 and had been "actualized" by 1974.

In a reference to our 1974 columns, he added: "This fact, which, I repeat, I've known privately, has been corroborated by the U.S. journalist Jack Anderson."

Rivero named Bosch as one of the 18 anti-Castro leaders who had conspired to kill American and other leader promoting a Cuban-American detente. Bosch had been convicted in 1868 of shelling a Polish freighter with a bazooka while it was moored in Miami. He jumped federal parole and fled to Venezuela in 1974.

Forida's Dade County Public Safety Department, because of the huge Cuban population in Miami, has excellent ties throughout Latin America. In early 1976, the county's terrortst expert. Lt. Thomas Lynch, picked up some ciectrifying news.

He ted the Senate subcommittee about it in secret testimony. "We received information from confidential sources," he testified" that there was going to be attempt on the life of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger... We passed the Information on to the FBI, and they had also received the information, and we notified the Secret Service, so they have the protective duty for the Secretary of State."

The first hint that Kissinger was a target came ister from Carlos Rivero Collado, son of the man elected to the presidency of Cuba. Rivero was active in the anti-Castro underground. The pits was linked to Kissinger's two-day stay in Costa Rirs, and Bosch was picked up and questioned. He was bald can ftas passport charge untii Kissinger was safety out of the country.

Bosch later insisted: "My only crime was entering the country with a false passport." Certainly, it was never proged in court that he hoped to knock off Kissinger. He is now at large somewhere in Latin America.

Johnson's Junkets Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter must have Don Johnson mind when he charges that the Republicans find cushy jobs in the bureaucracy for defeated GOP legislators.

Johnson, a forre Iowa congressman, was appointed by President Nixon to head the Veterans Administration. But he was forced out of office when he proved to be a lackluster leader. So he was shuffled over to the Commerce Department, where he has been ensconced as deputy assistant secretary for domestic and international business.

Johnson has used both posts to travel, mostly to Iowa, where he has kept his political fences mended in the hope of running for office again.

Aino Commerce Dopariment aiona, ho has spent at least $7,000 on travel, $5,204 in the last year. Ho always goes first clam, despite the fact that government regulations require coach travel for federal employees. The enterprising Johnson, however has a ready excuse for his luxury accommodations.

"I'm a heii of a big man," he told our reporter Harbara Taket. "I'm 6-foot-6 and weigh 870 pounds." Johnson also said his had back forced him to fly in the forward compartment. Despite his many excursions to his home state, be denied having any plans for a come back in politics.

# Miami Called Base Of Cuban Terrorists

United Press Internationel

Militant pro- and anti-Castro Cuban groups in the Miami area are engaged in terrorist activities both in and outside the United States, according to closed-door testimony before a Senate subcommittee released yesterday.

The testimony came last May before a Judiciary subcommittee on Internal security chaired by Sen. James O. Eastland, D-Miss. It said that as many as 50 different Cuban groups of various shadings have been operating in Miami at any one time, many of them engaged in violent plots involving local actions and activities in Mexico, Central and Routh America and Cuba itself.

Lt. Thomas Lyons, who has been with the Dade County, Fla., Public Safety Department for more than nine years, and Raul J. Diaz of the department's organized crime, terrorist and security unit, told of efforts to track down terrorist elements in the greater Miami area.

LYONE SAID MOST Cubans in the area are hard-working and industrious, but some individuals "use Dade Country as a base for international terrorism against allied governments of Cuba, Cuban shipping, Communists, purported Communists and individuals who take a stand against their terroristic-type tactics."

During the last two years, Lyons said, there have been four homicides with strong indicators on each that the motivations were political in nature and terroristic by design."

Pies said some Castro groups have infiltrated exile organizations and there were plans to assassinate Latin American diplomats and foreign lawyers.

Lyons said his unit received information from a confidential source early this year that there would be an attempt on the life of Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger during his February visit to Costa Rica.

FBI AND Secret Service were notified, he said. A widely- known fugitive exile, Orlando Bosch, was jailed after illegally entering Costa Rica. There were no incidents during the Kissinger visit.

He did not mention the CIA's own efforts to use Cuban exiles in Florida or U.S. gangsters to kill Castro.

Two weeks ago, the body of underworld figure John Roselli was found stuffed in a chain-weighted, 68-gal-lon drum floating in a bay near Miami. Roselli had testified last year before the Senate Intelligence Committee that he and Chicago gangster Sam Giancana were hired by the CIA to recruit Cubans to kill Castro.

Giancana was killed by unknown persons last year just before he was to testify before the Washington panel.

IT WAS LEARNED yesterday a lawyer for Roselli told the FBI in 1967 that the underworld figure, recruited by the CIA to kill Castro, believed agents of the Cuban leader were involved in slaying President Kennedy.

An FBI "blind memorandum" on an interview with Edward P. Morgan, Roselli's former lawyer, was included in last June's Senate Intelligence Committee report on the role of the intelligence community in the Kennedy assassination investigation. But it did not identify Morgan at the interviewee.

Morgan told the FBI, according to the summary, that Roselli and another client were called on to participate in a government-approved project aimed at assassinating Castro. He said Castro employed "teams of individuals who were dispatched to the United States for the purpose of assassinating President Kennedy."

Egyptian Plane Hijacked, Other Arabs Blamed

CAIRO (AP) - An Egyptian airliner was hijacked today by seven gunmen believed to be Libyans, Palestinians and Lebanese, informed sources said.

The plane was on its way from Cairo to Luxor, 330 miles to the south.

A spokesman for Egyptair, the Egyptian airline, said the plane, a Boeing 727, landed in Luxor, and the hijackers threatened to blow it up unless fuel was provided.

Security men surrounded the plane, the spokesman said.

He reported there were 95 passengers and crew members aboard. Some of the passengers were foreign tourists on their way to Luxor to see the ancient Temples of Karnak and the Valley of the Kings. But their nationalities were not available.
